What is Melora's Starfleet specialty?", "correct": "Stellar Cartography", "options": ["Medicine", "Engineering", "Botanical Science"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStellar Cartography.\n\n\tWe're told early in the episode that Ensign Melora Pazlar is a respected expert in the field of stellar cartography -- she maps star systems. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Rules of Acquisition,\" we hear of the Dominion, the ruling power that seemingly has a death-grip on most of the peoples of the Gamma Quadrant (on the other side of the wormhole just astride Deep Space Nine).  Amusingly enough, the first \"DS9\" character to hear the word \"Dominion\" is Quark (Armin Shimmerman), as he has been sent to the Gamma Quadrant to broker a massive purchase of a certain edible product from representatives of a race called the Doci.  What edible is Quark attempting to purchase from the Doci?", "correct": "wine", "options": ["grain", "spice", "meat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nwine.\n\n\tQuark has been ordered by the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi (Wallace Shawn) to purchase an enormous amount of tulaberry wine. \n"}, {"text": "The fascinating episode \"Necessary Evil\" features a flashback to five years in the past, when Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois) is forced by the still-reigning Cardassian government to investigate the murder of a Bajoran shopkeeper aboard Terok Nor, the station that will one day be renamed \"Deep Space Nine\" by the United Federation of Planets.  One of the suspects in Odo's investigation turns out to be a Bajoran woman named Kira Nerys.  True or False: Kira DID, in fact, kill Bajoran shopkeeper Vaatrik.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAt the time of Odo's original investigation, Kira was cleared of the murder, in part because Odo believed her claim of innocence...but at the end of the episode, we learn that Kira lied to Odo: she really DID kill Vaatrik.  It's a major turning point in the relationship between the two characters. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Sanctuary,\" a ship carrying Gamma Quadrant aliens comes through the wormhole, and the aliens are brought aboard the station.  The \"universal translator\" aboard DS9, however, has a difficult time translating the aliens' language for a while.  Even without the benefit of language, however, the aliens immediately feel something of a connection with one of the regular characters, and this character becomes a sort of ambassador for these people throughout most of the rest of the episode.  Which character?", "correct": "Major Kira Nerys", "options": ["Lieutenant Jadzia Dax", "Doctor Julian Bashir", "Quark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Kira Nerys.\n\n\tThe Skrreeans identify with Kira almost instantly, but they later spurn her when she does not agree with their claim that Bajor, Kira's homeworld, is also the long-lost homeworld of the Skrreeans. \n"}, {"text": "Quark finds himself met with stiff competition in \"Rivals\" when a new arrival on the station opens up an establishment of his own on the promenade, drawing customers away from Quark's bar.

Which one?", "correct": "Guinan, from \"The Next Generation\"", "options": ["Dr. Phlox, from \"Enterprise\"", "Spock, from \"The Original Series\"", "Neelix, from \"Voyager\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuinan, from \"The Next Generation\".\n\n\tIt's stated several times in the episode that Martus (Chris Sarandon, former husband of Susan Sarandon) is an El-Aurian, the same race as Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), the bartender on the ENTERPRISE in \"The Next Generation.\"  Apparently, one can use that \"race of listeners\" thing to his or her advantage when need be... \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Alternate,\" Odo finds himself the victim of a kind of multiple personality disorder, thanks to his being exposed to an unusual set of circumstances.  What caused Odo to shape-shift into a monster of sorts, without any memory of his actions in his \"alternate\" identity?", "correct": "exposure to unexpected volcanic gas", "options": ["exposure to unexpected wormhole radiation", "a transporter accident", "a holosuite accident"], "explanation": "\n\n\nexposure to unexpected volcanic gas.\n\n\tWhile visiting a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where Dr. Mora Pol (James Sloyan) thinks he's found a link to Odo's past, a seismic event cracks open the planet's crust, and exposes the entire landing party to volcanic gas.  Odo seems unaffected at first, but it's later revealed that the gas triggered some kind of \"Jekyll and Hyde\" reaction in the shapeshifter. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Armageddon Game,\" Dr. Julian Bashir tells Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) that he (Julian) once let the great love of his life get away, because he wanted to leave Earth and be a Starfleet doctor.  What was this woman's profession?", "correct": "ballerina", "options": ["tennis pro", "oceanographer", "nurse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nballerina.\n\n\tO'Brien tries to encourage Bashir to get back in touch with this ballerina, but it's a moot point -- the last episodes of the series strongly suggest that Bashir has found true love on DS9 after all, with Lieutenant Ezri Dax (Nicole De Boer).  So much for the ballerina. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Whispers,\" we hear Chief O'Brien (or a reasonable facsimile thereof, not to give the episode away) order coffee from the replicator.  How does he take it?", "correct": "both", "options": ["double strong", "neither", "double sweet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nboth.\n\n\tAt least twice in the episode (and in many others), O'Brien tells the replicator to supply him with coffee -- Jamaican blend, usually -- that is \"double strong, double sweet.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"Paradise,\" two officers from Deep Space Nine find themselves trapped on a planet where technology is not only suppressed, but illegal.

Which two characters uncover this mystery?", "correct": "Odo and Dax", "options": ["Odo and Kira", "Kira and Bashir", "Kira and Dax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOdo and Dax.\n\n\tOdo actually shows some uncharacteristic compassion for a young girl in the colony...even after he knows that she doesn't actually exist as anything but a hologram. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Playing God,\" the station is plagued by rodents left behind by the Cardassians.  These rodents, oddly enough, share the name of a rodent found on Earth.  What are they called?", "correct": "voles", "options": ["chinchillas", "ferrets", "weasels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvoles.\n\n\tThe Cardassian voles apparently chew through power cables.  We see a vole at one point -- it's about the size of an adult Earth housecat! \n"}, {"text": "\"Blood Oath\" features three Klingon warriors who first appeared in the original \"Star Trek\" series.

Only Kor survives...and he later resurfaces in the fourth season episode \"The Sword of Kahless.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Maquis, Part I,\" we learn that Commander Calvin Hudson -- an old, trusted friend of Sisko's -- has taken up with The Maquis, a group of ex-Federation dissidents who resort to terrorist acts in order to prevent dishonorable Cardassians from attacking and enslaving inhabitants of certain worlds along the \"demilitarized zone\" near the border of Cardassian space.  Which actor plays Cal Hudson?", "correct": "Bernie Casey", "options": ["Andre Braugher", "Vondie Curtis-Hall", "Paul Winfield"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBernie Casey.\n\n\tAt the end of \"The Maquis, Part II,\" Sisko surprisingly (?) lets his old friend go free, even though Hudson is a traitor, and Sisko DOES have a chance to apprehend him.  Years later, Maquis leader Michael Eddington (Kenneth Marshall) informs Sisko that Hudson died in battle, and Sisko takes a moment to mourn his lost friend. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Wire,\" we learn that a familiar character is suffering from life-threatening health problems because of an implant that, years earlier, was placed into his skull.  Which character is a victim of the titular \"wire\"?", "correct": "Garak", "options": ["Quark", "Bashir", "O'Brien"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarak.\n\n\tGarak, a spy years before the events of \"DS9,\" was at one time fitted with an odd implant that increased his endorphin (a pain-reducing neurotransmitter) levels markedly upon command.  The purpose of the device was to allow Garak to override his pain receptors and make any potential torture less effective...but Garak had been using it almost recreationally for quite some time, which resulted in a number of major health problems for him. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Crossover,\" the \"mirror universe\" first discovered by Captain Kirk and company in the original series episode \"Mirror, Mirror\" is finally revisited.

Yuck. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Collaborator,\" much is made of the fact that certain high-ranking officials in Bajoran political and religious circles collaborated with the Cardassians during the occupation of Bajor.  Kira, after having been asked to investigate the identity of the Bajoran collaborator who years ago gave the Cardassians the location of a group of freedom fighters (all of whom were subsequently killed), discovers evidence implicating her lover, Vedek Bareil, as the collaborator in question.  True or False: Bareil was NOT actually the collaborator.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt's revealed that the late Kai Opaka (Bajor's beloved religious leader who was killed, more or less, in season one) was the collaborator, and that Bareil had altered the evidence to \"cover\" for her in order to preserve her treasured memory in the eyes of Bajoran citizens.  That was a noble endeavor, but because of this choice, Bareil was forced to step down as a candidate for kai...handing the dangerous Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher) an easy victory. \n"}, {"text": "Chief O'Brien is abducted to Cardassia Prime and tried for a crime he did not commit in \"Tribunal.\"  According to Cardassian law, an accused criminal is allowed to have a \"nestor,\" or legal advisor, at the proceedings, and one of O'Brien's colleagues agrees to act in this capacity.

Sisko's father was mentioned a couple of times in the first two seasons -- and oddly, most of those references strongly suggested (thanks to the use of past tense verbs) that the elder Sisko was dead! -- but we didn't actually SEE Joseph Sisko until the fourth season (\"Homefront\"). \n"}]}
