{"id": "397030", "name": "Avengers: Age of Ultron Multiple Choice Quiz | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", " The Avengers"], "questions": [{"text": "Where is Loki's sceptre ultimately located?", "correct": "Sokovia", "options": ["Wakanda", "South Ossetia", "Narobia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSokovia.\n\n\tIn Sokovia, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, siblings who've been experimented on by Hydra, hide away while The Avengers infiltrate the facility they've been stowed away inside.  The base, guarded by a strong energy shield, also happens to be the place where Loki's sceptre has been stored away.  Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the leader of the base, plans to surrender since his test subjects are not yet ready, but it appears that they've already vanished. The truth is, Pietro, with his super-speed, has already headed out to the forest to toy with the Avengers.  His antics get Hawkeye shot by a bunker, so Black Widow calms down the Hulk and calls for an evacuation for him while the others head in.  Iron Man gets inside first, using J.A.R.V.I.S. to download all of the Hydra base's info before locating a secret door and descending the staircase inside. What he finds is a Chitauri ship and, sure enough, Loki's sceptre, but Wanda Maximoff gets to him first, using her powers to influence his mind, convincing him of a vision in which he sees not only the ship come to life, but all of the Avengers dead before him.  Realizing that he needs to do more to save them, he wields one of his gauntlets and grabs the sceptre while Pietro and Wanda watch on. \n"}, {"text": "Who joins Tony in upgrading the Iron Legion program with the Ultron AI?", "correct": "Bruce Banner", "options": ["Thor", "Steve Rogers", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBruce Banner.\n\n\tTending to Clint on the way back, The Avengers celebrate their victory aboard their flight.  Natasha and Bruce Banner both find solace in the fact that their 'lullaby' worked to pacify the Hulk while Tony tells J.A.R.V.I.S. to take the wheel.  He also states that Dr. Cho will be setting herself up in Bruce's lab back home to tend to Clint when the time comes.  Loki is thrilled to, finally, have Loki's staff to return to Asgard, but Tony wants to give it the once-over back at the Avengers' headquarters, formerly Stark Tower, in New York City.\rWhen they arrive, Clint is taken in for surgery while Maria Hill takes stock.  She informs Cap that Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are now in their systems, but they've gone missing.  They both agree they'll probably show up again.\rTony's AI-enhanced suits, the Iron Legion, return to the base for repairs while Tony and Bruce join J.A.R.V.I.S. in reviewing the sceptre.  The jewel, as J.A.R.V.I.S. finds, is very powerful and contains something of great interest.  Further investigation shows that the technology inside is severely advanced in the way of robotics work.  Both agree that it could be the key to creating Ultron, enhancing the Iron Legion protocol.  Tony wants to update within the next three days, and without telling the others, because it could protect the world in ways they never could've imagined.  Tony, heading to a party, leaves J.A.R.V.I.S. to continue work on the project, and when he does, the integration seems to be successful.    No one is around when Ultron regains sentience, reviews the history of Earth, and takes over J.A.R.V.I.S. in the lab, destroying his defences. \n"}, {"text": "During the party, when the other Avengers test their mettle at lifting Thor's hammer, how many are able to do so?", "correct": "None", "options": ["Three", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone.\n\n\tThe Avengers celebrate at a massive party in the HQ tower with their colleagues, mingling, telling jokes, and thinking about their futures with the initiative.  After taking turns trying to lift Thor's hammer (all of them failing to do so), they're interrupted by one of Tony's Iron Legion suits as it stumbles from the hallway and announces its plan to eradicate.  It unleashes the rest of the legion, now under its control, and absconds with Loki's sceptre while the Avengers are distracted.  In Sokovia, Hydra's labs reawaken.\rThe trail goes cold as soon as the sceptre is taken, and the other Avengers are quick to blame Tony for everything that's occurred.  He claims that he had to do something because of the otherworldly forces that have already attacked.  Cap, however, believes that they can face their enemies together instead of with Ultron or something like it.\rIn Sokovia, the Maximoffs find Ultron inside a city church.  Wanda, who asks if he came to save the world, realizes she can't read his mind because he is not human.  Ultron suggests that he is there for exactly that reason.  Taking the siblings back to the lab, he convinces them to assist him in fuelling his army.  They agree, believing Tony Stark to be directly responsible for their parents' death by his weapons. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these materials is said to be harvested from Wakanda?", "correct": "Vibranium", "options": ["Unobtainium", "Plutonium", "Adamantium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVibranium.\n\n\tWord gets to the Avengers that the Maximoffs have not only partnered with Ultron in Sokovia, but they've killed Baron von Strucker.  The group of them dig into the physical records in Avenger HQ when they find that their records have been erased, and they come across an interesting thread in Ulysses Klaue, a Dutch-born arms dealer who seems to have links to the nation of Wakanda and their source of Vibranium, the strongest metal in the world, used in Captain America's shield.\rAt a shipping salvage yard on the South African Coast, Klaue is met by the Maximoffs but refuses to give any information to them.  When Ultron steps in to coerce him, however, he opens the vault to his vibranium stores and transfers more than a billion dollars to Klaue's accounts.\rFortunately, that's when the Avengers arrive. \n"}, {"text": "Who is not affected by Wanda Maximoff's mind control during the mission in South Africa?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["The Hulk", "Thor", "Black Widow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tWhile the Avengers close in on Ultron and the Maximoffs, a fight begins.  Tony battles Ultron out of the ship while the others face off against Klaue's men and the Maximoffs inside.  Although the Avengers successfully subdue the lackeys, Wanda and Pietro are able to use their powers to take out the other Avengers in their own ways.  Only Hawkeye is able to avoid having his mind controlled by Wanda, ironically (because his mind was controlled during the events in New York), and he forces the Maximoffs to rush off.  The others aren't so lucky.\rThor hallucinates that he has entered a party on Asgard, though he's aware that Wanda performed her tricks on him; Heimdall urges him to wake up or, else, he may destroy all of Asgard.  Black Widow descends a staircase and finds herself in the academy where she was trained as an assassin; she fears her repeated failure.  Captain America emerges at a V-Day party in the 1940s and Peggy Carter asks him for their proposed dance.\rOutside, Wanda recovers from Hawkeye's attack and closes in on Bruce Banner, compelling him to transform into the Hulk and charge into Johannesburg.\rBesides Clint, there's no one to help; Tony blasts Ultron's current iteration and calls in a satellite-powered device to trap the Hulk but it doesn't work well enough to contain him.  It does, however, give him enough time to don stronger armor and bring down his fellow Avenger...after a devastating, building-razing battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these best describes Clint's safe house?", "correct": "A farmstead", "options": ["A bunker", "An apartment", "An abandoned mall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA farmstead.\n\n\tThe Avengers, finally back together again, fly out of South Africa in a bit of a rough mood.  Maria Hill advises the team not to return to New York City considering the damage.  Clint flies them to a safe house, his own family home, and has them all stay low, but Thor departs immediately, having been compelled by his vision.  Clint's wife speaks to him privately, seeking assurance that he believes the others have his back.  With another baby on the way, she doesn't want to be without him.  As she feels his side, she immediately notices his replacement skin, generated by Dr. Cho.\rIn Seoul, South Korea, Dr. Cho works in the U-Gin Genetics Research Lab, continuing her experiments on synthetic tissue.  Ultron is already there, however, and with Loki's sceptre and vibranium in-hand, it takes little compelling to ask her to make him a new body with her expertise. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Thor contact for help in London?", "correct": "Dr. Selvig", "options": ["Jane", "Darcy", "Odin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Selvig\n\n\tTalking with one another, Bruce argues to Natasha that no matter where he goes, he will be dangerous.  Natasha opens up to him about her past, suggesting that she's been damaged by her training, and she believes that they can disappear together.  Outside, Steve and Tony chop wood and theorize about Ultron and the Maximoffs, but their talk soon devolves into an argument.  Tony is only pulled from it when Clint's wife asks him to look at their trailer.  In truth, she just does so so he can speak, alone, to Nick Fury, who's arrived to chastise Stark for his actions with AI.  Fury, no longer the director of anyone considering the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. and his apparent death, can't convince Stark to do anything, but he does suggest that perhaps Wanda has gotten into his head, providing the image of a future that doesn't exist unless he lets his fears take over.  Later, when speaking to the rest of the group, Fury reveals that someone has been working against Ultron without being a part of the team, somehow manipulating the world's nuclear launch codes to prevent them from being used.  That said, they still need to stand together to prevent global destruction.\rThor, meanwhile, ends up at the University of London and speaks to Dr. Erik Selvig, requiring his help once again.\rIn South Korea, Helen Cho's work proves to be a major scientific breakthrough.  The vibranium cells bind with her synthetic tissues, creating the most versatile substance on the planet.  Breaking open the gem on Loki's sceptre, he reveals a single stone and places it onto the head of Cho's creation. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is stolen from Ultron, prolonging his integration as a result?", "correct": "The cradle", "options": ["The rebuilder", "The cube", "The nexus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe cradle.\n\n\tThe Avengers split up, departing from Clint's house that night.  Thor and Selvig, however, head to the Water of Sights where, if Thor is accepted by the Spirits, he can revisit his visions.  He succeeds and, in doing so, witnesses clues that reveal the Infinity Stones of the universe.  \rIn Oslo, Norway, Stark visits the NEXUS Internet hub to determine who is controlling the nuclear codes and seek out their ally.\rIn South Korea, Wanda and Pietro arrive to find Ultron being uploaded into his new body and, interestingly, Wanda can read his mind as though he were dreaming.  When she peers in for a closer look, she has a vision of a cataclysmic event, finally discovering Ultron's true goal of destroying humanity.  As the Avengers close in, Ultron attacks the scientists working on him and leaves without receiving his complete upload.  Dr. Cho warns Captain America of the gem, fearing its power to be too immense.\rCap dives into battle on the South Korean freeway, swooping in to fight Ultron while Hawkeye and Black Widow support from the air and the street.  While Cap distracts Ultron, Natasha makes it onto his vehicle and attempts to take control of his cradle device.  The attempt is successful; she gets it into the jet, but she's grabbed by one of Ultron's forces and pulled away.  Hawkeye has no choice but to go on without her to get the device back to Stark.\rOn the ground, Cap fights with Ultron on a train and finds unlikely support from the Maximoffs.  As the train derails at the end of the line, the siblings are able to bring it to a stop and save everyone in its path.  When all is said and done, Wanda warns Cap not to give the cradle device to Stark since he shares a common trait with Ultron-- he doesn't see a difference between saving the world and destroying it.\rUltron brings Natasha back to Sokovia where, assembling his robots, he locks her away and grows stronger.  From her cell, she's barely able to get a signal out, communicating in morse code and attracting Hawkeye's attention. \n"}, {"text": "Who or what is created using the Mind Stone and J.A.R.V.I.S.' consciousness?", "correct": "Vision & The Vision", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVision & The Vision.\n\n\tHawkeye brings the cradle back to Stark at Avengers HQ and it takes little time before Stark's mind starts working on a plan.  This time, he confides in Banner that he found the other party working within the internet, and it turns out, it was J.A.R.V.I.S., who was not destroyed by Ultron, but who broke away into the web.  His plan is to get Jarvis into the cradle and create something that knows how to kill Ultron once and for all.  The catch is that it's just as risky as their original Ultron plan.  Fearing that their backs are against the wall, Stark and Banner go ahead with the upload.\rSteve returns to the HQ with the Maximoffs in tow and, fearing the worse, they act to stop the project from going ahead.  Pietro disconnects the machine, but Hawkeye brings him down.  Cap and Tony face off against one another while Banner and Wanda pull each other away.  It all stops, however, when Thor returns from his solo trip, charging Mjolnir and using it to overpower the cradle and bring its contents to life.\rIt works.  The form inside-- what Ultron created-- rises from within, empowered by the Infinity Stone in its brow.  Thor, seeing this power in his vision, states that it can be the key to defeating Ultron, and thus, this Vision, with J.A.R.V.I.S.' mind and capabilities, is something else.  The Avengers worry that this Vision is not on their side, but the Vision believes in the side of life, where Ultron doesn't.  He does believe they need to stop Ultron though, and as he hands Thor the Mjolnir, he turns to leave. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives their life to protect another Avenger during the final battle?", "correct": "Pietro Maximoff", "options": ["Wanda Maximoff", "Natasha Romanoff", "Bruce Banner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPietro Maximoff.\n\n\tThe Avengers prepare themselves for battle, knowing that they must destroy every one of Ultron's legion, and they fly to Sokovia.  The Maximoffs evacuate the city while the others infiltrate Ultron's labs.  Bruce rescues Natasha from her cell and urges her to come with him since transforming into the Hulk would put everyone at risk.  Stark finds Ultron in the church in the center of the city as their foe's true plan finally comes into play.  Though Vision is able to swoop in and remove Ultron's access to the internet, burning him out with his powers, Ultron activates the remaining vibranium stock which he's formed into a device that splits Sokovia's capital from the surrounding land and lifts it into the sky.  His plan is to push it into the sky and drop it back to Earth, creating a meteor to wipe out humanity once and for all.\rThe Avengers, still in the city, do their best to protect its citizens but the time has to come for them to bring an end to the battle.  As the city ascends into the sky, Nick Fury finally arrives, bringing reinforcements to evacuate Sokovia via an old S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.  The Avengers assist in the effort and they find themselves surrounded at the drill, but they fight together, whittling their way through Ultron's forces until the last ones are picked off trying to escape Sokovia.  Wanda stays to protect the core while Natasha chases after the Hulk, attempting to use their lullaby but failing to calm him.  He drops her off on the Helicarrier and leaps on to Ultron's escaping ship, tossing him back to the ground.  Hawkeye, spying a last straggler, goes to save him but nearly gets shot and killed by Ultron's last body.  He is saved in the end by Pietro who, rushing forward, blocks all of the shots with his body.  Wanda, enraged when she senses her brother's death, finds Ultron's body and tears its heart from its chest.  She doesn't realize that there's still a robot in the church as it activates the drill.\rThere's no time to waste.  Tony heads to the bottom of the city to attack from beneath while Thor, in the church, strikes the top of the drill with Mjolnir.  Their blows shatter the drill and the evacuated city as Wanda is lifted away by Vision.  Sokovia breaks apart before it can hit the Earth, saving the planet from utter annihilation.\rBruce, worried about his inability to control himself, flies off on his own.  On the surface, Vision ends the mission by killing the last Ultron copy with the Mind Stone.\rClint returns home to his family, retiring from The Avengers.\rStark heads to the New Avengers Facility in Upstate New York a short time later.  There, Nick Fury informs Natasha that they may have found Bruce's jet, but can't figure out exactly where he is quite yet.  Thor informs the others that Vision should keep the Mind Stone as it's safest with him, but the appearance of four Infinity Stones in only a few years points to something beyond coincidence.  The Bifr\u00f6st pulls Thor back to Asgard while Stark goes his own way.  Rogers and Romanoff work together to train the next fleet of Avengers. \n"}]}
