The game is similar to air hockey, but instead of making a puck into a goal on the other side, you must get all eight discs on the other player's side.  What video game is this?", "correct": "Beyond Good and Evil", "options": ["Green With Envy", "De Ja Vu", "Call of Duty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeyond Good and Evil.\n\n\tJade is the main character of \"Beyond Good and Evil\".  She works for the IRIS Network.  Their mission is to stop the Alpha Sections from taking over the planet Hillys using the DomZ creatures.  The Alpha Sections pretend they are the good guys, and that IRIS is evil.  IRIS' goal is to stop the Alpha Sections evil plot.  The game was released in 2003 for the PC, Gamecube, PS2, and XBox. \n"}, {"text": "I love \"Spyro\" games.  One of the many \"Spyro\" games involves games that Spyro can play near the end.  In which \"Spyro\" game can Spyro play carnival games after he has defeated the main bad guy and earned enough orbs to open the final portal?", "correct": "Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage", "options": ["Spyro: A Hero's Tail", "Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly", "Spyro: Year of the Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro 2: Ripto's Rage.\n\n\t\"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage\" was released for the PS1 in 1999, and was the second in the \"Spyro\" series.  In this game, Spyro must collect orbs to power up a portal to get to Dragon Shores.  He was originally supposed to go there for vacation, but the Professer brought him to Avalar to defeat Ripto.  Spyro didn't feel like saving Avalar from Ripto, but because he was not able to get to Dragon Shores until he defeated Ripto, he began his quest. Once Ripto was defeated, and enough orbs were collected, Spyro was able to get to Dragon Shores.  Here he could play all sorts of carnival games and even watch little movies at the theater. Once the game was completed 100%, Spyro could also get the ultimate fire breath.  However, since the game was already completed 100% of the way through, ultimate fire breath doesn't do much unless you plan on playing some of the levels again just for fun. \n"}, {"text": "There is an online game for children.  In here you can find pins, dress up your cool home, and earn coins by playing all sorts of games.  These games include arcade games like \"Break the Ice\".  You can also play board games, like mancala.  What children's game is this?", "correct": "Club Penguin", "options": ["Millsbury", "Toon Town", "Wizards101"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClub Penguin.\n\n\t\"Club Penguin\" was first open to all in October of 2005.  You can play for free, but without buying a membership, you cannot buy fancy clothes or anything for your igloo.  As a free member, you can hope for items you can get for free from a box for a party or some other special event.  Players can play many mini-games in \"Club Penguin\".  You can race through a mineshaft in a mine cart, unload coffee beans, and even play games like mancala and Connect 4! \n"}, {"text": "Countless video games involve hacking computers at some point in time to gain access to loads of information from the bad guy.  One such video game has Bentley hacking computers quite often.  To hack the computer, one must shoot down a bunch of little virtual ships with his virtual ship, and get through red barriers to unlock codes and such.  In one such instance, the codes were used to speed up a train to free someone from a jail.  This hacking mini-game can also be played with two players.  What video game is this?", "correct": "Sly 3", "options": ["Sly 1", "Sly 2", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSly 3.\n\n\tWhile \"Sly 2\" does have Bentley hacking computers, this is not the answer.  \"Sly 3\" has Bentley accessing codes to speed up the train, the other two games do not, and only on \"Sly 3\" can two players play the hacking game.  \"Sly 1\" doesn't even have Bentley hacking computers.  \"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\" was released in 2002.  \"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\" was released in 2004, and in 2005 \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\" was released.  All were for the PS2. \n"}, {"text": "There is a game with flying question marks.  Ok, so there are platforms with question marks that float to bonus levels.  If you get all the boxes in the bonus, you will be able to get a lot of wumpas and even a gem at the end of the level if you collect all the boxes in both the bonus AND the main part of the level.  What series am I talking about?", "correct": "Crash Bandicoot", "options": ["James Bond", "Tak", "Tomb Raider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrash Bandicoot.\n\n\tCrash Bandicoot is an orange bandicoot named Crash (bet you didn't see that coming).  He doesn't talk, and he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  But he does save the world on countless occassions from his creator, Dr. Neo Cortex.  The release date for the first \"Crash Bandicoot\" game was 1996, and was the PS1.  Several more \"Crash\" games have been made since then, some on the PS1, some on the PS2, the Wii, the XBox, the Nintendo DS, etc. \n"}, {"text": "I have another \"Spyro\" question up my sleeve.  \"Spyro\" games have a lot of minigames.  Some games have portals with levels in them, and some have portals with little minigames in them.  Which of these, though, do we find Blink the Mole minigames?", "correct": "Spyro: A Hero's Tail", "options": ["Spyro: Year of the Dragon", "Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly", "Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro: A Hero's Tail.\n\n\t\"Spyro: A Hero's Tail\" was released in 2004 for the PS2, XBox, and Gamecube.  This game is different from the older games because there are no more portals to access levels.  Too, there is no specific amount of gems to collect.  However, you can still charge, as this game is not like the newer games where, instead of charging, you have a melee attack.  Minigames include shooter games, with Spyro, two levels with Hunter, several minigames with Sparx and Sgt. Byrd, and many minigame levels with the newest character, Blink the Mole, who is the Professor's nephew. \n"}, {"text": "In this game, there are a lot of different games Sora can play.  Each time he goes to a new world, there are new games to play, and some of the same games from previous levels.  Some of these minigames are side quests, like collecting Dalmatians.  What game is this?", "correct": "Kingdom Hearts", "options": ["Tak and the Power of Juju", "Final Fantasy", "Stolen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKingdom Hearts.\n\n\t\"Kingdom Hearts\" was released for the PS2 in 2002.  The sequel is \"Kingdom Hearts II\", also for the PS2, although there is a game called \"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories\" that takes place in between the two games.  In Kingdom Hearts, you can search for all 99 dalmatian puppies, three in each box, throughout all the worlds. For each certain amount of puppies found, Pongo and Perdita will reward you.  You can also search for mushrooms, and earn ranks and spells based on how you defeat them.  Other minigames include the \"Jungle Slider\" from \"Deep Jungle\", along with vine swinging, games in the \"Hundred Acre Wood\", and tournaments in the \"Olympus Coliseum\".  You can also talk to Merlin in his home and play around and practice your magic just for fun, without wasting any magic power. \n"}, {"text": "In the \"Complete Saga\" of this video game, you can play the game as one player or two.  The game consists of a total of 36 levels, each with 10 minikits, 10 blue minikits, and a red block.  You can also play bonus games at the end of each major level, after playing the six levels within that level.  There are also missions to save characters using a certain type of character, and there are also some two player head to head games you can play.  What game might I be describing?", "correct": "Lego Star Wars", "options": ["Lego Indiana Jones", "Lego Batman", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLego Star Wars.\n\n\t\"Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga\" combined the first and second games into one, added some levels and features, improved the create-a-character concept, and generally made the two games better.  It was released for the Nintendo DS, Wii, PS3, and XBox 360 in 2007.  There are a total of six major levels, which follow the story of the two \"Star Wars\" trilogies. Within each of these six major levels, there are six mini-levels that one can play.  The similarity of the game's story to that of the movies are pretty similar, so if you don't want to spoil the movie, don't play the game!  Bounty hunters have secret missions to save several characters in the game, and you can play them once you have unlocked and bought all the bounty hunters. If you go to the bonus room and watch a trailer, you can buy Indiana Jones, too! \n"}, {"text": "A certain game takes place in ancient Egypt.  The enemies are Horus, the main characters once ally, and Akhenaten, Tutankhamen's brother.  Tutankhamen is turned into a mummy, and when the main character finds canopic vases, you can play as the mummy.  There is a sidequest you can complete in this game, too.  You can capture rare animals, or buy some, and give them to the museum to extend their collection.  What game might this be?", "correct": "Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy", "options": ["Rogue Galaxy", "Prince of Persia", "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSphinx and the Cursed Mummy.\n\n\t\"Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy\", which is sometimes just called \"Sphinx\", was released in 2003 in some areas, and 2004 in others.  A mobile version was released in 2004 as well.  The consoles the game was released for are the PS2, XBox, and Gamecube.  Sphinx must save a bunch of Egyptian citizens during his quest that Anubis has sent him on.  They have turned into stone, and certain keys and items free them. Capturing animals requires a certain type of blue beetle, which, when dropped on the floor, can be maneuvered on the ground to an animal, thus catching it.  Be careful, though, as some of the animals you can capture attack you as you try to do so! \n"}, {"text": "In this game, there are five levels in each \"world\", followed by a boss battle.  Some levels are on land, some are underwater, and some are races on motorcycles.  In quite a number of these levels, you can collect all sorts of different crystals, some only accessed by finding the secret minigame of the level.  One of these minigames is accessed by crashing into the alien street sign with your motorcycle.  What video game might this be?", "correct": "Crash Bandicoot: Warped", "options": ["Crash Twinsanity", "Crash: Wrath of Cortex", "Crash Nitro Kart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrash Bandicoot: Warped.\n\n\t\"Crash Bandicoot: Warped\" is the third in the series, and it was released in 1998.  Minigames include a section of the level accessed from a platform and other secret locations.  Crash's sister, Coco, also appears in this game, riding on her pet tiger in several levels.  In other levels, Crash rides a dinosaur!  Well, a baby dinosaur, but it is still large enough for him to ride. \n"}]}
