Now Spyro had even more friends that would help him along his quest.  Each of these could be found in specific levels, and would have their own level.  What are these levels known as?", "correct": "Minigames", "options": ["Levels", "Portals", "Worlds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinigames.\n\n\tThese minigames would be found in certain levels, accessed by portals, in different worlds.  The minigame characters that could be played include Sgt. James Byrd, Bentley, Sheila, and Agent 9.  Each has their own special power that they can use to advance through the levels that Spyro could otherwise not do.  Sgt. Byrd can fly, so he can reach high levels, and he launches missiles and drops bombs. Bentley is strong, so he can smash rocks, but he isn't a very good jumper.  Sheila is a terrific jumper, and can smash things on the ground much easier.  Agent 9 is quick, and he can move from side to side and attack using his laSer gun. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage\", Spyro must collect something special to power up a portal that the Professor, Hunter, Elora, and Spyro were testing out.  Elora had originally removed these so Ripto could no longer use the portal.  What item does Spyro need to collect in order to use the portal?", "correct": "Orbs", "options": ["Eggs", "Gems", "Dragonflies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrbs.\n\n\tDragonflies are only collected in \"Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly.\"  Gems are collected in most games, but are more like money than main collectibles.  Eggs are collected in a lot of the Spyro games.  For instance, in one game, a dragonsitter has lost eighty eggs, and Spyro must find them.  In the first game, Spyro chases and attacks thieves to collect pink eggs.  However, in the second game, orbs are just as important as eggs.  You can find orbs by performing side quests or locating them in secret places. \n"}, {"text": "What are Bianca, Cynder, and Ripto to Spyro?", "correct": "Nemesis", "options": ["Girls", "Friends", "Dragons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNemesis.\n\n\tThe three listed are all enemies of Spyro, although both Bianca and Cynder become friends with Spyro and help him along his journey.

Sheila is a kangaroo, and has never had a crush on Spyro.  While Cynder does admit to loving Spyro, she was never in the original series.  She was a main enemy turned friend in the \"Legend of Spyro\" series.  Ember is a pink dragon.  In \"A Hero's Tale\", you can even play her, or make Spyro black, blue, or red. \n"}, {"text": "In a couple of the original Spyro games, a character by the name of Bentley, shows up.  What kind of creature is he?", "correct": "Yeti", "options": ["Dragon", "Bigfoot", "Rancor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYeti.\n\n\tBentley is a yeti.  He has a younger brother named Bartholomew.

Spyro becomes flustered, and Blink tells him he was just kidding, that the Professor is his uncle. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage,\" Ripto has invaded a new world.

In a few games, Sparx plays his own levels, and when you take damage, Sparx will take a hit instead of you.  Of course, if he is gone, you will die if you take damage.
