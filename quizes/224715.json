Understanding its source may be important to understanding his devious psychology! You think back and recall that a faded billboard sign featuring a pair of disembodied, bespectacled eyes is a prominent symbolic element in what classic American novel?", "correct": "\"The Great Gatsby\", by F. Scott Fitzgerald", "options": ["\"Elmer Gantry\", by Sinclair Lewis", "\"Tortilla Flat\", by John Steinbeck", "\"An American Tragedy\", by Theodore Dreiser"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\", by F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\tSkulking up the mansion's driveway, you recall the voice of jouen58 as he explained the motif's significance over a meal: \"Nick Carraway, the narrator, describes the billboard near the beginning of Chapter II: 'The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic- their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.' The sign, once posted by an optician, overlooks the dismal Queens neighborhood where Myrtle Wilson, mistress of Carraway's friend Tom Buchanan, lives with her ineffectual husband George, a car mechanic. It also bears silent, sightless witness to Myrtle's tragic death in a hit-and-run accident. After her death, Wilson points out the sign to his friend Michaelis and solemnly declares 'God sees everything'. Michaelis deflatingly replies 'That's an advertisement'.\r \"Some have speculated that the sign represents the all-seeing eyes of God, but the exchange between Wilson and Michaelis indicates that Fitzgerald's God is a disinterested one at best. Certainly, there is no divine justice in the novel's denouement: a distraught Wilson forces Tom at gunpoint to name the owner of the death car. Tom names Gatsby, neglecting to mention that his wife Daisy was actually the driver. Wilson shoots Gatsby, then turns the gun on himself; the reprehensible Buchanans, who are jointly responsible for the three deaths, entirely escape the consequences of their actions.\r \"Incidentally, the original cover art for 'The Great Gatsby' also features a disembodied pair of eyes -and lips- staring mournfully over a brightly-lit Coney Island carnival. The eyes belong to Daisy; a single green teardrop (or is it a firework?) falls from one of them. The cover was by artist Francis Cugat (brother of bandleader Xavier Cugat) and may actually have suggested the symbolic element featured in the novel.\" \n"}, {"text": "You're lurking outside, wondering how best to get in, when a deliveryman approaches and rings the doorbell. The tune seems eerily familiar, and then you realize where you've heard it before. In 1982, \"Rocky III\" was released with this #1 hit song as part of its soundtrack. What was the title of Survivor's biggest hit?", "correct": "Eye of the Tiger", "options": ["For Your Eyes Only", "Eyes on the Prize", "In Your Eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEye of the Tiger.\n\n\t\"Eye of the Tiger\" spent six weeks at Billboard's number one. Though Survivor had some other hits, they didn't survive very long, breaking up in 1989.\r You've listened to the hit song with ertrum a hundred times at least at Headquarters, and you're humming the tune under your breath as you take advantage of the deliveryman's diversion to slip in through a window. \n"}, {"text": "In the front hallway you find a bust of Mary Ingalls. Could her life offer a clue to the ultimate plans of Guildeneye? You think back to what you know (or don't know!) about her:\n\nThe series of books by Laura Ingalls Wilder became a long-running television series called, of course, \"Little House On The Prairie\". The Ingalls family, as they built their home and life in the rugged upper Midwest post U.S. Civil War, encountered many a challenge as they prospered. As per the TV show (and historical entertainment is rather famous for taking many freedoms with facts) one travail was that the oldest daughter, Mary Ingalls, tragically lost her eyesight as a teenager. THAT is true in the midst of lots of other licenses taken with the history that really happened. Aside from that, which of the following observations is factual about the blind [but less remembered] Mary Ingalls?", "correct": "She never married, never had children and never ran a school for the blind.", "options": ["Oh, those intrepid liars! Mary Ingalls was born with next to no vision and the total blindness was expected and not a surprise at all!", "She did, in fact, marry Adam Kendall but their two children did not survive infancy.", "Mary DID become a teacher but not for children with any sort of impairment. She was the first sightless teacher in a public school system in South Dakota's history."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe never married, never had children and never ran a school for the blind.\n\n\t\"Mary Ingalls (1865 - 1928) suffered a stroke at the age of 14 and the damage eventually stole her vision completely,\" you remember Gatsby722 telling you as you discussed individuals most famous for their eyesight over a memorable pot of Turkish coffee one cold night. \"Before that time she was a normal, healthy girl.Her sister's books changed things a little, changing the stroke to scarlet fever; the show changed things a lot. They gave the character a dashing handsome husband, likewise blind (at least for a while), and they both became teachers at a school for non-seeing youngsters. That never happened in actuality.She did attend the Iowa School For The Blind in Vinton from the age of 16 until 24 but never was an educator nor did she ever marry. After completing her studies she returned home to live with her parents until their deaths at which time she lived with her sisters until she passed away in 1928. Clearly, her 'real' life would not have packed the dramatic punch that her TV one did. Miss Ingalls's true story would have been a little too depressing to view, I suppose.\" \n"}, {"text": "As you descend to the depths of the mansion, you discover the arch-optometrist's computer. You have a thumb drive to download his data, but you need the password. Luckily, a note from Guildeneye is taped to the monitor, containing a personal password hint: \"This structure is found in the eyes of many nocturnal animals, including cats and dogs, but only one ethnic group of humans possesses it.\" What's the password?", "correct": "Tapetum lucidum", "options": ["Optic fovea", "Macula lutea", "Choroid coat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTapetum lucidum.\n\n\tMotherGoose had explained it all back at Headquarters, when the receptionist was upset at the poor quality of her cat photos. \"The tapetum lucidum (Latin for \"bright carpet\") is a thin reflective membrane behind the retina that acts like a mirror,\" she explained, \"causing the eye to shine in the dark. It occurs in many nocturnal animals, notably cats and dogs.Its function is to enhance night vision. It only occurs in one group of humans - the Aboriginal people of Australia. The presence of the tapetum lucidum is the reason why it is almost impossible to get a decent flash photo of your cat or dog without the \"green\" or \"gold\" eye effect.When taking flash photographs of humans, the annoying \"red eye\" effect is caused by reflection of the blood vessels in the retina.\" \n"}, {"text": "You carefully make your way to Guildeneye's library, where the secret passage to his inner sanctum is supposedly located. Prominently displayed is a dictionary turned to the \"extol - eyeteeth\" page, and you can't resist glancing at it; you know that many etymologists would give their own eyeteeth to know how all the fuss over eyeteeth erupted. Which of the following do you find has been claimed regarding the etymology of \"eyeteeth\"?", "correct": "Because eyeteeth erupt with the coming of \"young adulthood\", the teeth represent wisdom.", "options": ["\"Eyeteeth\" was originally \"ayeteeth\". The original meaning of aye was \"always\". Therefore, giving up ones \"ayeteeth\" amounted to giving up all one's teeth.", "The smile of Norse chieftain Eystein Glumra Ivarrson the Noisy so dazzled his subjects that they coveted his teeth.", "The \"eye\" refers not to an anatomical eye, but rather, to \"eyet\", an old spelling for the arcane word \"eyot\", meaning \"island\" and hence referring to one's lone remaining tooth. The term was later wrongly pluralized."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause eyeteeth erupt with the coming of \"young adulthood\", the teeth represent wisdom.\n\n\tYou make a note to tell your findings to uglybird, who is fond of trading etymological speculations. \"One's eyeteeth are the canines directly under one's eyes,\" he once told you as you birdwatched together from the Headquarters roof, \"and, according to \"Randomhouse.com\", might have been considered symbolic of the wisdom that comes with young adulthood, a notion that parents of \"young adults\" might at times find difficult to credit.The other answers do include bits of factual information. \"Aye\" did perhaps derive from a word meaning always. \"Eyet\" is an alternative spelling for \"eyot\" and means \"island\". Finally, a real 9th century Norse Earl was named \"Eystein Glumra Ivarrson\". Eystein's subjects did (one hopes affectionately) refer to as \"The Noisy\". However, history does not record Eystein's subjects' opinion of his teeth.\" \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the library is a single shelf with four lonely books of Roman poetry. Remove the right book, and the wall will slide away to reveal the passage to Guildeneye's lair; the wrong book will lead to certain death. Naturally, after your prior experiences in this mansion, you guess that the favored poetry volume might hinge on eyes somehow. You dimly recall a first couplet that may point you to the correct book:\n\n\"Cynthia caught me with her eyes, poor me,\nNever before touched by any love.\"\n\nSo begins the work of which somewhat obscure Roman lyric poet?", "correct": "Propertius", "options": ["Catullus", "Horace", "Ovid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPropertius.\n\n\tThank goodness for the many hours you spent with pu2-ke-qi-ri at Headquarters, discussing classical poetry (and particularly its relation to geology). Propertius, you remember, is a rather difficult poet to read, thanks to his extensive (some would say excessive) use of mythological references. \r \"But still, some of his poetry is quite worth reading,\" pu2-ke-qi-ri insisted, \"because of his self-searching and introspective attitude towards his relationship with his lover, Cynthia. His poems are far too long to include in translation here, but let me close with Propertius' own words: \r 'For me it is right neither to love another nor to desist from this love.\rCynthia was the first, and Cynthia will be the last.'\"\r You remove the Propertius volume from the bookshelf, and the wall slides back to reveal a cramped passageway. \n"}, {"text": "You slide through the opening in the wall and into the secret passage. Unsurprisingly, it's booby-trapped: a bomb will go off unless you can insert an eye-related book into the correct spot in Guildeneye's science fiction collection. In the Expanded Universe (EU) of \"Star Wars\", where does the novel \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" fit into the storyline?", "correct": "Between \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\"", "options": ["Between \"Revenge of the Sith\" and \"A New Hope\"", "Between \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\"", "Between \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetween \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\n\tWhen the bomb doesn't explode, you breathe a sigh of relief and thank your lucky star \n"}, {"text": "As you pass through the corridor, another song - triggered by a motion detector? - begins to play. You find yourself singing along under your breath; you've always loved this one. This huge Kim Carnes hit from 1981 invited us to consider a woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. She's described as having hair of \"Harlow gold\", and \"Greta Garbo stand off sighs\", which made \"all the boys think she's a spy\". What star's name was used to describe her eyes?", "correct": "Bette Davis", "options": ["Tippi Hedren", "Katharine Hepburn", "Audrey Hepburn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette Davis.\n\n\tContinuing through the passageway, you remember what skunkee told you about this song when she found you listening to it at top volume while doing some training exercises at Headquarters. You'd told her that it was penned by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon, and that \"Bette Davis Eyes\" was arguably Kim Carnes's biggest hit, winning her the Grammy for Song of the Year. To your delight, skunkee informed you that Davis was reportedly thrilled with the song, and wrote to both Carnes and the songwriters, asking them how they had managed to nail her personality so well. \r \"Born on April 5, 1908, Davis had a long and exciting career in film,\" skunkee continued. \"She was nominated for an Oscar every year for five years in a row, winning only two of those nominations. She left us on October 6, 1989, succumbing to metastasized breast cancer.\" \n"}, {"text": "The secret passage opens out onto four doors, each marked with a word or a phrase. From other infiltrators, you know that three doors lead to inner sancta, while the fourth leads into an Indiana Jones-style pit of snakes. The door with the phrase not related to the eye is the door to avoid. You recall that, for obvious reasons, the eye as a symbol may be spied throughout history in world mythology, folklore and religious imagery. Which of the following does NOT use the eye in any particular way? ", "correct": "The peace symbol", "options": ["Boats", "The United States Government", "Hinduism and Buddhism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe peace symbol.\n\n\t\"As witness to the power of the eye,\" Bruyere once told you back at Headquarters, \"the origins of all of these symbols have generated many opinions and lately, websites. Some of them are controversial. Nevertheless the peace symbol does not use an eye. Some observers hark back to the Roman times and the sign as an upturned crucifix, therefore anti-Christian. Others, instead of the truly recent symbol created for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958, see it as the crow's foot or witch's foot symbol and therefore a threat. \r \"As to the eye symbols, boats in the Mediterranean and throughout Asia paint eyes on the prow of their craft to guarantee smooth sailing. The third eye of Shiva is legendary in Hindu imagery. Then what visitor to the Stupas in Buddhist countries can forget the all seeing eyes of Buddha? Judaism uses the Hand of Hamesh with an eye in the palm of the hand and others use this as well. Many of the cultures around the world feel the need to protect themselves from the evil eye, and the Mediterraneans and Middle Easterners have various methods. One of the notable ones is the blue jewelry in the form of eyes that many people wear. These customs date back to time eternal.\r \"Then, another eye symbol is the Egyptian's great eye of Horus on the Great Seal of the USA found on the one dollar bill atop a pyramid. This is yet another controversial symbol because of its association with Masonic symbols. Others see anti-Christian associations in this symbol. In any case, the eye is one of the most powerful symbols throughout world history.\"\r Making a mental note to thank Bruyere, and avoiding the door marked \"Peace symbol,\" you try a knob ... \n"}, {"text": "The second door that you try leads to a room with a world map on one wall and books strewn across a conference table. At last - the room where Guildeneye's evil plans are laid! Your sources have told you that his very wickedest plan is described in a memo concealed within a book of philosophy, penned by a famous gentleman code-named \"Soul-Seat.\" You see four philosophical tracts on the table, and you remember that esoteric spiritual tradition has long proclaimed that the \"Pineal Gland,\" which is located in the center of the human brain and directly behind the eyes, is in fact a \"third eye\" that enables one to see beyond the physical world and into the hidden realms beyond. Which philosopher coined the term \"Seat Of The Soul\" for this pea-sized mystery spot in the human brain?", "correct": "Rene Descartes", "options": ["John Mills", "Aristotle", "Pliny the Younger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRene Descartes.\n\n\tYou once had a long discussion about philosophy with gretas in some downtime between blues sets at Headquarters. \"French philosopher Rene Descartes is perhaps best known for the proclamation 'I think, therefore I am,'\" she told you. \"His interest in science and mathematics was equaled by his passion for spiritual study, which led him to a strong bias in favor of 'dualism.' In 1589, Queen Christina of Sweden invited the venerated thinker to her country, where shortly after his arrival, he died as a result of his low resistance to the cold.\"\r Cautiously, you slide the Descartes tract open and photograph Guildeneye's diabolical memo. Skimming quickly, you perceive the vileness of his plan: from a satellite in low-Earth orbit, he will perform laser eye surgery on every man, woman, and child on Earth, not to improve their vision but to worsen it. This way, he will ensure the success of his designer eyewear business. How dreadful! It's a good thing that you've got his plans and can now warn the world. Good work, Secret Agent! \n"}]}
