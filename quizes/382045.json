The next month Madison won the award, and John attributed her success to a rigged system. What psychological theory could explain John's behavior? ", "correct": "Self-serving bias", "options": ["Cognitive dissonance ", "Halo effect", "Reciprocity "], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelf-serving bias.\n\n\tThe self-serving bias could be used to explain John's behavior, because he attributed his own success to his strengths, and Madison's success to external factors, a rigged system.

Which phenomenon occurs when people are less likely to offer help when they are in a large group? ", "correct": "Bystander effect", "options": ["Defense mechanism ", "Social loafing  ", "Group cohesiveness "], "explanation": "\n\n\nBystander effect.\n\n\tThe bystander effect is often the reason that bullying goes unpunished, because no one wants to take responsibility.

Diffusion of responsibility occurs when a bystander does not help because they believe that someone else will. \n"}, {"text": "The highly controversial Milgram experiment of 1963 tested which form of compliance?", "correct": "Obedience", "options": ["Pressure  ", "Comorbidity ", "Obedience ", "Reinforcement "], "explanation": "\n\n\nObedience.\n\n\tThe Milgram experiment tested how far a participant would go to obey the commands of the experimenter. The participant would ask questions to another participant, who was actually a confederate of the experimenter. The confederate could not be seen and was not harmed in any way, but the participant believed they were administering them a shock for each incorrect answer. Many participants obeyed completely and delivered the highest shock setting, which would have killed the person. \n"}, {"text": "A baby cried when something was out of sight because he did not realize that it still existed somewhere else. What concept did this baby not understand? ", "correct": "Object permanence", "options": ["Conservation ", "Object permanence ", "Fast mapping", "Irreversibility "], "explanation": "\n\n\nObject permanence.\n\n\tChildren develop many skills as they grow older, including the ability to understand object permanence. Many infants do not realize that an object they can not see still exists, so when you take an object away they may cry and not look for it. Older children will realize that the object is still there but hidden. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these occurs when you like those who show that they like you?", "correct": "Reciprocity", "options": ["Attribution ", "Matching hypothesis ", "Reciprocity ", "Collectivism "], "explanation": "\n\n\nReciprocity.\n\n\tMany people say that opposites attract, but in reality it is the opposite.
