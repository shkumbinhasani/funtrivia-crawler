{"id": "353770", "name": "Horror Films of 2012 Quiz | Horror Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Horror Mixture", "Horror Movies by Year"], "questions": [{"text": "Starring Ethan Hawke as a troubled writer, what 2012 horror film featured a demon known as Bughuul?", "correct": "Sinister", "options": ["Terrifying", "Insidious", "Atrocious"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSinister.\n\n\tDirected by Scott Derrickson (also known for \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\"), \"Sinister\" starred Hawke as true crime writer Ellison Oswalt.  Moving into an alleged murder house with his unknowing family, he ended up unearthing a box of home videos in the attic and unleashing an ages-old curse.  As he struggled to write his new book he ended up putting his family in danger.\r\"Sinister\" was highly-praised by critics for its unflinching approach to horror.  Due to strong sound editing and fairly creepy sequences, it ended up successful in the box office earning $41,000,000 on a budget of $3,000,000. \n"}, {"text": "Katie and Robbie moved into a new house together in what 2012 horror sequel, released as a found-footage horror movie?", "correct": "Paranormal Activity 4", "options": ["The Grudge 4", "Rec 3: Genesis", "Piranha 3DD"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParanormal Activity 4.\n\n\tAnother in the series of found-footage films made on a pittance, \"Paranormal Activity 4\" added another $100,000,000 to the growing total generated by the series; the first, as many would recall, was the top-earning independent film ever made upon its release.  In this installment, the viewer picked up a few years after the events of the second film; Katie and Robbie (previously known as Hunter) moved into a new house and their neighbours filmed the weird occurrences (erm...I mean paranormal activities) as they went on.  The movie was produced by the original director, Oren Peli, while it was filmed by \"Catfish\" and \"Paranormal Activity 3\" directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost. \n"}, {"text": "2012 marked the release of the fifth film in the \"Resident Evil\" movie franchise, but which one of these was it?", "correct": "Resident Evil: Retribution", "options": ["Resident Evil: Afterlife", "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", "Resident Evil: Extinction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResident Evil: Retribution.\n\n\tAfter the fourth \"Resident Evil\" film was released in 2010 and made enough money to eclipse the previous movies (it earned almost $300,000,000), it only made sense to release the fifth in the series, \"Retribution\", which starred Milla Jovovich as Alice and featured several past cast members as cloned versions of themselves. This film brought the cast through different remade cities, fighting the zombie hordes in underground facilities managed by none other than the Umbrella Corporation.  In 3D, like the previous film, \"Retribution\" earned $220,000,000 overall.  It was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, Jovovich's husband and it became the most commercially-successful video game adaptation to date. \n"}, {"text": "Following up on the story of Alessa/Sharon, what 2012 sequel (in 3D) marked the return of Pyramid Head and a foggy town plagued by unnatural beings?", "correct": "Silent Hill: Revelation", "options": ["Final Destination 5", "Grave Encounters 2", "Scream 4"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilent Hill: Revelation.\n\n\tMade as a direct sequel to Christophe Gans' original, polarizing adaptation of the video game series \"Silent Hill\", \"Revelation\" brought some of the original actors back to the shadowy (and foggy) town to uncover the mysteries of the past.  In this film, a now-teenaged Sharon headed to the town to save her father (played by Sean Bean).  The film, of course, featured Pyramid Head and faceless, promiscuous nurses -- you know, like the game. Unfortunately, it was critically panned; while the first film was dense, like the games, the second was simply dull.  It still turned a profit in the box office, but opened low in its first weekend. \n"}, {"text": "Created by Joss Whedon, what not-so-typical horror film satirized the genre with metafiction and featured an evil merman?", "correct": "Cabin in the Woods", "options": ["Prometheus", "The Evil Dead", "Haywire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCabin in the Woods.\n\n\tAlthough the movie was filmed more than a year earlier than its April 2012 release, it languished on the shelves at Lionsgate until an appropriate time.  It was well-worth the wait; movie-goers and critics agreed that it was a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek horror flick.  The movie followed five friends on a trip to a cabin in the woods (sound familiar?) but the vacation didn't go as planned when they realized they were part of something much bigger than just themselves.  The movie earned over $65,000,000 despite the mess behind the scenes. \n"}, {"text": "Another Oren Peli production, what 2012 found-footage horror film, set in a nuclear fallout zone, was made on only a million dollars?", "correct": "Chernobyl Diaries", "options": ["The Divide", "John Dies at the End", "The Crazies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChernobyl Diaries.\n\n\tIn \"Chernobyl Diaries\", a group of friends took a guided tour to a restricted zone in Ukraine, specifically the nuclear fallout region in Chernobyl.  When their guide was killed and their transport sabotaged, they were forced to try and escape on their own.  Despite poor scores, the movie earned thirty-five times its original million dollar budget (as is the tendency of Oren Peli's movies.  The film was Bradley Parker's directorial debut, having worked in visual effects for several high-grossing films in the years before. \n"}, {"text": "What critically-panned horror film from 2012 ended with a link to a website where viewers could allegedly watch the end of the movie?", "correct": "The Devil Inside", "options": ["No One Lives", "V/H/S", "Maniac"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Devil Inside.\n\n\tReleased at the very beginning of January 2012 (a clear sign that the movie is being dumped by the studio), \"The Devil Inside\" was another found footage piece, this time following a woman heading to Europe to meet her mother.  As it turned out, her mother was possessed by several demons.  As she and her camera crew tried to uncover the truth they found that they were becoming entrenched in something demonic. Critics never got to see the movie before its release and audiences loathed it; it was determined by many that the film never had a final act -- after the credits, a link to a website suggested that more could be uncovered on the Internet. In its second week, it nearly broke a record for greatest drop in audience.  Go figure, it earned $100,000,000. \n"}, {"text": "\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe was the main actor in what 2012 film, based on a novel by Susan Hill?", "correct": "The Woman in Black", "options": ["Locke and Key", "Horns", "Let Me In"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Woman in Black.\n\n\tA ghost story written in 1983 by Susan Hill, \"The Woman in Black\" has been repeatedly adapted, but never with as high-profile a star.  Radcliffe starred as a damaged British lawyer who headed to an estate in a dreary marsh to run a work errand.  The trip proved difficult as local children kept dying in graphic ways. As the movie progressed he also found that he and his son were in danger of a mysterious, ghostly woman in black.  The movie, directed by British horror director James Watkins (known for \"Eden Lake\"), was financially successful, earning over $125,000,000.  It was also backed by the renowned horror production company Hammer Films, much like 2010's \"Let Me In\". \n"}, {"text": "The first film since \"The Unborn\" (2009) to feature a Dybbuk Box, what movie, released in 2012, starred Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick?", "correct": "The Possession", "options": ["The Apparition", "The Box", "The Pact"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Possession.\n\n\tIn this movie, a family, broken apart, dealt with their emotional wounds from a messy divorce.  When the husband, Clyde, took his daughters to a garage sale, one of them purchased a mysterious, alluring box.  Little did they all know, the box was possessed by a creature from Jewish folklore known as a Dybbuk. Although a number of critics disliked the film, it earned a fair bit of money (almost $75,000,000) to become a success.  Others claimed that the film was actually successful, especially considering the other exorcist/demon film released earlier on, \"The Devil Inside\", was such tripe.  The movie was produced by Sam Raimi and Ghost House Pictures. \n"}, {"text": "Although critically-panned, what 2012 horror movie, featuring \"Hunger Games\" star Jennifer Lawrence, involved a mother and daughter moving in next door to a house with a dark past (and present, as they discovered)?", "correct": "House at the End of the Street", "options": ["Dark Shadows", "American Mary", "Silent House"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse at the End of the Street.\n\n\t\"House at the End of the Street\" wasn't necessarily well-received upon its September release (especially considering the horror fare coming out before Halloween) but it did turn a profit three times greater than its $10,000,000 budget.  With the star power behind it, the movie ended up being critically panned and didn't last long before it was pulled from cinemas. Its British director, Mark Tonderai, has also made thrillers in his native UK.  In this film, Lawrence's character and her mother (portrayed by Elizabeth Shue) moved into a new house only to discover that the neighbours (except one son) had been murdered. Of course, it didn't end there; there was a deep, dark secret. \n"}]}
