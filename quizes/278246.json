", "correct": "Enoch and Elijah", "options": ["Eli and Edom", "Eliab and Ehud", "Elisha and Esau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnoch and Elijah.\n\n\tGenesis 5 says that Enoch had such a close relationship with God that he was taken to heaven without experiencing physical death. He was the father of Methuselah. Little more is said about this man.

", "correct": "Egypt", "options": ["Ethiopia", "Ephesus", "Ephraim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgypt.\n\n\tHerod the Great, concerned about the prophecies regarding the coming of a new king, ordered the murder of all boys under the age of two living in the vicinity of Bethlehem.  An angel of the Lord told Joseph to take his family and flee to Egypt (Matthew 2:11-18). \n"}, {"text": "Who was the Jewish Queen of Persia who was used by God to save his people from annihilation?", "correct": "Esther", "options": ["Eunice", "Eve", "Endora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsther.\n\n\tEsther was orphaned as a child and raised by her cousin Mordecai. She became queen after the king did away with the previous queen, Vashti, who refused his command to attend a party. Esther courageously but discreetly won the king's trust and eventually alerted him of a plot that would have destroyed her people.

When Jesus died, the Bible says that the \"earth shook\" (Matthew 27:51). Earthquakes were also connected to the resurrection of Jesus (Matthew 28:2), Elijah's sulking under a juniper tree (I Kings 19:11) and during Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16:31-33). \n"}, {"text": "What group joined Peter as he addressed the crowd on the Day of Pentecost after the ascension of Jesus?", "correct": "The Eleven", "options": ["The Elders", "The Essenes", "The Epicureans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Eleven.\n\n\tActs 2:14 says that \"Peter stood up with the Eleven\".
