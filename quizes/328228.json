Making their way down the halls, however, they are all ambushed with slushie facials, proving that nothing has really changed for any of them.\rWill, meanwhile, is called into Figgins' office to talk about the Glee Club.  This time, he states that they must place at Regionals, the next competition, to stay afloat.  While Will may have proven the validity of the club at Sectionals, the lights in the auditorium, as Figgins puts it, do not run on dreams.  In addition, the Cheerios need the auditorium to practice while it gets colder out.  Will comments that the Cheerios have no coach, but Sue walks in having been reinstated in the role.  Will is dumbfounded.\rFinn, in the meantime, has picked up on basketball as football season is now over.  Despite this, he's still distracted and somewhat depressed.  While he likes Rachel, he can't get over Quinn (who's having a hard enough time with Puck).  The truth is, he's confused. \n"}, {"text": "How did Sue get her job back at McKinley High?", "correct": "By blackmailing Principal Figgins", "options": ["By appealing to the school board", "By offering to oversee detention", "By paying for a new auditorium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy blackmailing Principal Figgins.\n\n\tWill finds Sue in the halls snipping a ponytail off one of the male students and he asks her how she got reinstated.  She explains that after careful thinking, she decided she was too harsh and decided to speak to Figgins over dinner.  Spiking his drink, Figgins awoke to find himself in bed with Sue in a seedy red-light district motel where Sue explained that if he didn't reinstate her, she would leak pictures to his wife and church.  Now, Sue's goal is to eliminate Glee Club and get rid of Will.\rIn rehearsal, Will suggests their topic for the week: 'Hello'.  New Directions needs a new greeting, and to do that he instructs the kids to find a song with the word 'Hello' in it and perform it for their assignment. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to perform during the episode?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Rachel", "Will", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tWill and Emma, fresh off their whirlwind embrace from the end of \"Sectionals\", talk in Emma's office (as her job had also been reinstated).  Before Will can kiss her again, however, her obsessive cleanliness kicks in once more and they have to stop.  Will decides to start things off right though; he invites her on a date- dinner at his place.\rSue, meanwhile, speaks with Brittany and Santana in her office informing them that they should be ashamed that they won Sectionals.  Brittany claims that they were distracted by the glitz and glamour of showbiz, but Sue sets them straight informing them that their new mission is to occupy Finn's time making Rachel jealous enough to leave New Directions for good.  This way, Will won't have a chance of keeping his Glee Club.\rFinn is in the auditorium trying to figure out his 'Hello' song with Mr. Schuester and attempting to figure out how to make himself less depressed and confused.  Will comments that he needs to find the new person inside him that gets him past who he once was.  To begin, he sings \"Hello, I Love You\" by The Doors, beginning in the auditorium and ending up in the rehearsal room.  After the song, when Rachel speaks with Mr. Schuester, Brittany and Santana decide to strike. \n"}, {"text": "Finn breaks up with Rachel before dating Brittany and Santana.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe girls work their magic and woo Finn into a date at Breadsticks for the three of them shortly before Rachel speaks with him.  Sensing something amiss, she comments that it's tough for the two of them to be together because of her personality, she's honest, sometimes brutally so, and she ask for the same courtesy in return.  Finn replies that he doesn't want to be her boyfriend; he wants to find who he really is first.  Rachel responds quickly stating that he's just scared to be with her because of her image and she actually knows him for who he really is.  Turning away, she cries to herself as she walks down the hallway before class.\rIn Glee Club, Rachel is the only one with a new number- one she feels sums up her emotions: \"Gives You Hell\" by The All-American Rejects\".  She sings the song, clearly directed at Finn, while the rest of the club backs her.  Mr. Schuester is angry with this display as the assignment involved the word 'Hello'.  Rachel claims she only focused on the first syllable. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Rachel meet Jesse?", "correct": "The library", "options": ["At school", "Sectionals (in the previous episode)", "At a theatre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe library.\n\n\tRealizing that their new number is more serious due to the strength of Vocal Adrenaline's team, Rachel heads to the library to find a new 'Hello' song to perform and perfect for the team.  Picking up a songbook dedicated to Lionel Richie, she is interrupted in her search by the lead member of rival team Vocal Adrenaline, Jesse St. James. He compliments her performance at Sectionals (but also notes its flaws) before explaining that the library is a favourite place of his to pick up celebrity lifestyle tips from the books and the two of them sit down at a piano to perform a duet of the Lionel Richie hit, \"Hello\".  After their performance, Jesse invites her to sing with him again on Friday night. \n"}, {"text": "Over dinner, Brittany claims that dolphins are which of these?", "correct": "Gay sharks", "options": ["'Super hot'", "Stealing her lunch money", "Mean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGay sharks.\n\n\tAt Breadsticks, Santana and Brittany decide to send their mostly-eaten food orders back to the kitchen (Brittany goes so far as to claim that there was a rat in hers) to get more to eat.  Shortly after this, they talk about 'hot guys' in their school including Puck who's 'super fine' and Finn who would be better off dating more popular girls like the two of them to help his reputation. Finn can hear all of this though.  He's sitting in front of them during dinner.  When he asks to be included in their conversation, Santana explains that he pays for their dinner and they make out every once in a while before making fun of Rachel. When Finn tries to stand up for Rachel, the girls ask him to wait in the car and to leave his credit card.  As he leaves, Brittany informs Santana that dolphins are just gay sharks. \n"}, {"text": "According to Will, the only movies Terri left behind at the apartment were by which director?", "correct": "Jerry Bruckheimer", "options": ["John Hughes", "Martin Scorsese", "Steven Spielberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerry Bruckheimer.\n\n\tAt Will's apartment, he and Emma have their date and the two of them have a candlelit dance to Neil Diamond's \"Hello Again' (from \"The Jazz Singer\").  Will comments that he always had a soft spot for the song though he doesn't know why, but he was inspired by the week's assignment to play it on their date.  When the two of them begin to kiss, Emma stops Will because too much is happening too fast.  This is when she reveals that she has never been intimate with anyone before because she hadn't found the right person yet.  Will is supportive of her and decides that they could just watch a movie instead.  It's a choice between the only movies Terri left behind: \"Armageddon\" and \"Bad Boys\".  (She liked to have Bruckheimer night every other week.)\rAt school, Finn approaches Rachel and gives his honest opinion.  He doesn't want to date other girls- only Rachel.  Rachel reveals that it's too late as she's with Jesse now.  Although Finn thinks it's a bit suspicious that the rival team's leading male is dating Rachel so close to competition, Rachel believes that their \"Romeo and Juliet\" relationship will work.  When Rachel leaves, Finn heads straight to Mr. Schuester to spread the word. \n"}, {"text": "What AC/DC song does Jesse sing with Vocal Adrenaline?", "correct": "Highway to Hell", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHighway to Hell.\n\n\tSantana and Brittany both report back to Sue who criticizes their ability to seduce Finn even though they claim that they seriously tried.  Santana is able to dig up the info about Jesse St. James though, and Sue says that this tidbit of info may be enough to earn her a victory.\rJesse, meanwhile, is performing \"Highway to Hell\" with his Glee Club, Vocal Adrenaline, three-time winners of Regionals and the previous year's National champions in show choir.  Will walks in as their performance ends to find their coach, Shelby Corcoran, informing the kids that they need to smile more during their routine.  Jesse puts on his 'show face' for an example and Shelby notes that she wants a face that looks like it could cure cancer.  When the kids head offstage, Will introduces himself to Shelby and addresses the issue at hand.  Shelby claims that they aren't spying and that Jesse's a good kid.  In regards to his relationship with Rachel, she says that sometimes there's just that spark. \n"}, {"text": "According to Terri, what is the significance of the song \"Hello Again\" from \"The Jazz Singer\"?", "correct": "It was her and Will's prom song", "options": ["It was her and Will's wedding song", "It was their first duet", "It was the first song Will performed when he was in Glee Club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was her and Will's prom song.\n\n\tShelby and Will head to Will's place having attained that spark kind of quickly.  When the two of them are getting intimate on Will's couch, he stops himself and decides that he just can't do it.  Instead, the two of them talk over coffee and Shelby notes that she saw Will at their Invitationals many months earlier.  She also says that Vocal Adrenaline has been ruling her life as she hasn't had a date in three years.  Will echoes the sentiment claiming that it probably played a big part in ending his marriage.  Shelby soon discovers that he isn't divorced...and that he's been dating Emma.  She leaves her card, thanks Will, and suggests that he find himself before he find another girl.\rIn school, Mercedes, Artie, Kurt, and Tina speak with Rachel about Jesse and suggest that she end the relationship as it'll probably hurt the team.  Rachel says that they can't kick her out, but they all say that they'll leave if she doesn't do something about it.  Later in the day, Sue invites Rachel to a meeting of the McKinley High Old Maids Club in one of the school rooms and Rachel is subjected to some of her greatest fears.  The conclusion, according to Sue, is to become more narcissistic than ever to make sure she doesn't end up like the creepy women in the Old Maids Club.\rIn Will's apartment, Emma plans to surprise him with dinner and she sets the table as Terri comes in to pick up her last couple of DVDs.  Although Emma stands up for herself, she's shocked when Terri discovers a copy of \"The Jazz Singer\" and she notes that \"Hello Again\" was their prom song.

The two embrace while Shelby watches from offstage.\rEmma finds Will in her office and presents the yearbook to him.  When Will realizes that \"Hello Again\" is significant from his relationship with Terri, Emma states that perhaps he's not quite over her.  She decides that Will needs to find himself and determine his place as an individual.  In the meantime, she can prepare herself for when she's ready to have a relationship.  Will agrees.\rRachel meets with Finn in the halls at school and says that she ended it with Jesse (despite the fact that she hasn't).  Finn reminds her that he still wants to be with her, but she says she can't do it for the sake of the team.  Finn says that he won't be able to get rid of him that easily.\rAs the episode closes, New Directions sings their rendition of The Beatles song \"Hello, Goodbye\" in their auditorium.  As the song comes to an end, Rachel is unable to face Finn and she leaves the stage. \n"}]}
