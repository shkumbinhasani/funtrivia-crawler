Tokyo will never be the same after Hawkeye and Trapper get finished with it! \n"}, {"text": "Before Trapper and Hawkeye can be off on their little sojourn to Japan, they discover wonderful news, according to General Clayton a cease fire has been announced.

", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Henry", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tNaturally, Trapper unenthusiastically signs Radar's scrapbook, knowing full well that the cease fire is a phony.
