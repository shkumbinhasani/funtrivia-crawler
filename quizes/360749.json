He was the son of the future George V and Mary of Teck, and the great-grandson of the monarch of the time, Queen Victoria. \rSandringham House was the birthplace of Edward's brother, the future George VI. Edward's grandfather, Edward VII, and King William IV (an ancestor of Prime Minister David Cameron) were both born in Buckingham Palace. Charles I, born in 1600, was the only English/British monarch born in Dunfermline Palace. \n"}, {"text": "Edward was his real first name, but what other Christian names was the future Edward VIII given?", "correct": "Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David", "options": ["Albert Frederick Arthur George", "Philip Arthur George", "Henry Charles Albert David"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbert Christian George Andrew Patrick David.\n\n\tEdward was given the title \"His Highness Prince Edward of York\" at birth. He was baptized Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David three weeks later, in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward Benson, presiding.\rEdward was chosen in honor of his late uncle and Christian came from his great-grandfather King Christian IX of Denmark. Queen Victoria chose Albert and the last four names are the Patron Saints of the four countries of the United Kingdom. Family and close friends always knew him by his last given name, David.\rThe alternatives are the names given to other 20th century royal princes.

Albert Frederick Arthur George were the given names of Edward's brother, the future George VI. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Edward go to university?", "correct": "Magdalen College, Oxford", "options": ["University of St Andrews", "Jesus College, Cambridge", "Trinity College, Cambridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagdalen College, Oxford.\n\n\tIn 1909, Edward went to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth with plans to enter the Royal Navy. His father became king on the death of his grandfather, Edward VII, in 1910, and Edward became Prince of Wales on his 16th birthday that year. He left Dartmouth prior to graduation and then served for three months as a midshipman aboard the battleship \"Hindustan\", before going to Magdalen College, Oxford. He left Oxford in his third year without gaining any qualifications.\rOf the alternatives, Prince William of Cambridge went to St Andrews; Edward's brother, the future George VI and Prince Charles both studied at Trinity College, Cambridge; whilst Charles's younger brother, Edward, attended Jesus College, Cambridge. \n"}, {"text": "Ignoring the disputed reigns of Lady Jane Grey and the Empress Matilda, only one English or British monarch since the time of William I in 1066 has reigned for a shorter period that Edward VIII. Which one?", "correct": "Edward V", "options": ["John", "Richard II", "Edward VI"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward V.\n\n\tEdward VIII became king on the death of his father, George V, on January 20 1936. Just 326 days later, on December 11 that same year, he abdicated the throne, leaving his brother, Bertie, to ascend as King George VI.\rIn addition to Lady Jane Grey (9 days) and the Empress Matilda (208 days), there have been a total of five other English monarchs (and one Welsh one) whose reigns were shorter than Edward VIII. \rWhen I originally wrote the question, I asked who was the only monarch since the Norman Conquest to reign for a shorter time for Edward, but the astute amongst you might quite reasonably claim that King Edgar II was a correct answer. Edgar claimed the throne on October 15 1066, the day after the Battle of Hastings, and technically reigned for 63 days until William the Conqueror became king on December 17. \rThe only British monarch since William I to reign for as a shorter period was Edward V, one of the \"Princes in the Tower\" who disappeared mysteriously. Edward V became king at the age of 12 when his father, Edward IV, died on April 9 1483. The young boy's reign officially lasted just 78 days, although exactly when he died is unknown. What is certain is that his uncle claimed the throne as Richard III on June 26 that same year.\rOf the alternatives: Edward VI, King Henry VIII's only legitimate son, became king when he was nine years old in 1537. He died six and a half years later. John, although an unpopular king, actually reigned for more than 17 years from 1199 until 1216. Richard II lasted even longer -- a reign of over 22 years from 1377 until 1399. The next shortest reign after Edward VIII is actually that of Edward V's probably-evil uncle, Richard III, who lasted only 2 years and 57 days before being killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. \n"}, {"text": "Who was Prime Minister throughout the reign of Edward VIII?", "correct": "Stanley Baldwin", "options": ["Ramsay MacDonald", "Neville Chamberlain", "Winston Churchill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Baldwin.\n\n\tNo new Prime Ministers were appointed during Edward's reign. Stanley Baldwin had become PM for the third time the previous year, in June 1935, and held office throughout Edward's reign. \rOf the alternatives: Neville Chamberlain succeeded Baldwin six months after Edward abdicated, in May 1937. Churchill became PM for the first time after Chamberlain, in May 1940. MacDonald was twice PM under King George V, briefly in 1924 and then from 1929 to June 1935. \n"}, {"text": "His affair and subsequent marriage to the previously twice-married American Wallis Simpson led to Edward's abdication.

She went to Oldfields School on the outskirts of Baltimore in neighboring Maryland, both the oldest and the most expensive girls' boarding school in the state.

The private ceremony was held at Ch\u00e2teau de Cand\u00e9, a castle in the commune of Monts, Indre-et-Loire just south of Tours in France. Although invited, George VI forbade any member of the Royal Family to attend, thus widening the family rift even more. \n"}, {"text": "During WWII, Edward was installed as the Governor of which British overseas territory?", "correct": "The Bahamas", "options": ["Gibraltar", "Bermuda", "The Falkland Islands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bahamas.\n\n\tEdward was known to have Nazi sympathies and it was feared that he could do considerable damage to British morale if he fell into German hands. Edward was installed as the Governor of The Bahamas where, Churchill considered, he could do the \"least damage to the British war effort\". \rIn his post-wear memoirs, Edward admitted that he admired the Germans but denied being pro-Nazi. \n"}, {"text": "Edward did not attend Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, but instead wrote about the ceremony for which publication?", "correct": "The Sunday Express", "options": ["The New York Times", "The Times [of London]", "National Geographic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sunday Express.\n\n\tThe Duke and Duchess of Windsor watched the Coronation on television at their home in Paris.
