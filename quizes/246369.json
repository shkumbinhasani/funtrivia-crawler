Ah the inconsistency of 'M*A*S*H'!\r Incidentally, the title of this episode is a play on words.  The word 'Choson' is the name of an early Korean kingdom, and also the name for the last Korean Dynasty, aka the Yi Dynasty. \n"}, {"text": "The surgeons at the 4077th have the pleasure of a second visit by Captain Sam Pak.
