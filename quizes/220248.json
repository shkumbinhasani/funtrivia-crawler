The soldiers of Fort Vancouver, fearing that the uprising would spread to the local non-hostile Klickitat tribe, rounded up the natives and took them into custody within the fort. Some of the Indians did not take kindly to this treatment, and packed their bags and left. The soldiers followed them to the area now known as Battle Ground and took them back into custody- without a battle. \n"}, {"text": "Named after a wildflower, this city on the banks of the Columbia was once known primarily for its paper mill, belching sulfurous fumes into the sky.
