{"id": "323689", "name": "Monsters Vs. Aliens Online Quiz | Monsters vs. Aliens | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", "Monsters vs. Aliens"], "questions": [{"text": "The main character is Susan.  Who is her husband to be?", "correct": "Derek", "options": ["Dylan", "Devan", "Drake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDerek.\n\n\tIn the beginning of the movie, Susan is set to marry Derek Dietl.  They planned on honeymooning in Paris; or Susan thought.  Instead, Derek wants to honeymoon in Fresno, because it would advance his newscasting career.  Derek is a self-centered man who cares more about advancing his career than he does Susan.  Derek will do anything to get in the spotlight. \n"}, {"text": "On the day of her wedding, Susan is struck by a meteor.  What does the meteor contain, which causes her to grow some 60 feet?", "correct": "Quantonium", "options": ["Tin", "Beryllium", "Earthium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuantonium.\n\n\tOn the day of her wedding, Susan Murphy is hit by a glowing greenish blue meteor that causes her to grow.  It isn't until Susan and Derek are at the altar that Derek sees that she is glowing.  She thought he meant she was pretty, but he means she is actually glowing; and suddenly she grows several feet tall.  Quantonium is apparently the most powerful substance in the universe. \n"}, {"text": "After she has grown, what name do they call Susan?", "correct": "Ginormica", "options": ["Gigantress", "Hugunga", "Enormalady"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGinormica.\n\n\tGinormica is 60 feet tall and has incredible strength, though Susan does not realize about the strength quite yet.  She is a bit clumsy with her new size, at first, and is destructive, but eventually learns to use her size for good.  Ginormica, only moments after growing, is captured by Warren R. Monger, who has been hunting monsters for 50 years.  He takes her to a top secret monster facility where he traps her with four other monsters he has collected.\r Susan does not like being called Ginormica.  Her name is Susan.  But Susan is not a very threatening name, so they call her Ginormica, instead.  Bob calls her Soo-oo-san, and scares himself a little. \n"}, {"text": "After capture, Susan meets four monsters.  The first one's name is Bob.  What does B.O.B. stand for?", "correct": "Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate", "options": ["Bob doesn't stand for anything; he's just Bob", "Bicarbonate Oxide Bicarbonate", "Bring On the Bacon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate.\n\n\tBenzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate, or BOB, for short, is a blob of a jelly-like blue substance.  He was created when scientists injected ranch flavored dessert topping into a tomato.  When the blob sprung to life, he became known as Bob.  Bob hits on lime Jello with 14 pieces of pineapple in it throughout the movie, and he also acts as if HE were Derek's fiance.  Bob does not have a brain; so he is a bit dull. \n"}, {"text": "Susan also meets Link.  How was Link created?", "correct": "He was thawed out by scientists.", "options": ["He was a genetically mutated fish.", "He was a Mogwai then turned into a Gremlin.", "He was made by an evil scientist."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was thawed out by scientists.\n\n\tLink's full name is Missing Link.  This is because, to scientists, he is a missing link.  He was found and thawed by scientists, and said to be 20,000 years old.  He is a fish-monkey martial artist, and he thinks he is tough, though he is quite out of shape.  20,000 years in a block of ice obviously isn't good for you. \n"}, {"text": "Another monster Susan meets and befriends, who is the brains of the operations, is the only monster, besides Susan, who was once human.  What monster might that be?", "correct": "Dr. Cockroach", "options": ["Dr. Spider", "Dr. Cricket", "Dr. Grasshopper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Cockroach\n\n\tDr. Cockroach came to be when his human self, known as the smartest man in the world at the time, experimented on himself.  He was trying to give himself the abilities of a cockroach but, though it did work, it had some side effects; he grew a large cockroach head.  He is, however, able to climb walls and take large amounts of damage without being hurt.  He laughs maniacally a lot and also eats garbage. \n"}, {"text": "The last monster Susan meets is much larger than her, a whopping 350 feet tall!  He has the ability to shoot silk out of his nose, and he is attracted to bright lights.  Who might this be?", "correct": "Insectosaurus", "options": ["Insectogram", "Insectivore", "Insection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsectosaurus.\n\n\tInsectosaurus was once a one inch long grub, until he was exposed to radiation, causing him to grow 350 feet tall.  He is attracted to bright lights, and that is often the only way to get him to go somewhere.  He does not speak English, but Link apparently understands his language. \n"}, {"text": "Susan gets abducted by aliens (ok, fine, ONE alien).  He wants the substance that is making her big and strong (and I don't mean vegetables).  What is this evil alien's name?", "correct": "Gallaxhar", "options": ["Gallaxhee", "Gallaxho", "Gallaxhim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGallaxhar.\n\n\tGallaxhar destroyed his entire home planet, along with all the people on it, because he got annoyed with his wife. He says he had a lot of childhood traumatic experiences growing up that we never got to hear about (but apparently we heard too much, according to Gallaxhar).  Gallaxhar intends originally to pull all the quantonium out of Susan. When he does, he decides Earth is the perfect planet to take over.  He clones himself several times, using the quantonium, and prepares himself to destroy all humans.  He says he comes in peace, but when there is a giant holographic alien head outside, you tend not to believe him. \n"}, {"text": "The main power core is located right above a certain device.  What device is it?", "correct": "Extraction Chamber", "options": ["Lesser Power Core", "Cloning Device", "It is floating in the middle of nowhere; you need a jet pack to reach it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nExtraction Chamber.\n\n\tDr. Cockroach knows that the only way to stop the invasion is to blow up the ship, using the main power core above the extraction chamber.  The extraction chamber is also where Gallaxhar extracts (hence the name) the quantonium out of Susan.  When the monsters reach the power core, Dr. Cockroach sees a color code, and begins dancing like mad on it, and somehow cracks the code, thus enabling the self-destruct on the ship.  Dr. Cockroach mentions that his Phd was in dancing.\r The clones are not the brightest in the bunch.  All Bob has to do is ask them where the main power core is.  In another instance, the three monsters disguise themselves (though not very well) as aliens, and one alien sees right through one of their disguises, but not the other two.  He orders the other two to take the \"imposter\" away, and notices they are not armed, and offers them a gun.  Bob then (accidentally) shoots him. \n"}, {"text": "In a blip at the end of the movie, President Hathaway accidentally presses the wrong button.  What happens when he presses the wrong button, instead of the one that gets him a latte?", "correct": "All missiles are deployed.", "options": ["The vice president's head blows up.", "He gets tea instead.", "Earth is destroyed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll missiles are deployed.\n\n\tPresident Hathaway is not a very smart president.  He installed two buttons, side by side.  One gives him a latte, and the other deploys every missile America has.  His cabinet members are not able to warn him in time, like they were able to during the entire movie.\r Warren R. Monger, at the age of 90, becomes the president's newest cabinet member in this blip.  It is he who wanted the latte.\r During the movie, he also does not want to be known as the \"president in office when the world came to an end\".  He is none too bright. \n"}]}
