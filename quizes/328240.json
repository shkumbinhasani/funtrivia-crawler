{"id": "328240", "name": "The Key, The Secret Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "In this 1990 game, keys could be found to go into mysterious keyholes, often allowing the main character to access different pathways or even the exotic Star World.  What SNES game is it?", "correct": "Super Mario World", "options": ["Super Ghouls and Ghosts", "Chrono Trigger", "Actraiser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario World.\n\n\tIn many of the levels of \"Super Mario World\" (SNES), Mario could discover a key laying on the ground and use it within the level by walking into a keyhole hidden elsewhere in the stage.  Accomplishing this feat, either by lifting the key and using it as Mario or running into the keyhole with the key in Yoshi's mouth, you could unlock secret and hidden pathways around the various areas of the game's world. In some cases, this was necessary to reach other levels, particularly in the Star World.  Keys and keyholes would become recurring objects in later Mario games including the SNES game \"Super Mario RPG: The Legend of the Seven Stars\" and others. \n"}, {"text": "In this 1997 racing game, players could drive their carts into keys and, whether they won said track or not, unlock a special challenge given to them by T. T., a talking clock.  What N64 game is this referring to?", "correct": "Diddy Kong Racing", "options": ["Mario Kart 64", "Cruisin' USA", "Star Wars Episode I: Racer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiddy Kong Racing.\n\n\tIn four of the many tracks found in the Nintendo 64 Rare game, \"Diddy Kong Racing\", players could find special keys that allowed specific versus levels to be opened: Fire Mountain, Icicle Pyramid, Darkwater Beach, and Smokey Castle.  These levels were unlike the other racing tracks of the game.  In these, four players either tried to attack each other, beat each other to collect eggs, or hoarded bananas in order to prevail and win the match. One key could be found in one of the tracks of each zone.  For example, the key for Fire mountain would be in one of the tracks of Dino Domain (check Ancient Lake!).  Finishing all four levels (and winning) allowed players to collect quarters of the T. T. Amulet, required to beat the game and fight Wizpig a second time. \n"}, {"text": "The Heart Key, Spade Key, Diamond Key, and Club Key were used in a police station in what 1998 Playstation and Nintendo 64 game?", "correct": "Resident Evil 2", "options": ["Final Fantasy VII", "Twisted Metal", "Jak and Daxter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResident Evil 2.\n\n\tBesides its survival-horror elements, the \"Resident Evil\" series has also been known to contain elaborate puzzle sequences in which players needed to shift statues, press buttons, drain entire rooms of water, and other miscellaneous stuff in order to get to the end of the game.  \"Resident Evil 2\" was no exception. All four keys were found in the Raccoon City Police Department in some ways, shapes, and forms.  Similarly, in \"Resident Evil\" (Playstation, Gamecube), players could located the Armor Key, the Sword Key, the Shield Key, and the Helmet Key for use in the Spencer Mansion.  While never really used for secrets per se, the keys were necessary in order to beat the game. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Pikmin 2\" (Gamecube), one item known as 'The Key' was used to unlock which of these?", "correct": "Challenge Mode", "options": ["A cheat code", "The final stage of the game", "An image gallery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChallenge Mode.\n\n\t'The Key', which dropped in the Citadel of Spiders in the Perplexing Pool, fell off a Beady Long Legs monster (which was previously seen in the first \"Pikmin\" game).  Also valued at 100 Pokos, The Key immediately unlocked a one or two-player Challenge Mode accessible from the main menu of the game.  While it can be argued that this really isn't a secret as it is met as an item intentionally dropped over the course of this semi-open-world game, it does unlock a pretty nifty feature which creates a multiplayer aspect of the game.  Only one Pikmin is needed to carry The Key. \n"}, {"text": "A specific key in \"Banjo-Kazooie\" was quite the elusive object.  While players couldn't get it unless they had a Gameshark, it appeared in the second game of the series, \"Banjo-Tooie\".  What kind of key was it?", "correct": "Ice Key", "options": ["Rock Key", "Brass Key", "Egg Key"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce Key.\n\n\tHiding in a cave in Freezeezy Peak, players could not actually claim the fabled Ice Key unless they performed a cheat with the Gameshark device.  An after-credits, 100% completion video showed Banjo and Kazooie claiming this and a number of secret eggs throughout the game though this idea would not really be implemented until \"Banjo-Tooie\" at which point Kazooie could hatch eggs.  The Ice Key, found on the Isle O' Hags, would later be used to open a hidden safe containing a Mega-Glowbo. \n"}, {"text": "In the MMORPG, \"World of Warcraft\", which instanced dungeon requires a key to enter?", "correct": "Scholomance", "options": ["Blackrock Caverns", "Stormwind Stockades", "Ragefire Chasm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScholomance.\n\n\tMany of the later dungeons in 'old world' \"World of Warcraft\" (consisting of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdom) will require keys to enter if you do not use the Dungeon Finder at the appropriate level, and these keys are usually given at the end of long quest chains.  Scholomance, found in the south end of the Western Plaguelands, is one of several higher-level dungeons to require a key for entry, but someone with high enough lockpicking can just open the door if need-be.  Blackrock Caverns is one of many dungeons in Blackrock Mountain (and is always open) while Stormwind Stockades and Ragefire Chasm are low-level dunegeons in the cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar, respectively. \n"}, {"text": "What type of key is usually needed to gain access to the lair of the final boss in a \"Legend of Zelda\" game?", "correct": "Boss Key & Big Key", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoss Key & Big Key.\n\n\tAptly named, the Boss Key (or in some games, the Big Key) is an item found in a particular, brightly-coloured chest of most dungeons in \"Legend of Zelda\" games (whether you play handheld or console versions).  Due to the nature of the boss being at the end of the dungeon, the said key is often one of the last items you'll pick up, but this is not always the case. In addition, some bosses don't require keys at all because the natural progression of the dungeon will lead to said room.  In addition to these, Small Keys are often used to open minor locked doors throughout the games.  All keys can only be used in the dungeons from which they are found. \n"}, {"text": "What video game series features the Keyblade as a weapon?", "correct": "Kingdom Hearts", "options": ["Metal Gear Solid", "Final Fantasy", "Ratchet and Clank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKingdom Hearts.\n\n\tWhile these never look like actual 'blades', the Keyblades of \"Kingdom Hearts\" are equippable items for the protagonist and player character.  All of these two-handed items (though occasionally you can dual-wield) are in the shape of keys and feature handles at the one end to make them seem like swords.  Keychains can also be added to said weapons for granted bonuses, but these are often difficult to obtain or require portions of the game be beaten.  The \"Kingdom Hearts\" series was created by Square-Enix, the creators of \"Final Fantasy\", and Disney. \n"}, {"text": "In Blizzard's PC game \"Diablo II\", Keys were used to do which of these things?", "correct": "Open chests", "options": ["Earn more experience", "Unlock levels", "Utilize shrines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpen chests.\n\n\tKeys could drop off defeated enemies at random or they could be bought from vendors at the town in the beginning of each Act of the game.  The only use to be seen for said items (held in sets to a maximum of twelve in a slot of your inventory) was to open chests seen throughout the game's extensive regions.  Said chests would only require keys if they were locked from the get-go, and only one member of the party needed a key to open it for everyone.  Locked chests had the capability to drop anything a regular chest could, so opening them and using the key could be a wasted effort. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these games does not involve lockpicking in any way?", "correct": "MadWorld", "options": ["Splinter Cell: Double Agent", "Fallout III", "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadWorld.\n\n\t\"MadWorld\" (for the Wii) really doesn't let up enough for players to need to open doors- Jack just uses chainsaws and stylized weapons to brutally force his way through his environments.  \"Fallout III\" and the \"Elder Scrolls\" games, both by Bethesda Studios, make use of lockpicking in their open-world mechanics as an upgradable skill or attribute.  This works on chests or containers that the player is unable to open normally or on doors.  \"Splinter Cell\" is, perhaps, the most realistic.  The player actually uses a lockpicking kit in order to open locked doors, \n"}]}
