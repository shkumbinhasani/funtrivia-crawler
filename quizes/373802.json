{"id": "373802", "name": "Fifty Shades of Huh? Quiz / Test | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Media"], "questions": [{"text": "\"'It's a pleasure to see you again, Miss Steele.' His voice warm and husky like dark chocolate melted fudge caramel ... or something.\"\n\nNone of these food items are actually the same thing, but you would probably associate them with which delectable item?", "correct": "Ice cream sundae", "options": ["Pie", "Lasagna", "Chicken wings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce cream sundae.\n\n\tOh Ms. Steele...how you have a way with words.  You can only imagine how Christian Grey's voice sounds with her vivid, descriptive, inner monologue.  How the word 'husky' equates to foodstuffs can be a mystery to some, but she's cracked it, it would seem.\r All of this being said, dark chocolate and melted fudge and caramel are all toppings you'd be likely to find drizzled over what may be the most decadent, toothache-inducing ice cream sundae known to man.  The minute you start adding these sweet and, dare I say, 'husky' confections to lasagna or chicken wings, you may be questioning your own sanity. \n"}, {"text": "\"'Um.' I feel the color in my cheeks rising again.  I must be the color of 'The Communist Manifesto'.\"\n\nWhat colour would be attributed to this, Karl Marx's most famous work?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Pink", "Black", "White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tCommunism is often attributed to the colour red because of historical revolution dating as far back as the French Revolution.  This said, many communist and socialist countries have taken on the colour since then, leading to the widespread 'Red Scare' during the Cold War.\r But alas, Ana Steele feels that her face is going the shade of Marxist literature which, in all fairness, is red, but likely a deeper red than she's capable of turning.  That Christian Grey sure puts her into a state...but a Communist state? \n"}, {"text": "\"I imagine him as an old-time movie director wearing jodhpurs, holding an old-fashioned megaphone and a riding crop.\"\n\nWhich of the following are jodhpurs?", "correct": "Pants", "options": ["Glasses", "Earrings", "Gloves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPants.\n\n\tMs. Steele so adequately made this mental image of Christian Grey while...ahem...drunk dialing him at a club.  Of course, she also pictured him as his usual, dictatorial, control-freak self.  This woman has such little self-control herself.\r In her thoughts, she's picturing Christian in riding pants as though he would be heading out on horseback.  The pants originated in India, being adapted from an existing garment.  There is, of course, also a city in India known as Jodhpur.  Holding a megaphone and a riding crop, drunk Ana is probably blending two different images together, but we know what she's getting at.  Everything leads to 'action'. \n"}, {"text": "\"I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious-- she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.\"\n\nThe hula is a dance that was invented in which region?", "correct": "Polynesia", "options": ["Southeast Asia", "Western Africa", "South America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPolynesia.\n\n\tYou would probably recognize the hula as being a Hawaiian dance; it was created by Polynesians centuries ago and involves a great deal of rotating hip movement.  The hula is known for its historical use in religious ceremony, but has also been used simply for entertainment purposes.  When people think hula, they think Hawaii.\r For some reason, Ana's 'happy dance' is the hula, implying that she simply wobbles when she gets excited about being around Christian.  Whatever makes her happy, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "\"My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.\"\n\nIn this case, the salsa refers to which of these?\n", "correct": "Dancing", "options": ["Mexican food", "Chess", "Photography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDancing.\n\n\tAnother happy dance!  As Ana's inner goddess swoons with choreographed dance stylings, it becomes clear to the reader that she's truly in love.  I mean, having an 'inner goddess' in and of itself is an indicator of how strong she is as a female protagonist, so letting loose like this is key to the reading.\r While salsa is good with tortilla chips, it's also a dance with Latin American influences combining several different styles of dance (and their regional variations) for a rhythmic, flowing routine.  While variants of the dance take notes from Cuban and Colombian nods, it was actually created in New York City. \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm all deer/headlights, moth/flame, bird/snake ... and he knows exactly what he's doing to me.\"\n\nAna's pairs here are examples of which of these comparative literary devices?", "correct": "Metaphor", "options": ["Simile", "Oxymoron", "Alliteration"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetaphor.\n\n\tA metaphor is a narrative device used to form a comparison between two different things without using the words 'like' or 'as' to bind them together (which would create a simile).  While none of these are formed explicitly as metaphors, Ana is using different creatures or things to represent herself and Christian Grey.  She's the deer; he's the headlights.  She's the moth; he's the flame.  She's the bird; he's the snake.\r The problem with this is obviously that all of them just happen to involve completely different occurrences.  If she's the deer in the headlights, she's stunned; if she's the moth to a flame, she's attracted; if she's the bird, she could be eaten by the snake.\r She obviously doesn't get the idea behind it.  But at least she knows she's in a relationship.  You have to start somewhere, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "\"From makeup remover to a soothing balm [...] who would have thought it was such a versatile liquid.\"\n\nThis statement is actually in reference to Baby Oil, an item used in cooking.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNoooo...never confuse it with a cooking oil.  Baby Oil is actually a type of mineral oil used to soothe skin as a balm; it's often perfumed to avoid being completely odourless.  That said, it's also used as a lubricant for hydraulic machinery and as a pet laxative, neither of which you're likely considering when you're slathering your infant in petroleum distillate.\r That said, Ana is clearly exposing the infinite virtues of this infinite-use item.  Christian has it on hand, which is great, but he also tends to have whips and crops on hand, so it's a bit concerning in a way.  You have to wonder where these peoples' minds are. \n"}, {"text": "\"You beguile me, Christian.  Completely overwhelm me.  I feel like Icarus flying too close to the sun,\" I whisper.\"\n\nIcarus is figure from which pantheon?", "correct": "Greek", "options": ["Roman", "Norse", "Hindu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreek.\n\n\tJeeze, Anastasia.  She's just trying to sound smart at this point; who cares for the Greek God reference?  Well, maybe Christian does.\r Icarus is the Greek son of Daedalus who, after creating wings of wax and feathers, flew too close to the sun (way up there) and came crashing down when they melted away.  Ahhh...the folly of Gods.  Icarus subsequently became a major focus for artists throughout the centuries, appearing in artwork and literature dating as far back as Medieval times.\r You may say that Ana's all \"Icarus/Sun\" with Christian.  Then again, it's hard to tell if she'd put it into the right context. \n"}, {"text": "\"Will he punish me?  I quail at the thought.  I haven't signed that contract yet.  Perhaps I won't.\"\n\nWhile quail, as a verb, means 'to wither away', it's also a noun referring to which of these?", "correct": "A bird", "options": ["A shoe", "A hairstyle", "A gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bird.\n\n\tFound throughout the world, the quail is a small bird considered a rather choice bit of poultry in the cooking world.  It's not too common (compared to chicken, for example), but it tends to be on the higher end from a culinary standpoint.  While they do appear in the wild, they're more commonly raised on farms, primarily for their small eggs-- again, a unique choice of food.\r But again, Ana's got a lot on her mind.  Does she sign the contract and become a slave to Christian Grey, spending her days quailing at his very touch?  Or does she not sign the contract, opting instead to quail away at the notion of being with him.  Either way, she's a bird-brain. \n"}, {"text": "\"I gaze at my mom.  She *is* on her fourth marriage.  Maybe she does know something about men after all.\"\n\nWhich of these famous women married the least?", "correct": "Geena Davis", "options": ["Zsa Zsa Gabor", "Elizabeth Taylor", "Joan Collins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeena Davis.\n\n\tZsa Zsa Gabor had nine husbands (including the founder of the Hilton Hotel chain, Conrad Hilton), Elizabeth Taylor had seven different husbands (including the son of the founder of the Hilton Hotel chain, Conrad Hilton, Jr.), and Joan Collins married five men (none of which had Hilton money, but who may have once stayed in a Hilton Hotel).\rGeena Davis only married four times.  Can you believe it?  Hardly enough!\r But egads, Ana.  If you're looking for relationship advice, maybe you pick someone who can hold onto a man? \n"}]}
