Both \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" and \"The Suite Life on Deck\" involve Zack and Cody Martin.  However, only in \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" do they crawl around the vents to get around the hotel. Zack and Cody usually end up being caught, and occasionally see Mr. Moseby in the ducts waiting for them around the corner.  Those ducts are rather roomy.  In one episode, Cody even mentions that the ducts never seem to be any smaller even though they are getting bigger. The show ran from March of 2005 to September of 2008, where the boys move to the SS Tipton, a cruise ship where they now school on \"The Suite Life on Deck\". \n"}, {"text": "In 2006, Tim Allen crawled around in a ventilation duct.

Blart captured the enemies in several different ways, including trapping someone in a ball pit, knocking someone out with ventilation ducts, and hiding as a hockey player mannequin and attacking someone from behind.\r This isn't the only scene Paul is in the ducts, however.  He manages to get to the hostages at one point in time, and tries to bring them to safety through the ducts.  However, the weight of so many people causes the vent to break, and they all fall through the ceiling right back to where they started. \n"}, {"text": "For this question, we move to another Tim Allen movie.  It is not necessarily a ventilation duct, but there are fans in here, and it is in the interior of the ship.

In one scene, Jason and Gwen must travel through the ducts to turn off the self-destruct.  When they are traveling across a small beam over a fan, they look up, and see the Omega 13.

Now it is time for a video game--that is more my style!\n\nAnyway, there is a certain video game character who spends a lot of time in the ventilation ducts.

Sly spends a lot of time in the ducts.  He takes a lot of pictures of people and objects with his camera, so you must hide in the ducts so as not to get caught.  Sly is a thief, so he strives not to be seen by any guards. But he is a good thief.  He usually 'steals back what was wrongfully stolen.'  \"Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\" was released in 2002, \"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\" was released in 2004, and \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\" was released in 2005.

Without the ducts running smoothly, a serious disease can be caught.  If the room is poorly ventilated, the air conditioning can actually spread this disease around.  What disease was first discovered during an outbreak in Philadelphia in 1976?", "correct": "Legionnaire's Disease", "options": ["Epstein Barr Syndrome", "Schizophrenia", "Common Cold"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLegionnaire's Disease.\n\n\tLegionellosis is an infection one can get from bacteria.  Legionnaire's Disease is the more serious form of legionellosis, and can cause pneumonia.  It is caused by breathing in the bacteria particles into the lungs from the air.  You cannot see this bacteria, so you don't know if you breathed some in until you show symptoms.  Some cases are very severe, while others produce very few symptoms, and sometimes none at all!\r Thanks to Rowena8482 for help with this question. \n"}, {"text": "Uh oh, now I'm in the ventilation ducts!  I sure hope I don't die.\n\nIs it possible to die in a ventilation duct?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt is most definitely possible to die in the ventilation ducts.  There are several ways in which this can happen.  One, you could try to squeeze through a small opening, get stuck, and die.  Two, you could cut yourself on a piece of metal or something and bleed to death.  Three, you could get lost in the vents, and not find your way out, and die of starvation. Four, the heater could turn on, and you would die of too much heat.  It is possible to be burned by the metal, or worse; you could suffer a lot of water loss, and therefore die of dehydration.  So, please, I am begging you, don't try to crawl through the ventilation ducts! \n"}]}
