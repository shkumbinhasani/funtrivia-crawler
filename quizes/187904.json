{"id": "187904", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Fade In, Fade Out' (Part I) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "Two oddities, to begin this quiz.  The first occurs up at the helipad, where Radar and Colonel Potter share a cigar while waiting for a chopper that is supposed to be carrying Frank Burns.  Potter offers Radar a cigar, and the latter accepts, but not before asking which of these questions?", "correct": "Will it stunt my growth?", "options": ["You won't tell my ma, will you?", "Won't it make my teeth turn yellow?", "Don't those things make you act funny?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill it stunt my growth?.\n\n\tWhat is odd about this scene, you ask?  Well, in the season one episode called 'Chief Surgeon, Who?' Radar is depicted smoking a cigar as if it is a regular habit of his.  However, in this episode the more innocent Radar appears, asking if the cigar will stunt his growth (Potter responds: 'What have you got to lose?) and if cigar smoking is habit forming (Potter responds: 'I've been smoking five cigars a day for 45 years, never got the habit.').  Radar needs instructions on when to suck in the smoke and later throws up after taking in too much of the nasty stuff. \n"}, {"text": "The second oddity in the introductory sequence of this episode occurs in the mess tent.  Which 'M*A*S*H' character is apparently rather naive about the relationship between Margaret and Frank?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Klinger", "Nurse Kellye", "BJ"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tDespite having lived alongside Burns and Houlihan for months, Father Mulcahy claims to only have a 'suspicion' about the relationship between the two erstwhile lovers.  Hawkeye has to explain that Margaret and Frank 'knew each other in the biblical sense' ('Both testaments', BJ adds.)  I have a hard time believing anyone, even a priest, could be this naive. \n"}, {"text": "The idyllic scene at the beginning of the episode is wrecked by the sounds of helicopters and ambulances, all fully laden with war wounded.  One of the patients that is brought into the 4077th Is a doctor who has a shell fragment near his heart.  What is this doctor's name?", "correct": "Berman", "options": ["Horowitz", "Kowalski", "Moody"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBerman.\n\n\tWhen Hawkeye and Colonel Potter approach Dr. Berman during triage, Berman self-diagnoses.  He claims that he's not going to make it and asks for a rabbi.  Potter responds, 'Knock that off Berman, nobody dies around here without my say-so.'  Hawkeye is able to patch Berman up, but there is still concern about an aneurysm that has developed near Berman's heart. \n"}, {"text": "While the doctors are still busy in the O.R., Colonel Potter receives a call from military police at I-Corps.  The call is in reference to Frank, who has been accused of 'accosting a blonde WAC' in Seoul'.  Which of these did Frank not do to this poor, unsuspecting woman?", "correct": "Kiss her fingertips", "options": ["Beg to clip her toenails", "Repeatedly call her 'Margaret'", "Pretend to 'shampoo' her hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKiss her fingertips.\n\n\tFrank has obviously become delirious over Margaret's marriage, and on his R&R has made it a mission to locate his ex-girlfriend by any means necessary.  Apparently, Frank was drunk when he accosted the blonde WAC (Women's Army Corps), and, according to the sergeant calling from I-Corps, he ran off before the MPs could take him into custody. \n"}, {"text": "With Frank Burns seemingly AWOL, Colonel Potter is desperate to find a replacement surgeon.  He requests that Radar call Tokyo General and ask for a Colonel Baldwin.  The scene then shifts to Tokyo General, where Charles is playing what game with Baldwin?", "correct": "Cribbage", "options": ["Chess", "Canasta", "Checkers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCribbage.\n\n\tCharles has taken Baldwin to the cleaners, the latter owing the former $672.11 (later revised to $672.17).  It is no surprise, then, that Baldwin finds it easy to ship the pompous and gloating Charles away to the 4077th for a brief time.  It seems that Baldwin expects Charles to forget this debt...obviously, he doesn't know Charles Emerson Winchester III! \n"}, {"text": "At this point, it might be reasonable to ask the name of the actor who portrays Major Charles Emerson Winchester III.  So, who is this grand thespian?", "correct": "David Ogden Stiers", "options": ["David Hyde Pierce", "David Randall Thom", "David Terence Puttnam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers.\n\n\tDavid Ogden Stiers was, oddly enough, born in Peoria, Illinois, and does not really have a haughty, upper crust Bostonian accent.  Aside from his role in 'M*A*S*H', Stiers has made a number of apperances in other television shows and films, and perhaps most prominently has provided his voice for many of Disney's animated films (e.g. Pocahontas, Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). \n"}, {"text": "Charles has found it difficult to reach the 4077th.  By what means of transportation does he finally arrive at the M*A*S*H?", "correct": "Ox-drawn cart", "options": ["Ambulance", "On foot", "Garbage truck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOx-drawn cart.\n\n\tThe jeep that Charles had been riding in was destroyed by enemy mortars.  Charles is somehow able to locate some locals who provide him a ride to the 4077th in their family cart.  Incidentally, Charles leaves the camp in a garbage truck, hence why I included that as an incorrect choice! \n"}, {"text": "Radar is the first to greet Charles as he arrives at the 4077th.  Charles immediately complains about the smell.  What does Radar ascertain is the source of the offending odor?", "correct": "The kitchen", "options": ["Latrine", "Cesspool", "The Swamp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe kitchen.\n\n\tCharles' first impression of the 4077th: 'Charming place, an inflamed boil on the buttocks of the world.'\r After Charles is greeted by Radar, he inquires as to the noisome stench.  Radar responds, 'Uh...North wind cesspool, east wind latrine.'  Charles notes, 'The wind is from the south.'  Radar retorts, 'Oh, that's the kitchen.' \n"}, {"text": "Charles' first act as a surgeon at the 4077th is to save the life of the doctor who had come to the M*A*S*H with a shell fragment near his heart.  Charles performs surgery to correct a ventricular aneurysm, a procedure that none of the other doctors at the 4077th have never witnessed.  In his mock awe of Charles, Hawkeye calls him by what alternate surname?", "correct": "Remington", "options": ["Colt", "Wesson", "Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemington.\n\n\tHawkeye calls Charles 'Remington', seemingly by mistake, but we all know what Hawkeye is up to (hint of jealousy, perhaps?)  Later, Hawkeye asks Charles if he can 'come by later for a cup of ego'.  After the surgery, Charles insists on rubbing it in, announcing that his 'whole family has gifted hands' (his mother is a concert pianist).  Hawkeye responds by saying, 'My dad can get an olive out of the bottom of a jar with one finger.'  BJ adds, 'And leave the pimento behind.' \n"}, {"text": "The end of the first half of this episode involves a telephone call from Frank Burns, who is now in Tokyo.  Frank's drunken rampage has gotten him into a bit of trouble.  Which general (and his wife) did Frank accost, mistaking them for Margaret and Donald?", "correct": "Kester", "options": ["Bellini", "Schaeffer", "Morley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKester.\n\n\tFrank followed Brigadier General Kester and his wife into a bathhouse where he found the two of them sharing a soak in the hot water.  Frank decided to join them, in full uniform.  Poor Frank was taken into psychiatric custody and is being held for an evaluation.  He has also announced that he will be transferred out of the 4077th.  BJ responds, 'They can't do that to us.  There's so much more we wanted to say to the fink!' and 'You realize that this reduces the enemy to just North Korea!'\r Thank you for playing this quiz, if you enjoyed it, please give part two a try (not to mention my many other 'M*A*S*H'-related quizzes.) \n"}]}
