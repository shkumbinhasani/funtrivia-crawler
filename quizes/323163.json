Three friends board a chairlift moments before the ski hills close for the weekend and find themselves trapped several feet above the ground.  As frostbite starts to set in, tensions run high as their time runs short.  Ironically, one of the film's stars, Shawn Ashmore, appeared as Iceman in the \"X-Men\" movies.\r\"Frozen\" had a limited release in early 2010 and received mixed reviews from critics.  Overall, it earned just over a million dollars in the box office.  Green also directed \"Spiral\" starring \"Hatchet's\" star, Joel David Moore. \n"}, {"text": "Demon in our house.\nBought high quality camera.\nNow can't sleep at night.\n\nWhat independent 2009 film (which hit it big in the box office) does this reflect?", "correct": "Paranormal Activity", "options": ["The Blair Witch Project", "Quarantine", "Scream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParanormal Activity.\n\n\t\"Paranormal Activity\" was filmed on a budget of $15,000 though it grossed almost $200,000,000 to become the most profitable film ever made based on the investment.  Directed by Oren Peli, the movie originally only appeared in film festivals before word got out that it was a force to be reckoned with.  After one million signatures in an online petition, the movie was granted wide release and became the Halloween box office leader in 2009.  Stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat run pretty much the entire film as they are forced to deal with the paranormal events that have followed Katie through her life. With an HD camera in tow, they try to record the events that follow.  What we see on the screen is regarded as archived footage released by the police - the movie has no opening or closing credits to heighten realism.  Acting sparingly with the special effects at hand, the film was praised by critics. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, we're in space.\nSure, there's a familiar face,\nbut mask is metal.\n\nWhat 2002 horror sequel does this describe?", "correct": "Jason X", "options": ["Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare", "Leprechaun 4: In Space", "Halloween: Resurrection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason X.\n\n\t\"Jason X\", released in theaters in 2002, was one of the lowest-grossing films in the \"Friday the 13th\" film franchise starring Jason Voorhees as the hockey masked killer.  Sure, he comes back for \"Jason X\", but he's frozen and then thawed in the future.  What's worse?  Jason gets an 'upgrade', causing much of his body to become indestructible metal.  I tell you, he always finds a way.\rThe movie made a mere $16,000,000.  Its director, James Isaac, made \"Skinwalkers\" a few years later; it did worse.  \"Jason X\" was the last film in the series to star Kane Hodder as Jason.  He was replaced by Ken Kirzinger for \"Freddy vs. Jason\" in 2003. \n"}, {"text": "Esther's got problems.\nTaken in by the Colemans,\nShe's a troubled girl.\n\nWhat 2009 movie fits the haiku?", "correct": "Orphan", "options": ["The Hand That Rocks the Cradle", "The Omen", "Case 39"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrphan.\n\n\t\"Orphan\", released in 2009, was well-received by viewers and critics alike earning over $70,000,000 in the box office.  Starring Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard, the movie follows a family looking to adopt a young child.  They find Esther at their local orphanage and select her after she shows herself to be different, artistic, well-mannered, and charming.  Little do they know, she harbours a much deadlier secret than she's letting on.  An adorable girl on the outside, the family realizes the issue at hand a little too late.\r\"Orphan\" was produced by Joel Silver and Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also filmed \"House of Wax\" a few years earlier. \n"}, {"text": "It's a fear study.\nI find people's unique fears,\nand push their limits.\n\nWhich After Dark Horrorfest entry is this 2009 film?", "correct": "Dread", "options": ["Borderlands", "Hidden", "Kill Theory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDread.\n\n\t\"Dread\", based on a Clive Barker short story from his second \"Books of Blood\" collection, followed a group of students preparing a thesis revolving around the emotion known as 'dread'.  One of the students suffers from a suppressed fear of meat, another must face a brutal murder of his family, another is afraid of drunk drivers, and one more dreads a condition she was born with.  One of the kids involved in the study becomes more and more interested in what makes people dread, their limits, and their actions when they're forced to face their true fears.\rThe movie, directed by Anthony DiBlasi, starred Jackson Rathbone of (OMG) \"Twilight\" and Shaun Evans.  In 2009 after a brief, limited cinema release, it was picked up as the first of eight films in After Dark's fourth annual Horrorfest. \n"}, {"text": "Trapped at the movies.\nIt gets worse with these demons.\nAlso, \"White Wedding\".\n\nWhat 1985 Italian gore-fest is this haiku describing?", "correct": "D\u00e8moni", "options": ["Tenebre", "Suspiria", "Terror Train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD\u00e8moni.\n\n\t\"D\u00e8moni\", directed by Lamberto Bava and produced by Giallo master Dario Argento, was the first in a series of films about demonic ghouls with a relentless penchant for making things graphic.  A group of people are invited to a screening of a movie at a local theater only to find themselves boarded up inside. Things get worse when one of the audience members accidentally cuts herself on a prop from the film causing her to mutate into a demon herself.  Now, everyone she kills becomes a demon.  The chain continues perpetually.  A helicopter crashes at one point, there's a motorcycle scene with a samurai sword, and there's tons of 1980s music (including Billy Idol).  The first sequel took place in an apartment building and it was followed by many more films in succession. \n"}, {"text": "You die in the game,\n(this is where it gets tricky)\nYou die in real life.\n\nWhat 2006 movie would follow this haiku quite well?", "correct": "Stay Alive", "options": ["One Missed Call", "Pulse", "The Signal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStay Alive.\n\n\t\"Stay Alive\", starring Frankie Muniz shortly before he left \"Malcolm in the Middle\" and became a race car driver, was a film crossing the worlds of horror movies and video games.  It needed the extra life.  The mantra that 'you die in the game, you die for real' is followed throughout.  When a game chronicling the slaying of Count Elizabeth Bathory is handed out for beta testing, the game is inexplicably linked to the supernatural.  The characters die in the methods they are killed in the game, however brutal or illogical.  This forces the cast to travel to Bathory's nearby estate (near New Orleans) to stop it and stay alive.\rThe movie was directed by William Brent Bell and was critically panned, earning only $27,000,000 in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Seven days in all.\nFind a way to stop your death.\nEvil girl in well.\n\nWhat 2002 movie would this describe?", "correct": "The Ring", "options": ["The Grudge", "The Return", "The Orphanage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ring.\n\n\tDirected by Gore Verbinski (who went on to direct the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films), \"The Ring\" was the first in a number of films in the J-horror phase of American cinema (which included \"The Grudge\", \"Pulse\", and many others).  It may have been the only one to be well-received by critics; it earned almost $250,000,000 in the box office and received a shoddy sequel a few years after its release.  The American version starred Naomi Watts.  The film was based of the K\u00f4ji Suzuki novel, \"Ringu\".\rIn the film, Watts plays a reporter who stumbles on a video tape while investigating her niece's death.  It turns out, the tape is connected to a horrible paranormal curse, and she has seven days to figure out how to prevent her own death. \n"}, {"text": "Rolling in mid-day,\nIt traps townspeople inside.\nMonsters are outside.\n\nWhat 2007 Stephen King-adapted film does this haiku describe?", "correct": "The Mist", "options": ["The Fog", "The Green Mile", "The Body"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Mist.\n\n\t\"The Mist\" was director Frank Darabont's third Stephen King film; he previously directed \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Green Mile\".  \"The Mist\" starred Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden.
