{"id": "326094", "name": "\"Mash-Up\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "In the beginning of the episode, someone unexpected is on the receiving end of a Slushee facial.  Who gets hit with this frozen drink?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Puck", "Quinn", "Mercedes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tThe opening of the episode follows the Slushee down the halls of school as it finds its target.  Passing by many of the usual Glee kid suspects, it hits Finn in the face.  Finn retaliates at its buyer, one of the guys on the hockey team, but it's all for naught.  Now, with Quinn pregnant and the two of them singing in Glee, they're on the bottom of the school's social ladder (even below hockey guys).\rIn the staff lunch room, Ken and Emma approach Will for a favour.  Their wedding is to be held in Hawaii (Emma's idea- this way they're far from the people they know) and Ken wants the two of them to have their first dance.  The only problem is their song choices.  Emma wants \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" from \"My Fair Lady\" while Ken wants Sisqo's \"The Thong Song\".  Will offers his assistance for the mash-up of the two songs (and dance lessons for Emma) as a wedding gift. \n"}, {"text": "What song does Will claim to be a personal favourite during Glee practice?", "correct": "\"Bust a Move\" by Young MC", "options": ["\"Ice Ice Baby\" by Vanilla Ice", "\"U Can't Touch This\" by MC Hammer", "\"Hate On Me\" by Jill Scott"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Bust a Move\" by Young MC.\n\n\tWill talks to the kids in the choir room about his project.  He wants them to find a good way to mash up some songs this time and despite the recent debacle with Sue in the past weeks, he feels they have enough time before Sectionals.  Will explains that sometimes, things can seem so different that they'll never go together but the difference between them is what makes their synergy.  He hands them all a copy of Young MC's \"Bust a Move\" before breaking into a song and dance with the kids.\rQuinn and Finn, concerned about their lack of popularity, turn to Emma for help as she is their guidance counselor.  Emma really has no ideas but she gets distracted by Will as he walks by her office.  This causes her to blurt something out about sunglasses.  Covering her tracks, she recommends that Quinn and Finn wear sunglasses but the most important thing is that they be themselves. \n"}, {"text": "On what day does Ken decide to add another football practice every week?", "correct": "Thursday", "options": ["Wednesday", "Sunday", "Tuesday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThursday.\n\n\tEmma arrives for her dance lessons with Will in her cousin's wedding dress; she claims that her cousin was obsessed with Princess Diana's wedding and insisted on a long train but because she never practiced dancing in the dress, she and her husband had a horrible first dance and ended up divorced three months later.  Will commences his dance lessons to Ken's song choice: \"The Thong Song\" by Sisqo, but ends up tripping over Emma's dress.  On the floor, he claims that she needs a new one while Ken watches from the next room.\rDuring football practice, Finn fights with another player over Glee and Ken breaks them up saying that they all need to work as a team.  Since they've only won one game (seen in the \"Preggers\" episode) he's having an additional football practice on Thursdays at 3:30pm.  Finn realizes that this is the same time as Glee and Ken says that he'll just have to choose what's more important. \n"}, {"text": "When Puck visits Rachel's house to practice singing, what song does she perform in front of the mirror?", "correct": "\"What a Girl Wants\"", "options": ["\"That's What Girls Do\"", "\"Defying Gravity\"", "\"Endless Love\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"What a Girl Wants\".\n\n\tInstead of attending football practice, Puck spends his afternoon at Rachel's place.  After watching \"Schindler's List\" with his mother one night, Puck had a dream that Rachel climbed into his window wearing the Star of David around her neck.  Acting upon this and his mother's earlier wishes to marry a good, Jewish girl, he brings his guitar over for a make-out session in her bedroom. Rachel can't keep her mind off Finn though and makes an excuse to stop seeing Puck.  She says that she can't be with someone who isn't willing to perform a solo as they would not be brave enough to brave the tumultuous ups and downs of a relationship with her high-maintenance self. So he begins to work. \n"}, {"text": "Does wearing sunglasses help to improve Finn and Quinn's popularity at school?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe next day in Glee, Puck stands up to perform a song solo on his guitar (with the band): Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\", his tribute to a Jewish music icon.  The club is thrilled as he sings, but Finn shows concern throughout the song that he may be shown up and Santana has a peculiar look on her face hinting that she may be after him as well.\rFinn and Quinn test out Emma's sunglasses idea wearing them in school and thinking that it's actually working.  Rounding a corner, the two of them find themselves trapped by the football team for a round of Slushees.  Once more, what was once the most popular couple in school is on the receiving end.  They warn Finn to leave Glee Club, or else. \n"}, {"text": "When Sue is asked on a date by the local news anchorman, she asks Will to teach her what dance style?", "correct": "Swing", "options": ["Ballroom", "Salsa", "Tap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwing.\n\n\tAfter finishing a 'Sue's Corner' segment for the local news station, Sue is approached by the anchor who asks her over for fondue.  She agrees and quickly asks Will for swing lessons.  After a quick round through Louis Prima's \"Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)\" in the choir room, Sue and Will seem to act like good friends. She explains that she's no longer at his throat because she's in love.  Her first date went well and after a rousing game of \"Battleship\", she was asked if she liked to swing.  Sue also lets it slip to Will that Ken has been making the kids choose between football and Glee.  When Will goes to talk to him, Ken brings the issue up immediately regarding Emma and Will apologizes that he hasn't done anything to stop her actions. Ken keeps his practice date on Thursday to determine who the kids choose. \n"}, {"text": "Who sings the song \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" in this episode?", "correct": "Emma", "options": ["Tina", "Rachel", "Quinn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma.\n\n\tWaling down the hallway arm-in-arm, Rachel tells Puck that she's proud of him for making the solo and that he's a great performer.  Moments after this, he becomes the next Slushee target and they spend the next while drying him off and cleaning him up in the bathroom sink.  He admits to her that when the clock hits 3:30 that afternoon, he'd probably be choosing football over Glee.  She takes this as her cue to leave as once he chooses sports, they'd no longer be able to stay together.\rMeanwhile, Emma and Will go out to try on a new wedding dress.  Emma makes her selection and Will is surprised at how beautiful she looks.  Having brought an instrumental version of her wedding song as a test run, the two of them dance around the store with Emma providing the vocals.  After their session, Will says that he has to leave- the showdown between himself and Ken is soon and he needs to be back to support the kids.  Emma is surprised by this news as she hadn't heard a thing about the issue. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these students chooses football practice over Glee?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Matt", "Puck", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tWhen 3:30pm rolls around, Matt and Mike are first to walk through the door but everyone is most surprised by Puck following behind them.  When Rachel asks if he's okay with getting a Slushee in the face every morning, he says that he's fine with it.  Finn, meanwhile, stays for football practice.\rThe next day, Finn is the one dealing out the Slushee and he is forced to make a beeline straight for Kurt.  Kurt tells him to do it while the other Glee kids watch and Finn is hesitant.  Rather than wait for the inevitable, Kurt takes the Slushee from his hands and hits himself in the face with it asking Finn if any of the kids on the football team would do it for him.  As Finn goes to think about this, the girls rush Kurt off to the bathroom. \n"}, {"text": "According to Rachel, what was her relationship with Puck based on?", "correct": "Fantasy", "options": ["Jealousy", "Love", "Curiosity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFantasy.\n\n\tSue shows up for her next date at the news station wearing a zoot suit.  She is shocked, however, to find that the anchor, Rod, is also dating his co-anchor, Andrea.  Rod tells Sue that he's not able to be caged and that he also has a tendency to date other women- even his wife was able to understand that.  Sue calls off their relationship.\rPuck watches the football team practice from a distance as Rachel sits behind him for a talk.  She asks if he stayed with Glee for her but she deduces that he did it for Quinn.  Puck, similarly, calls her out for liking Finn, but the two of them are stuck while Quinn's pregnant.  When Rachel asks if they can stay friends, he says they weren't friends to begin.\rWill decides to have a chat with Finn on the football field and convinces him that this is the time that he needs to make a choice.  He can either let other people decide who he is or he can make his own decision. \n"}, {"text": "Does Will find a proper way to mash up both selected wedding songs?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tFinn talks to Ken in the locker room.  It's hard for him to lead since he can't focus; he has too hard a choice to make with football and Glee.  He hopes for a time where he can do both because the more different he is, the better.  Ken cancels the Thursday practice and tells Finn to tell the other guys the same.\rSue finds Will in the hallways at school and tells him to give her a laminated copy of Glee Club's Regionals setlist; he quickly deduces that things didn't work out with Rod.  As Sue continues through the hallway, she also comes across Quinn and bluntly tells her that she's off the Cheerios squad- she's too much of a disgrace.\rWill talks to Emma about the mash-up and they both come to the realization that the songs simply don't go together.  They're both great songs though.  Emma thanks him for the lessons regardless.\rGlee Club celebrates their reunion with a round of Slushees (bought by Finn).  He toasts Will before Artie lets him know that they couldn't find a mash-up for \"Bust a Move\".  Quinn is also visibly down.  Now that she's off the Cheerios, she'll have to take a Slushee daily.  Will tells her that all of her friends in Glee will be behind her.  To top it all off, the club ends up throwing their Slushees at Mr. Schuester. \n"}]}
