{"id": "229352", "name": "Star Wars: A New Hope III Quiz / Test | Star Wars | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Wars", "SW: Episode IV - A New Hope"], "questions": [{"text": "As we enter this quiz, Luke and his friends have just made their way into Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine, where they will soon meet up with Han Solo and Chewbacca.  Which of the key characters makes the following observation upon entry into Mos Eisley: 'I can't abide those jawas, disgusting creatures.'?", "correct": "C-3PO", "options": ["Han Solo", "Obi-Wan", "Luke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nC-3PO.\n\n\tA shockingly prejudicial comment from a droid whose job involves interpretation and protocol!  Perhaps his experience in the giant jawa transport was not a pleasant one?  Regardless, it looks like C-3PO needs an intervention from a consultant on diversity. \n"}, {"text": "With the expert band of musicians called Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes playing in the background, we enter one of the most memorable scenes in 'Star Wars', namely the cantina scene.  While Luke is being picked on by an Aqualish (aka 'Walrus Man'), with whom does Obi-Wan chat at the bar?", "correct": "Chewbacca", "options": ["Han Solo", "Greedo", "The Bartender"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChewbacca.\n\n\tObi-Wan is introduced to Han Solo via Chewbacca, with whom he chats at the bar.  Apparently, Obi-Wan can understand the Wookiee language Shyriiwook quite well, as he has no difficulty communicating with our hairy friend from Kashyyyk.  (That was the single dorkiest sentence I have ever written.) \n"}, {"text": "During the cantina scene, Han Solo does away with any uncertainty about the fact that the Millennium Falcon is a symbolic extension of his fragile male ego by bragging about his ship's capabilities.  According to Han Solo, the Milennium Falcon has made 'the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs'.  What else does he say about his beloved ship?", "correct": "It can outrun imperial starships", "options": ["It's equipped with a double hyperspace drive", "It was used in the Clone Wars", "It's the oldest freighter in the galaxy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt can outrun imperial starships.\n\n\tNot just imperial starships, but the 'big Corellian ships', according to Han.  \r As for the Kessel Run, apparently it is a famed route for smugglers.  Oddly enough, a parsec is not a unit of time, but rather of distance.  Perhaps Han Solo's excitement induced by his braggadocio led him to make this misstatement?\r Obi-Wan and Luke look suitably impressed by Han's claims about the Falcon (actually, they just look incredulous). \n"}, {"text": "Just as he is about to leave the cantina, Han Solo is detained by a strange greenish-blue creature who asks, 'Coona T'Chuta, Solo?'  What is this bounty hunter's name?  ", "correct": "Greedo", "options": ["Zuckuss", "Dengar", "Montross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreedo.\n\n\tGreedo is a Rodian from the planet Rodia.  Amusingly enough, Greedo's dialogue is just his actual lines played backwards. \n"}, {"text": "Han Solo and pals make a keen exit from Mos Eisley, just avoiding a pack of imperial stormtroopers armed to the teeth with blasters.  Once in space, is the Millennium Falcon able to make the jump into hyperspace on the first try?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn retrospect, this jump into light speed is surprisingly easy for the Falcon, which seems to fail pretty much every subsequent attempt.  After making the 'precise calculations', the Millennium Falcon, pursued by two Star Desroyers, launches seemlessly into hyperspace. \n"}, {"text": "On the Death Star, Princess Leia is reintroduced to the foul stench of the Grand Moff Tarkin.  Tarkin has the last laugh, however, as he convinces Princess Leia to give up the location of the secret rebel base, which she claims is on Dantooine.  After learning this, which planet does Tarkin order destroyed?", "correct": "Alderaan", "options": ["Mustafar", "Dagobah", "Dantooine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlderaan.\n\n\tLike Tatooine, the name Dantooine is derived from the Tunisian city of Tataouine, where 'Star Wars' was filmed.  It turns out, however, that Dantooine is 'too remote to make an effective demonstration' of the Death Star's power, so Tarkin orders Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan be destroyed.  Leia had hoped to save Alderaan in the first place by revealing Dantooine to be the location of the rebel base (incidentally, she lies about this)...she shouldn't have trusted Tarkin and his foul stench. \n"}, {"text": "While R2-D2 and Chewbacca play a rousing game, Luke practices his skills with a light saber.  Obi-Wan urges Luke to use the Force while tangling with a floating remote.  Han Solo scoffs at the notion, using what word to describe the Jedi 'religion'?", "correct": "Hokey", "options": ["Twerpy", "Corny", "Noddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHokey.\n\n\tThe exact line: 'Hokey religions and ancient weapons (light saber) are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.'  Han Solo further denigrates the Force by calling it 'a lot of simple tricks and nonsense'.  Oh ye of little faith! \n"}, {"text": "The Millennium Falcon emerges from hyperspace and soon finds itself captured in a tractor beam from the Death Star.  After the Falcon is drawn into the Death Star, are imperial troops able to locate the occupants of the vessel?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tStormtroopers claim that there are no life forms aboard the Falcon, and that the crew must have jettisoned themselves in an escape pod.  This seems odd, as the Empire obviously has the capability to detect life forms, as is depicted earlier in the film.  Perhaps the Falcon is equipped with a mechanism that can jam scans for lifeforms, or perhaps Obi-Wan uses the force in some way to hide their presence aboard the Falcon.  Or perhaps I need to get a life? \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the rescue mission separates himself from the rest first, in an attempt to shut down the power to the tractor beam on the Death Star?", "correct": "Obi-Wan", "options": ["Han Solo", "C-3PO", "Luke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nObi-Wan.\n\n\tObi-Wan leaves the group, setting up his inevitable epic light saber battle with Darth Vader.  The last thing Obi-Wan says to Luke in his corporeal existence is the following: 'The force will be with you, always.' \n"}, {"text": "R2-D2 is able to locate Princess Leia on the Death Star.  He claims that she is being held on the observation deck with Darth Vader.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, she's being held on Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.  Unfortunately, she's scheduled for termination (although Darth Vader has canceled her execution for now...he claims that she 'could still be of some use to us'.)\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it.
