{"id": "339816", "name": "Fifteen Minutes to Takeoff Online Trivia | Man in Space | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "Man in Space", " Space Shuttle"], "questions": [{"text": "The astronomers needed to make sure that they could launch during a \"launch window\" if they wanted to meet with another spacecraft in space. What was the biggest reason for launching in a \"launch window\"?", "correct": "So the shuttle could get into the right orbit", "options": ["So the shuttle didn't with any birds", "So the astronauts didn't get ill", "So the shuttle actually took off"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSo the shuttle could get into the right orbit.\n\n\tA launch window can last from minutes to hours, depending on weather and the location of the spacecraft. When simply launching into orbit, almost any time will do. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is true about NASA's launch site, Kennedy Space Center?", "correct": "It is a wildlife sanctuary", "options": ["It is on the grounds of a Civil War battle", "The area is as big as Rhode Island", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is a wildlife sanctuary.\n\n\tBefore each launch, park rangers take to the nearby fields surrounding the launch pad to remove all birds and animals that have a home nearby. They remove the creatures by using foghorns, or offering food to lure them away. Some animals found in the area are the bald eagle, American alligator, Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake, and Florida panther. \n"}, {"text": "How close can onlookers come to the space shuttle during the launch?", "correct": "1 mile", "options": ["5 miles", "400 feet", "950 feet"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1 mile.\n\n\tWith the sheer sounds of a space shuttle launch, everyone in a one mile radius would die of the sound. That is another reason why all wildlife is removed from the area before takeoff. The closest people to a launch are firefighters, who are in a heavy-duty almost tank-like vehicle, so they would be a first responder if something went wrong during the launch. \n"}, {"text": "One thing to do before a launch is to make sure the astronauts are in! Has NASA ever launched an unmanned shuttle?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAll NASA-launched missions carried astronauts to their desired location, except for the two tragic shuttle crashes. STS 61-A carried the most out of all operations, taking 9 astronauts into space. X-37B was launched by the US Air Force, and stayed in orbit for 220 days before landing on its own. That mission happened in 2010. \n"}, {"text": "A pre-launch check involves lots of acronyms. One major part is the APU that needs to be checked. What is the APU?", "correct": "Auxiliary Power Unit", "options": ["Automatic Power Unit", "Audio Playback Unit", "Apu Nahasapeemapetilon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAuxiliary Power Unit.\n\n\tThe APU is checked with 5-10 minutes before. Astronauts need to make sure that the APU is set to certain levels for different parts of the shuttle. The two main parts controlled by the APU is the fuel tank and the hydraulics. \n"}, {"text": "Name one of the two elements which are found in a shuttle's external tank.", "correct": "Hydrogen & oxygen", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydrogen & oxygen.\n\n\tThe shuttle`s external tank appears as the red/orange \"cling-on\" to the shuttle. The external tank is released from the shuttle minutes after the launch. When a shuttle launches from Kennedy Space Center, it usually lands in the Atlantic Ocean about 120-180 km away from the launch site. One external tank (also called boosters) is 153 feet in length! \n"}, {"text": "What was the longest mission ever for a space shuttle?", "correct": "17 days", "options": ["11 days", "1 month", "7 months and 6 days"], "explanation": "\n\n\n17 days.\n\n\tSTS-80 Columbia lifted off on November 19, 1996 and landed 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes, and 18 seconds later on December 7. Bad weather prevented a landing for two days, to the seventh. It was the 21st mission for Columbia, which disintegrated upon re-entry in 2003. \n"}, {"text": "Each shuttle mission was given a name of STS-#, with the number being which shuttle launch it is. What does STS stand for?", "correct": "Space Transportation System", "options": ["Sequence of Takeoff Steps", "Systematical Takeoff Setup", "Space Takeoff Structure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpace Transportation System.\n\n\tSTS-1 was the first shuttle launch (Columbia) and went up in 1981. It was the original name for the Space Shuttle program. \n"}, {"text": "On average, how much money did it cost to launch a space shuttle?", "correct": "$450 million", "options": ["$10 million", "$1 billion", "$88 million"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$450 million.\n\n\tThe money is spent, among other things, on the equipment, as well as the gas the shuttle uses. They also need to pay salaries of all the astronauts as well as the crew members who stay on the ground. The cost to actually build a space shuttle is around $1.7 billion, which is what NASA spent on building the shuttle \"Endeavour\". \n"}, {"text": "When did NASA send up its final space shuttle, Atlantis, for the final time?", "correct": "July 8, 2011", "options": ["October 17, 2009", "April 20, 2011", "March 1, 2010"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuly 8, 2011.\n\n\tAtlantis launched for its 32nd mission and the 135th and final space shuttle mission. The main object of the final mission was to take supplies of food, clothing and other items to the International Space Station. \n"}]}
