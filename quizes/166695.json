", "correct": "Achernar", "options": ["Vega", "Castor", "Sirius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAchernar.\n\n\tAchernar is a blue dwarf star surrounded by helium gas. A dwarf star is a small star that is losing mass faster than the Sun. Achernar is surrounded by helium gas. Because it spins so quickly, the star's temperature is hard to determine. Because of the star's proximity to the South Pole, it can not be seen from the northern hemisphere. \n"}, {"text": "The name of this star in the sky means 'follower'. ", "correct": "Aldebaran", "options": ["Spica", "Rigel", "Alcrux"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAldebaran.\n\n\tAldebaran is a dark orange, normal giant star in the constellation Taurus. The sun passes to the north of Aldebaran in June. It has a surface temperature of 3,227 degrees Celsius. Being a normal giant star means Aldebaran is a large star with a long lifetime. Astronomers also refer to Aldebaran as a carbon star because it is made of carbon compounds. This star can only be seen in the Northern Hemisphere in Winter and in the Southern Hemisphere in Summer. \n"}, {"text": "This star is the tail of the constellation Cygnus. ", "correct": "Deneb", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeneb.\n\n\tDeneb has a temperature of 8,127 degrees Celsius. Because of Deneb's light blue color, it is classified as a luminous supergiant, a large star seen from anywhere in the sky. Deneb, Vega and Altair make up the Summer Triangle. Deneb can only be seen in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer and the Southern Hemisphere in the winter. \n"}, {"text": "Now this star is an easy one you see because it and its partner were nicknamed by the aborigines.", "correct": "Hadar", "options": ["Sirius", "Becrux", "Castor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHadar.\n\n\tHadar's scientific name is Beta Centauri. In 4,000 years, Alpha and Beta Centauri will come close to each other. Hadar makes the knee of the constellation Centaurus. Hadar is in the process of shutting down its hydrogen fusing and dying. Hadar and the partner star point to the Southern Cross. In Australia, the aborigine's refer to both stars as the twins that created the world. Hadar can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere during Spring and the Southern Hemisphere in Fall. \n"}, {"text": "'Mouth of a southern fish' is the meaning of this star's name.", "correct": "Fomalhaut", "options": ["Becrux", "Shaula", "Spica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFomalhaut.\n\n\tFomalhault is part of the constellation Pisces Austrinus. Hydrogen makes up the base of the star. Fomalhault is the youngest star close to Earth and has a hole in it. It can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere during the Fall and in the Southern Hemisphere during Spring. \n"}, {"text": "Capella is the name of this star, but can you guess what the name means?", "correct": "She-goat", "options": ["Twin", "Frog", "Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe-goat.\n\n\tCapella can be a white to dark yellow star famous for its two giant stars and two dwarf stars which make up this star. Capella is surrounded by a hydrogen gas and can be seen overhead during Winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere in the Summer. \n"}, {"text": "This star shares the name of a nasty tasting oil. ", "correct": "Castor", "options": ["Adhara", "Regulus", "Spica"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCastor.\n\n\tCastor has a strong helium gas surrounding it. Castor, the mortal twin, and his brother Pollux make up the Gemini constellation, who are famous for their journey with Jason on the Argos. Castor can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere during Winter and the Southern Hemisphere in the Summer. \n"}, {"text": "The name of this star in the sky shares its name with an Egyptian city.", "correct": "Canopus", "options": ["Betelgeuse", "Antares", "Shaula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanopus.\n\n\tCanada can't see Canopus. It is 7,572 degrees Celsius. The corona of this star is hotter than the sun's corona and is also magnetic.  This star can barely be seen in the Northern Hemisphere during Winter, but is very well seen from the Southern Hemisphere in the Summer. Because of this, Canopus is called the great star of the South. Because of the lack of hydrogen fusing in the core, Canopus is slowly dying. \n"}, {"text": "This star should be taken seriously because the name means scorching. ", "correct": "Sirius", "options": ["Spica", "Rigel", "Acrux"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSirius.\n\n\tIn Egypt, seeing Sirius in the sky once announced the rising of the Nile in the Egypt. Because of the movement of the Earth's axis, Sirius no longer announces the rising of the Nile. It is, however, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major. Sirius is also referred to as the dog star. Sirius can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere during Winter and the Southern Hemisphere in Summer. \n"}, {"text": "You wouldn't think of this as a star, but the Greeks called it Helios and the Romans refered to it as Sol.", "correct": "Sun", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSun.\n\n\tThe sun is a bright yellow star that is .000016 light years away from Earth. The sun is made of 75 percent hydrogen and 25 percent helium. If 109 Earths were stood side by side it would equal the diameter of the Sun. The star takes up 99.85 percent of the mass in the solar system. In electric company terms the sun is four hundred trillion watts and would cost the United States millions of years of the Gross National Product to keep it lit. \n"}]}
