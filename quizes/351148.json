{"id": "351148", "name": "\"Kingdom Hearts\" Worlds - In Other Words Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Video Games Wordplay", "Video Games In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "Islets of Fate", "correct": "Destiny Islands", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDestiny Islands.\n\n\tDestiny Islands is the very first world you encounter in \"Kingdom Hearts\".  This is where Sora has a dream (or was it real, you won't learn until later about this strange \"dream\").  The island is also the homeworld of Sora, Kairi, and Riku; in the beginning of the game they decide to leave.  Riku is swallowed by darkness, Kairi can't be found, and Sora wakes up in a different world.  Destiny Islands will be revisited closer to the end of the game as well. \n"}, {"text": "Pass Through City", "correct": "Traverse Town", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTraverse Town.\n\n\tWhen Sora wakes up after the Destiny Islands incident, he finds himself in an unknown world.  He is woken up by Pluto (Mickey Mouse' dog) in the alley of Traverse Town.  It is also in this world that Sora meets Donald and Goofy, and he happens to travel back to the town a lot throughout the game. \n"}, {"text": "Curious Nation", "correct": "Wonderland", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWonderland.\n\n\tWonderland; yes, it is the same place Alice finds herself in from Lewis Carroll's novels.  In this world, based on the Disney film \"Alice in Wonderland\", Sora meets Alice, who is on trial.  Sora decides to help her, which was a good idea, because Alice was a fairly important figure near the end of the game (you didn't think I'd tell you why, did you?). \n"}, {"text": "Greek Mountain Theater", "correct": "Coliseum & Colosseum & Olympus Coliseum & Olympus Colosseum", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nColiseum & Colosseum & Olympus Coliseum & Olympus Colosseum.\n\n\tIn the Olympus Coliseum level of the game, Sora meets Disney's Hercules, and enters the games that take place at the Coliseum.  The games are cut short, though, when Hades releases Cerberus to wreak havoc in the arena.  But do not worry, you may return to the Coliseum later in the game when it has been repaired of the damages. \n"}, {"text": "Far Down Forest", "correct": "Deep Jungle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeep Jungle.\n\n\tThe Deep Jungle is a world based on the Disney film \"Tarzan\".  Sora meets Tarzan, Jane, and Clayton (the baddie of the level), and befriends the gorillas.  Tarzan can even join Sora's party, replacing either Donald and Goofy.  He can be handy to have around, unless you're collecting Trinity Marks! \n"}, {"text": "Terrible Dogfish", "correct": "Monstro", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonstro.\n\n\tAlright, I confess; in \"Kingdom Hearts\" (as well as Disney's \"Pinocchio\"), it isn't really a Terrible Dogfish, but simply a whale.  However, since the film was based on the book with the \"Terrible Dogfish\" in it, and the film named this sea monster, they are synonymous enough.  ;-)\r Monstro swallows Sora and the group while they are flying in the Gummi Ship, and they must navigate their way through Monstro to find an exit.  They meet Gepetto along the way, and they save Pinocchio as well.  Once freed, Gepetto and Pinocchio retire to Traverse Town. \n"}, {"text": "All Hallow's Eve City", "correct": "Halloween Town", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalloween Town.\n\n\tHalloween Town is a world based on Tim Burton's \"Nightmare Before Christmas\".  In this world, Sora meets Jack Skellington, the well-known tall, slender skeletal figure from Burton's film.  He can join Sora's party, replacing either Donald or Goofy.  This world is revisited in \"Kingdom Hearts 2\", where Sora fights a house... But I won't give anything else away. \n"}, {"text": "Always in Flight", "correct": "Neverland", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeverland.\n\n\tSora makes his way to Captain Hook's ship in the Neverland world.  He meets Peter Pan and Tinkerbell as well, and is given the ability to fly, though only in Neverland.  Sora also visits the Clock Tower in London, another location from Disney's \"Peter Pan\".  Peter Pan can also join Sora's party, if you so choose. \n"}, {"text": "Empty Fortress", "correct": "Hollow Bastion", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHollow Bastion.\n\n\tHollow Bastion is the name of the world where you meet Beast, and rescue Belle from the dungeon.  The world is based off of the Disney film \"Beauty and the Beast\", though the storyline is not followed through as well as other levels of the game.  Beast is yet another member that can join your party, provided you don't mind getting rid of Donald or Goofy. \n"}, {"text": "Apocalypse", "correct": "End of the World", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnd of the World.\n\n\tThe End of the World world is very strange indeed; to begin, there is a maze you must walk through, but it's invisible.  It is tricky to navigate.  There are no enemies in the world at first, until you enter certain portals that take you back to certain locations of old worlds you once visited, where you must fight even more difficult bad guys than you had to fight the first time!  A huge boss battle also takes place in this world, with over a dozen boss fights in a row.\r Not for the faint at heart; it is recommended you be at least level 60 upon entering, though even at this point, it will be incredibly difficult.  Though not nearly as difficult as Sephiroth, but that's a different story. \n"}]}
