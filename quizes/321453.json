{"id": "321453", "name": "Better Late Than Never Trivia Game | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "Mixed Bag"], "questions": [{"text": "I'm in Germany and I'm here to participate in an event that marked the fall of the Iron Curtain.  As it turns out, I'm a couple decades too late.  What event did I miss?", "correct": "The collapse of the Berlin Wall", "options": ["Woodstock", "The end of the Vietnam War", "The signing of the Treaty of Versailles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe collapse of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\tThe Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 and it marked the fall of the Iron Curtain which separated the 'Eastern Bloc' (comprised of Eastern Europe and Russia) and the Western democratic side of Europe.  This disintegration began in Hungary a few months before the fall of the wall, but when this border came crashing down, it was a momentous triumph for freedom in history. With revolutions in many Eastern Bloc countries, the end of the Cold War was marked by this important razing.  I mean, I missed the whole thing (by a bit of a longshot), but there are still pieces of the wall to be found in Berlin (and even in the United States). \n"}, {"text": "I decide to set my alarm to arrive for the opening of the world's tallest tower.  When I get to the front doors, it turns out that I'm a bit tardy in my arrival in Chicago.  What is this 'world's tallest skyscraper' that I'm supposed to have visited in 1973?", "correct": "Sears Tower", "options": ["Empire State Building", "CN Tower", "Chrysler Building"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSears Tower.\n\n\tSears Tower (also known as the Willis Tower) passed the World Trade Center as the tallest building in the United States in the 1970s and temporarily became the world's tallest skyscraper until it was passed in 1998 by Kuala Lampur's Petronas Twin Towers.  While Sears originally made use of the tower for business purposes, they departed from this location in the mid-1990s.  The reason for its being named Willis Tower is because of Willis Group Holdings who occupy three floors of the structure. In 2010, the completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE surpassed all records held by the Chicago skyscraper. Turns out I missed that opening too ... \n"}, {"text": "Miffed by my luck, I decide to play it safe and board up my Ontario house in preparation for a hurricane heading up North America's eastern coast.  A neighbour spies me on my roof and I explain what I'm doing.  He tells me that the hurricane I'm preparing for already came and went (in 1954).  What was the name of this hurricane?", "correct": "Hurricane Hazel", "options": ["Hurricane Andrew", "Hurricane George", "Hurricane Katrina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHurricane Hazel.\n\n\tHurricane Hazel is notable in the regions around Toronto for its widespread flooding and damaging power.  The area north of Toronto, the Holland Marsh, was completely flooded, while local rivers heading all the way into cottage country overflowed.  Overall, over a hundred million dollars in damages were caused (equating to over a billion in costs by values half a century later).  Hazel started in the eastern Caribbean and progressed west, then north up the Eastern Coast of North America before ending near James Bay.  Due to the intensity of the storm and its effects on the region, over eighty fatalities were counted in Ontario as a result. Best to be prepared though; I finish boarding up my house anyways. \n"}, {"text": "I decide to head to the capital of Turkey in order to clear my head.  Dropping down in Istanbul, I decide to delve into the political side of the country and explore.  A local historian tells me that I'm not in the capital city at all.  Istanbul hasn't been the capital since 1923.  No one told me!  What did the capital become in 1923?", "correct": "Ankara", "options": ["Constantinople", "Izmir", "Konya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnkara.\n\n\tWell, we know that Istanbul was Constantinople, but Istanbul (and at one point Constantinople) was once the capital of Turkey (and before that it was New Rome and Byzantium).  In 1923, Istanbul, one of the largest cities in the world (and the largest in Turkey) stepped aside, and Ankara became the country's capital city. Rich in history, the city features the central government of Turkey and, like Istanbul, has suffered from a history of name changes.  Originally, the city was known as Ankuwash.  While the city of Ankara is in central Turkey, Istanbul stands on the cusp of the European part of the country at the edge of the Bosporus. \n"}, {"text": "I cancel plans to visit Indonesia with my travel agent claiming that I caught word of this giant volcano erupting on an island near Sumatra; they say it's a big one.  The travel agent assures me that everything's okay - the volcano hasn't erupted since 1883.  Confused, I decide not to take my chances.  What was the name of this intense geological event?", "correct": "The eruption of Krakatoa", "options": ["The eruption of Mount St. Helens", "The eruption of Mount Etna", "The eruption of Vesuvius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe eruption of Krakatoa.\n\n\tI seem to be getting worse with this stuff.  Now, my trip to Indonesia has to suffer.  Krakatoa sits between Sumatra and Java, two of Indonesia's major islands.  The eruption of this volcano was magnificent with the eruption being so loud that it was heard in Australia and Mauritius.  The earthquakes and subsequent eruption decimated the original island, shrinking it into a tiny version of what it once was. It was one of the deadliest volcanic eruptions ever with over thirty thousand fatalities.  Indonesia also holds the most deadly volcano record for its 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora which killed three times the number of people. \n"}, {"text": "I decide to head to the coast of Britain to await the arrival of Charles Darwin who, returning from the Galapagos Islands, is supposed to have some important new theories.  I get to the end of the pier and I'm told that Darwin came and went in 1836.  What ship did he arrive on?", "correct": "HMS Beagle", "options": ["HMS Britannia", "HMS Pinafore", "HMS Vulcan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHMS Beagle.\n\n\tA Royal Navy ship, the Beagle eventually became a survey ship.  Its second voyage took Darwin to the Galapagos Island where he made some important observations and theories about evolution.  Sending letters back to Britain at port cities, his findings were met with mixed praise and criticisms.  Nonetheless, his theories on natural selection proved to be influential in the biological science community and they jilted religious beliefs worldwide.  Though Darwin disembarked from the boat in 1836 (and I missed it) he left Britain on the same boat in 1831 to begin his journey. \n"}, {"text": "Sitting on a train and reading a newspaper, I come across something odd.  \"Somebody bought Louisiana?\" I exclaim.  Somebody pulls me aside and explains that I don't need to think about it- it happened ages ago ... and what the heck am I so worried about.  In what year did the Louisiana Purchase occur?", "correct": "1803", "options": ["1774", "1825", "1901"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1803.\n\n\tThe United States purchased the area known as Louisiana (named after Louis XIV) in 1803 in order to expand westward.  The purchase cost S11.25 million (in addition to a lifting of US debts to France debts totaling an additional eighteen million francs).  As a result, the United States grew towards the Pacific. The amount of land acquired comprises nearly a quarter of surface area of the country.  The Louisiana Purchase was completed during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson.  It would be another forty years before the States had claimed Texas.  Somebody really needs to tell me about these things ... I would've put up a bid if I'd have known about it earlier. \n"}, {"text": "I decide to wait in front of my local bookstore overnight anticipating a coming new release.  In the morning, the shopkeeper opens the front door and asks me what I'm doing.  When I mention the title of the book, she says it's been out for ages ... since 1762 in fact.  I pick up my copy of \"Emile\" and depart.  Who wrote this important philosophical book \"On Education\"?", "correct": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "options": ["John Locke", "Mikhail Bakhtin", "Voltaire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\n\tWhile Rousseau (and many others) regarded \"Emile\" as his most important and most influential work, the book was heavily criticized in its day for its views on children and society.  It essentially states Rousseau's views that the child does not retain the innocence it is born with, losing it due to the corruption placed upon it by civilization. This, of course, opposes the Puritan views of the child in which kids were given harsh moral lessons in order to inherit goodness (as children were inherently not innocent upon birth).  The book had a major effect on education practices in the years that followed. \n"}, {"text": "I head to Massachusetts to prepare for my next activity.  Getting my pitchfork and shabby clothing, I head to the streets shouting \"Burn the witches!\"  A citizen takes me aside to tell me that they don't do that anymore - they haven't killed a witch since 1693.  Great.  Now I look like a fool.  What city am I in?", "correct": "Salem", "options": ["Quincy", "Hyannisport", "Gloucester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalem.\n\n\tMassachusetts in the late 17th century may not have been the safest place, but I vow to keep our current century the same way!  The Salem witch trials are a notable part of the state's history, and it's another instance in which the Puritan views have been raised in outrage.  For fear of devilish deals and the supernatural, the residents of Salem and surrounding towns cried out and killed twenty people in the trials (imprisoning many more).  The witches were tried in a court of law, and a number of men and women were hanged. All of these accusations began a year earlier when two girls received unexplainable symptoms which could be attributed to no diseases. \n"}, {"text": "I realize something: we really need to restrict the power held by the King (of England).  I stop myself this time.  Is there a King of England right now?  This time I look it up online; they did this with King John and the Magna Carta.  That saved me the trouble of writing an angry letter or flying to the UK.  In what century was the Magna Carta signed?", "correct": "13th century", "options": ["14th century", "12th century", "15th century"], "explanation": "\n\n\n13th century.\n\n\tThe Magna Carta, or the Great Charter, was monumental in shaping law in Europe.  The signing of this document allowed the people of England to sleep better at night as it ensured that the King could not go beyond the extent of the law in his reign, using unlawful imprisonment, for example.  Numerous copies of this vow were made to spread across England and the territories held by the British Empire.  There is no single master copy left in existence and the original was scribed in Latin. \n"}]}
