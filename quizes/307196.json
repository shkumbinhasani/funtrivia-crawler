Having just lost his parents in a car accident, he has been sent to this tiny town to live with his Uncle Jonathan in Barnavelt's Folly, a large mansion at the top of a hill.  Here, he meets the neighbour, Mrs. Zimmermann, and they play poker before Lewis is sent off to bed.  During the night, Lewis recalls his odd first day in town and finds it odd that his uncle has a fascination with clocks; the house is full of them.  Additionally, his uncle stops in silence every time a clock chimes, from the ones in the house to the large clocktower in the middle of town.\rIn the middle of the night, while Lewis reads in his new bed, he hears his uncle walking down the hall with a flashlight.  As he watches his uncle pacing up and down the corridor, the man oddly pounds on the wall with his flashlight, much to Lewis' confusion. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the previous owner of Uncle Jonathan's house?", "correct": "Issac Izard", "options": ["Henry Zimmermann", "Christian Rousseau", "John Howard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIssac Izard.\n\n\tLewis takes his first three weeks in New Zebedee to explore and finds that it's hard to take it all in so quickly.  Upon exploring certain parts of the Barnavelt house, he realizes that there are a few uncanny things including a mirror that depicts the image of a jungle and odd, changing stained glass windows. One night, Lewis sneaks out of his room to find Uncle Jonathan turning off all of the clocks in the house.  Jonathan explains that the house was once owned by Issac Izard, a self-proclaimed warlock who knew magic and lived in the mansion with his wife.  When Issac died and Jonathan bought the house, he discovered that a ticking noise could be heard in the walls. Jonathan eventually got annoyed by this and bought many other clocks so as to drown out the ticking sound.  He also notes that he also knows a bit of parlor magic while Mrs. Zimmermann actually went to school to become a witch/warlock herself.  As he mentions this, Mrs. Zimmermann enters the kitchen through a secret passage and ushers them both off to bed. \n"}, {"text": "After Lewis meets Tarby, he tells his new friend that Jonathan can do which of these things?", "correct": "Eclipse the moon", "options": ["Eclipse the sun", "Tilt the Earth upside-down", "Stop the Earth from spinning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEclipse the moon.\n\n\tOne day after school begins, Lewis goes to an empty baseball diamond to practice his pitching and hitting.  When the popular kid in school, Tarby, appears and helps him out, Lewis finds a friend in him.  Tarby, although he has a broken arm, does the best he can to teach Lewis and inevitably, Lewis tries to pay him back by telling him that his uncle can eclipse the moon, something Jonathan said he could do in passing. Tarby doesn't believe him, but comes over for a demonstration when Jonathan agrees to do it.  On the night of the full moon, they gather outside and Jonathan performs the task in the birdbath. Soon, a black ooze covers the moon and the backyard magically comes to life.  While Lewis and Tarby marvel at this illusion, Tarby realizes that Lewis was right about the magic after all.  He seems detached and Lewis thinks that it may be because Tarby was proven wrong.  After spending a bit of time in Mrs. Zimmermann's purple-filled house, Tarby goes home. \n"}, {"text": "On Halloween, Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann show Lewis which of these events?", "correct": "The Battle of Waterloo", "options": ["The War of 1812", "The French Revolution", "The Battle of Hastings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo.\n\n\tAs baseball season winds down and Tarby's arm heals, Lewis sees less and less of his only friend, and he fears that he may lose him.  One day, while out at the cemetery, Lewis claims that his uncle can raise the dead (though he doesn't know this for sure).  Tarby claims that Jonathan might not be able to do this, but he instead hypnotized them the last time.  Lewis then states that he can try to raise the dead to prove that the magic exists, and Tarby tells him to do it.  Over the next few days, Lewis looks into his uncle's library and reads the \"Necronomicon\", learning the chants and incantations necessary to raise the dead.\rOn Halloween night, when the boys are set to meet at midnight in the cemetery, Lewis takes an early dinner and goes to Mrs. Zimmermann's to view a show.  For this, they sit him at the fireplace and ask him what he wants to see.  He begins with the Spanish Armada, and the two create an illusion of the Spanish Armada returning home, which Lewis witnesses.  He then asks to see the Battle of Waterloo, and because he has control, Lewis lets Napoleon win.  After this bout of magic, Jonathan suggests they go to bed, so they depart. \n"}, {"text": "What name appears on the sheet of paper Lewis uses at the cemetery?", "correct": "Selenna", "options": ["Jonathan", "Florence", "Barnavelt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelenna.\n\n\tAt midnight, Lewis quickly rushes to the cemetery to meet Tarby who is already there.  With a piece of chalk and a piece of paper, Lewis draws a circle within a circle and unknowingly begins chanting.  When another force makes him spell out the name 'Selenna' on the page, the two are shocked to find the door to a nearby tomb breaking its lock and slowly opening. As the doors creak ajar, a grey light emanates from within and a black ooze slowly spreads from the entrance.  The two quickly run from the graveyard and back home.  Lewis falls down on the way back and accidentally loses the flashlight, but nonetheless, at three in the morning, he gets home. When he falls to sleep, he has cryptic dreams of bones and clocks.  Upon waking up, he hears the ticking of the clock in the walls. \n"}, {"text": "How do Lewis, Jonathan, and Mrs. Zimmermann escape the car pursuing them outside town?", "correct": "They cross a bridge", "options": ["They drive along back roads", "They turn off their headlights", "They hide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey cross a bridge.\n\n\tVandals are soon blamed for destroying the lock on the tomb in the graveyard, and while Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann don't suspect Lewis, they think about his detachment the previous day.  After Lewis discovers that the tomb belongs to Issac Izard, Jonathan suggests that the three of them go out for a car ride in the country.  They end up spending most of the day out and about and realize that it's getting quite late.  As they turn around to return to New Zebedee, they find that a car is following them and gaining.  Quickly, they speed back home, but upon crossing a bridge outside the town's limits, they find that the car following can not cross it due to the supernatural forces within.  Mrs. Zimmermann explains that this old witch's trick saved them.\rWhen they return to Barnavelt's Folly, Jonathan notices that all the lights in the house have been opened and one of these contained a clock key which has now gone missing. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the family that lived across from Jonathan?", "correct": "The Hanchetts", "options": ["The Thomsons", "The Blairs", "The Gilligans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hanchetts.\n\n\tOne day soon after the car chase ordeal, Jonathan and Lewis find that the neighbours across the street have put their house up for sale.  When Jonathan speaks with them, they blame him for misusing magic and causing them to need to leave New Zebedee for good.\rA moving truck arrives one day and Lewis speaks with the driver, a homeless man in town known as Hammerhandle, who tells him to stay out of the new family's business.  Frightened, Lewis rushes to his uncle to tell him, and Jonathan has a talk with the man.  Later, he tells Lewis to stay away from them.\rThat night, Lewis looks out his window to see the lights on in the house across the street.  He watches as a man wearing spectacles walks in and out of the house and he wonders. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Lewis' deceased aunt?", "correct": "Mattie", "options": ["Judy", "Tracy", "Ingrid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMattie.\n\n\tOne night, Lewis wakes up to hear the door being knocked upon.  When he opens it, he is shocked to find that his deceased Aunt Mattie is standing there.  He faints, and when he wakes up he finds that the eerie apparition has disappeared.\rChristmas comes and goes, and one day shortly after, Lewis decides to play a pipe organ in the parlor.  Upon discovering that some of the blocks in the pipes can be removed, he reaches in and finds notes from Isaac Izard, one of which prophesies doomsday in the form of a clock.  That night, Lewis hides in the secret passageway behind the china cupboard in the kitchen and listens to his uncle and Mrs. Zimmermann talk about the prophecy.  They note that the Izards (specifically Isaac) watched the clouds and skies to predict doomsday.  When he made the clock, he did not have the power to wind it, though his wife probably could have.  Lewis realizes that the clock within the walls, the terrible ticking, could potentially bring about the end of the world, and they have all the reason to believe that the people across the street are, in fact, the Izards. \n"}, {"text": "When Lewis investigates the house across the road, he gets caught by the owner.  Who helps him escape?", "correct": "Mrs. Zimmermann", "options": ["Jonathan", "Tarby", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMrs. Zimmermann\n\n\tWorried about the future, Lewis tries to find Tarby, the only other person to know about the cemetery ordeal.  When he comes across him playing baseball with the other boys, Tarby treats him badly and they nearly fight.  Lewis walks home crying and realizes that he must be brave to help everyone.  Taking Jonathan's magic cane from the front door, he walks across the street and enters the open door in the house across. Looking inside, he finds that everything is spotlessly clean and walking up the stairs, he finds a picture of Isaac Izard on the wall.  Realizing that Mrs. O'Meagher is in fact Mrs. Izard, he turns to leave but finds that she is blocking his exit. Mrs. Zimmermann appears as well though, and using her magic she forces Selenna upstairs and, as she puts it, destroys her.  Lewis runs outside into Uncle Jonathan's arms and Mrs. Zimmermann tells them that this is their opportunity to find the clock in the walls. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Lewis find the clock in Barnavelt's Folly?", "correct": "In a coal bin", "options": ["In the attic", "In the pipe organ", "In the floorboards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a coal bin.\n\n\tReturning to the house, Mrs. Zimmermann and Jonathan realize that the only way to stop the Izards is to let Lewis create a crazy ritual that defies all rituals of dark magic.  They send the boy on his way and he returns with a nonsensical list of tasks ranging from playing the pipe organ to playing poker until they get a magical, non-existent card, then reading a magic 8 ball to reveal the location of the clock.  When Lewis reads it, they find that it is within the coal bin in the basement.  Here, they clear out the coal and find a fake wall guarding a locked door.  Before Jonathan can use a spell to open it, it opens on its own and they look inside to find the mysterious clock.  Before they can reach it though, Selenna Izard, now regenerated, forces paralysis on Mrs. Zimmermann and Jonathan.  Lewis, realizing this, stays facing away from Selenna, runs to the clock, and throws it onto the ground, breaking it and stopping the doomsday device.  Selenna slowly disintegrates into ash and the spell is broken.\rIn the coming days, Jonathan learns that it was Lewis who raised the dead in the cemetery (he left the flashlight there on Halloween), but the ashes were replaced and a magical lock was placed on the gate to the tomb.  On the bright side, the ticking in the house has stopped. \n"}]}
