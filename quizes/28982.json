Which of these painters was responsible for this masterpiece?", "correct": "Masaccio", "options": ["Raphael", "Giotto", "Tintoretto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasaccio.\n\n\tMasaccio possibly partnered with Masolino in creating this very early work of the Renaissance.  Sloppy Tom, as they called him because he dressed so funny, was the first painter to understand and apply Brunelleschi's principles of scientific perspective. \n"}, {"text": "In the history of art there are a number of 'crossover' artists from other professions.  Which of these poets painted the Biblical work 'Jacob's Dream'?", "correct": "Blake", "options": ["Rosetti", "Poe", "Dante"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlake.\n\n\tWilliam Blake was not only one of England's great Romantic poets, he also dabbled profusely in the world of painting!  Only well after Blake's death was he recognized as a painter of genius, thanks to the promotion of his work by the Pre-Raphaelites. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these great artists of the Renaissance painted 'Madonna della Misericordia'?", "correct": "Piero della Francesca", "options": ["Raphael", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Tintoretto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiero della Francesca.\n\n\tPiero della Francesca is one of my favorite early Renaissance painters.  His very early command of perspective sets him apart from most of the other painters working during his generation.  The 'Madonna della Misericordia' was commissioned in 1445, but he did not complete this polyptych (his first recorded work) until much later. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these epic French artists painted the 'Fury of Medea'?", "correct": "Delacroix", "options": ["Ingres", "David", "Rousseau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDelacroix.\n\n\tDelacroix was perhaps the greatest painter of the Romantic period of French history.  His giant-sized works are stunningly exhibited in the Louvre and elsewhere.  Delacroix's father was the politician Charles Delacroix, though some historians believe that the famed French diplomat Tallyrand was actually his dad! \n"}, {"text": "Who painted 'Death and the Maiden' and was kicked out of Krumau for pornography?", "correct": "Egon Schiele", "options": ["Pablo Picasso", "Klimt", "Gustave Moureau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgon Schiele.\n\n\tSchiele was a student of the Vienna Academy and became an adherent to the Art Nouveau style while studying there with Klimt.  He turned to his own style later which was often characterized by rather erotic female nudes.  His paintings were burned and he was jailed for a time, and he died in the great flu epidemic of 1918.  He was only 28 years old, how sad!  I hope you have enjoyed this quiz...thank you for playing it! \n"}]}
