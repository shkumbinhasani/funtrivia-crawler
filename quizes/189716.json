The two doctors agree to help Ames out by putting him on a strict regimen of diet and exercise.  How many pounds do they claim they can help Ames lose in 10 days?", "correct": "20 lbs", "options": ["10 lbs", "5 lbs", "2 lbs"], "explanation": "\n\n\n20 lbs.\n\n\tAmes has to lose 20 lbs in 10 days if he wishes to remain in the army.  Hawkeye and BJ begin by restricting Ames' diet.  Hawkeye removes a massive tray of food that Ames has prepared to eat, and they also deny Ames the pleasure of finishing the leftover chipped beef. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger hears of Ames' trouble and has a brilliant idea.  He plans to eat his way out of the army by gaining a quick 60 lbs.  In pursuit of this ridiculous goal, what food item does Klinger 'overdose' on during the episode?", "correct": "Salami", "options": ["Eggs", "Cheese", "Liver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalami.\n\n\tKlinger embarks on a strict diet of Lebanese salami, a meat which apparently has a very unique aroma.  By the end of the episode Klinger has eaten enough to upset his stomach.  He claims that he has consumed fully 10 salamis, and, knowing Klinger, there is little reason to doubt this claim!  Klinger calls his program 'food for freedom', while Potter characterizes it as 'suicide by salame'. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter is particularly annoyed by the lack of fitness in his camp, and insists that the dwellers of the 4077th begin a strict program of exercise.

With approximately 10 people pushing, they are unable to complete this task.  It falls to four M.P.s to turn the ambulance upright, a task they perform with intimidating ease.  Afterward, Potter insists on the people under his command getting in shape, and this ultimately leads to the formulation of his 'M*A*S*H Olympics' idea. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Potter devises a very clever plan to force the 4077th personnel to get in shape.  The M*A*S*H will hold its own Olympics, with Hawkeye and BJ as the two team captains.  After the Colonel's announcement, BJ and Hawkeye make a friendly bet.  What will the loser have to do for the winner for a week?", "correct": "Push him around in a wheelchair", "options": ["Wash his dirty socks", "Pull double shift duty in the post-op", "Bring him breakfast in bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPush him around in a wheelchair.\n\n\tHawkeye initially insists on being worshipped at his throne, but since a wheelchair is the closest thing to a throne at the 4077th the eventual idea suggested by BJ (to be pushed around in a wheelchair) wins out.  In the end, BJ and Hawkeye push Ames in the wheelchair when he announces he will be allowed to stay in the army after losing 20 lbs. \n"}, {"text": "Several events are included in the M*A*S*H Olympics, including a harrowing crutch race.

Margaret wins by ably navigating herself through the treacherous field and avoiding any physical confrontation. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger is forced to bow out of the M*A*S*H Olympics after having eaten himself to the point of sickness.

Which event does Donald help BJ's team win?", "correct": "Shoulder ride race", "options": ["Three-legged race", "Potato sack race", "Egg tossing contest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShoulder ride race.\n\n\tDonald (played by Mike Henry, a different actor than in Donald's previous appearance) carries Margaret on his shoulders and runs to victory over all competition.

P. Morgan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaddy Warbucks.\n\n\tHawkeye always enjoys a good cut, and couldn't resist making light of Charles' wealth and egotism.

Charles responds by calling Donald 'Donny'. \n"}, {"text": "The final event is the M*A*S*H obstacle course.  The two competitors are Sergeant Ames and Donald.  Donald easily wins this cometition over the inept Ames.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAmes is indeed inept, and Donald should easily have won the event, but he decides to show off to the crowd and runs himself into some netting, allowing Ames to pass him and win the obstacle course and the M*A*S*H Olympic games for Hawkeye's team.  Needless to say, Margaret is extremely peeved (see next question). \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Donald are finally able to have some vacation time together.

The two of them leave the 4077th at the end of the episode angry and bickering...the beginning of the end to their relationship.\r Thank you for having tried this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
