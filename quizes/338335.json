Over time, this function developed into what we now often understand as the duties of the Herald.  The incorrect answers above were the additional duties that had developed by around the 14th Century.  To enable the Herald to perform his duty effectively, he had to be able to recognise men from the devices displayed on their shields and flags. In the modern world, Heralds still appear at State Occasions, but their role has now taken on a more genealogical function.  Heralds were recently involved in the designing of the new Arms for Kate Middleton's family prior to her recent marriage to Prince William, now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. \n"}, {"text": "True heraldry has been defined as \"The systematic use of hereditary devices centered on the shield\".
