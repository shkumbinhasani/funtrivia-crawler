{"id": "245900", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'The Sniper' Multiple Choice Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of the episode, Hawkeye and Trapper are relaxing in the Swamp when Frank walks in.  Immediately, Frank begins fiddling around with his favorite pistol, much to his tentmates' chagrin.  What special feature does Frank's handgun have?", "correct": "Pearl handles", "options": ["Telescopic sighting mechanism", "Silencer", "Snakeskin holster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPearl handles.\n\n\tThe last thing Hawkeye and Trapper want in the Swamp is a handgun, or a tentmate with a handgun fetish.  Frank insists that he must have his sidearm, them being only three miles from the frontlines.  Margaret's reaction to Frank's gun is completely different.  She admires the pearl handles, claiming her father had a pistol just like it. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is planning a lovely picnic with a new nurse in camp.  What delicious sounding sandwiches has Radar prepared for Hawkeye and his new nurse friend?", "correct": "Breaded veal", "options": ["Braised liver", "Tuna surprise", "Anchovy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreaded veal.\n\n\tWhen Hawkeye learns that his sandwiches are breaded veal, he adds 'with yesterday's lettuce'.  Trapper quickly adds in a sardonic tone, 'And tomorrow's bananas'.  Colonel Blake's contribution to Hawkeye's afternoon out...a tiny bit of brandy. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye is very fortunate on this particular date.  His latest object d'amour is the lovely Lt. Suzanne Marquette, the newest nurse to make the rounds at the 4077th.  What actress that appeared in 'Tootsie' played this key role?", "correct": "Teri Garr", "options": ["Jessica Lange", "Geena Davis", "Ellen Foley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeri Garr.\n\n\tThat's right, *the* Oscar-nominated Teri Garr of 'Young Frankenstein', 'Oh, God!', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Mr. Mom' fame.  This is her one and only appearance on 'M*A*S*H'. \n"}, {"text": "Just when the 4077th seems at its most idyllic, a deadly sniper arrives and ruins the party.  When the sniper fires off his first few rounds at the camp, which of these is not hit by one of his bullets?", "correct": "Klinger's dress", "options": ["A football", "A basketball standard", "A P.A. speaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger's dress.\n\n\tThe sniper seems deadly accurate, but not particularly interested in actually shooting people.  The only person who apparently is shot by the sniper is the ambulance driver, played 'M*A*S*H' semi-regular Dennis Troy. \n"}, {"text": "Where are Colonel Blake and Radar exactly when the shooting begins?", "correct": "Shower tent", "options": ["Rosie's Bar", "Henry's office", "The latrine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShower tent.\n\n\tHenry dispatches Radar from the tent in order that the lad may get to the office, but the sniper turns Radar right back around towards the showers.  In one very short instance that I'd rather forget, you can actually see Radar's rear end as his towel falls off! \n"}, {"text": "With all of the officers at camp finally assembled in the office, various potential solutions to the sniper problem are discussed.  With wounded waiting in an ambulance right outside the door, what officer suggests surrender?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Trapper", "Frank", "Hot Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tFrank and Hot Lips are very gung ho, as one can imagine.  Hawkeye is more sensible, realizing that the 4077th doesn't have the immediate firepower to overcome a sniper (or snipers), he suggests waving a white flag so that the wounded can be gathered into the operating room.  Henry is against it, suggesting that he can't surrender without orders, but he finally relents. \n"}, {"text": "Still trapped in the office, Radar and Colonel Blake chat a bit.  Radar is very hungry, citing his high metabolism.  What happens to Radar if he doesn't eat, according to the lad?", "correct": "Everything solid in him turns to liquid", "options": ["He begins foaming at the mouth and barking at the moon", "His sense of reason completely fails", "He starts acting like his Aunt Bernice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEverything solid in him turns to liquid.\n\n\tTo emphasize his predicament, Radar claims that shoes are already full of water.  An incredulous Henry listens on half attentively, as always. \n"}, {"text": "While the rest of the camp keeps low and snoozes the night away, Frank has taken it upon himself to hunt down the sniper.  Hawkeye, who has gone out looking for Frank, finds him huddled and frightened.  What does Frank claim is his problem?", "correct": "He has subnormal eyesight at night", "options": ["He can't feel anything from the waist down", "He's hypoglycemic and has lost his energy", "He's developing a mild case of frostbite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has subnormal eyesight at night.\n\n\tThe cowardly Frank was cajoled by Hot Lips into seeking out the sniper, but he didn't get far, only a couple feet away from the post-op ward. \n"}, {"text": "Bravely, a frightened Hawkeye, followed closely by an even more frightened Frank, enter the mess tent where they have heard some noises.  It turns out that Radar has snuck some food and has made himself an awful sounding sandwich.  Which of these is not one of the sandwich's ingredients?", "correct": "Sardines", "options": ["Ketchup", "Butter", "Lettuce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSardines.\n\n\tProving once again that his appetite is simply insatiable, Radar has made himself a Ketchup on rye with butter and lettuce.  The sniper problem has not been solved, but at least Radar won't melt entirely into a puddle of liquid. \n"}, {"text": "The following afternoon, a chopper finally comes and rids the 4077th of its sniper problem, firing away with a submachine gun.  Does anyone accompany Hawkeye towards the sniper to check if he is still alive?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe brave and noble Hawkeye makes his way on his own to check the sniper, who has waved a white flag.  It turns out that he has survived, and in fact believed that he had come upon MacArthur's headquarters.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
