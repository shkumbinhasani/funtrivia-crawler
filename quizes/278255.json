{"id": "278255", "name": "\"Sly 2\" - \"A Starry Eyed Encounter\" (PS2) Multiple Choice Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 2: Band of Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin, in each level you are able to collect 30 bottles to open a secret vault.  Where is this vault located?", "correct": "In the sewers", "options": ["In the hotel", "Rajan's office", "On a rooftop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the sewers.\n\n\tIn order to get to the vault, you must go through the sewers to a secret room where the vault is.  The vault is in the same room as a lever you use to give Bentley and Murray access, so you can't access the vault until that mission comes.  Don't worry if you don't have all the bottles before entering.  Once you enter, the vault will be put on your camera so you can always see where it is, and you can enter the sewer for it at any time after the mission is over. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the levels, you collect several objects and return them to the hideout for loot.  How much do you get from the ming vase?", "correct": "Two hundred forty-nine coins", "options": ["Three hundred forty-nine coins", "One hundred forty-nine coins", "Forty-nine coins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo hundred forty-nine coins.\n\n\tThe ming vase is one of several items you can trade in for loot.  If you get it back in one piece, that is.  Some pieces are booby trapped, however.  This means you have to get them back within a certain amount of time before they explode.  Watch out for these ones; they can be the trickiest to get. \n"}, {"text": "During the party you take some recon photos.  Which of these does not appear at this party?", "correct": "Dimitri", "options": ["Contessa", "Jean Bison", "Arpeggio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDimitri.\n\n\tYou have already fought and won against Dimitri, remember?  He has already been captured and put in jail.  He wasn't at the party.  Jean Bison is a later bad guy you come across in Canada.  The Contessa is a secret undercover cop who has her own prison, but you fight her in two levels later, too.  Arpeggio is the main bad guy, and you fight him in the very last level. \n"}, {"text": "How many arms are on the statue that the Clockwerk wings are attached to?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Eight", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tThis statue has six arms, and has had the Clockwerk wings welded on the back.

The code unlocks the security door to a room you pull the lever of so Murray and Bentley can get out.

The insanity strike confuses your enemies with a simple tap of the cane.  They are confused and begin attacking each other so you can make an escape, or get through them easier. \n"}, {"text": "How many levels of access does Bentley hack through on the computers?", "correct": "Six", "options": ["Four", "Five", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSix.\n\n\tBentley has six levels to break through, which doesn't take too long, but you must defend him as Murray while he does so.
