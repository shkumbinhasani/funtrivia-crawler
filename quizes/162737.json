R. R. Tolkien", "The Return of the King"], "questions": [{"text": "As 'The Return of the King' starts out, we encounter Gandalf riding upon his great steed Shadowfax across the plain of Rohan towards Gondor.  Crossing into An\u00f3rien, territory of Gondor, Gandalf speedily transports his passenger Pippin towards which great citadel occupied by the steward of Gondor?  ", "correct": "Minas Tirith", "options": ["Rivendell", "Cair Andros", "Pelargir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMinas Tirith.\n\n\tMinas Tirith is a seven-tiered city only a short distance from the land of Mordor.  Within Minas Tirith resides Denethor, Steward of Gondor and father to both Boromir and Faramir.  Pippin marvels at the awesome nature of the city, but recognizes that beneath the magnificent fa\u00e7ade lies a city under great peril...the dark forces of Mordor have been pounding at the gates. \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf and Pippin arrive at the great Gondorian citadel with much fanfare, and are quickly transported into the upper levels of the massive city to meet the Steward of Gondor, Denethor.  Denethor's family has, for many generations, held power in Gondor in place of the rightful king.  Who was Denethor's father?  ", "correct": "Ecthelion", "options": ["Damrod", "Mithrandir", "Erkenbrand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEcthelion.\n\n\tEcthelion II was the father of the troubled Denethor, who has been driven mad by the death of his favorite son Boromir.  Ecthelion II should not be confused with Ecthelion I, a more distant ancestor, for whom the highest tower of Minas Tirith was named (the Tower of Ecthelion). \n"}, {"text": "Denethor appears rather unhappy to Pippin and Gandalf, something has obviously gone awry.  We quickly discover that Denethor has indeed learnt of the death of his eldest son Boromir.  How is it that he has come to such news?  ", "correct": "The horn of Gondor, formerly in Boromir's possession, has returned", "options": ["Pippin blurted out the news upon his arrival at the citadel, and it leaked to Denethor", "Denethor viewed Boromir's death through his Palant\u00edr", "An eye-witness of the battle has returned the news to Denethor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe horn of Gondor, formerly in Boromir's possession, has returned.\n\n\tDenethor found the horn, cleft in two, floating in the River Anduin some days after the horn had been sounded by Boromir.  Such a possession would not be given up lightly; Denethor knew clearly that his eldest son would only drop the horn upon his death.  Denethor beseeches Pippin to tell him a heroic story of his son's demise, which Pippin does reluctantly, but with great skill. \n"}, {"text": "After taking leave of Denethor, Pippin, walking solo through the tower complex and feeling lonely, happens upon one of the guards of the citadel.  Who is this upright man that quickly befriends our diminutive friend?  ", "correct": "Beregond", "options": ["Hasufel", "Valandil", "Dervorin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeregond.\n\n\tPippin meets Beregond, son of Baranor, on his way to the stable where he is to see after Gandalf's mighty steed Shadowfax.  An ordinary citizen of Gondor, Beregond is fascinated by Pippin's stories, and has never heard of people such as Aragorn or races such as hobbits. \n"}, {"text": "In conversation with his new-found friend, Pippin learns of the great danger that the men of Gondor face.  Orc armies of Mordor have been advancing slowly toward the land of men, especially attacking an ancient fortress that lies on either side of Anduin.  What is this fortress called?  ", "correct": "Osgiliath", "options": ["Aglaren", "Caladhras", "Meduseld"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOsgiliath.\n\n\tOsgiliath is the crossing point on the Anduin from Mordor to Minas Tirith, and hence has extremely high strategic importance.  An ancient city of men, it was taken at some point by the evil armies of Mordor, but then retaken by the men of Gondor during Denethor's youth.  Now, it once again has come under attack by the orc armies; a battle that can be viewed from the not-so-distant towers of Minas Tirith. \n"}, {"text": "After an interesting meal in which much information is passed between Pippin and his new acquaintance, Pippin is sent to meet a young lad, the son of the guard he has befriended.  What is the name of this child, with whom Pippin has an amusing encounter?  ", "correct": "Bergil", "options": ["Finrod", "Thengil", "Dori"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBergil.\n\n\tPippin is sent to meet Bergil, son of Beregond, and locates him near the Great Gate on Lampwrights' Street.  Bergil confronts Pippin and directs a barrage of questions towards the strange little cahracter.  Pippin tells Bergil that he is 29 years old and from the Shire.  Bergil cannot believe that Pippin is so old and yet so short (he compares heights and finds that he is nearly a foot taller than the hobbit), and suggests that he could stand Pippin on his head, or lay him on his back.  Pippin stands up proudly for himself, showing his valor, and the 10-year old decides that friendship is a better policy! \n"}, {"text": "In chapter two, the story returns away from Pippin and Gandalf to Aragorn and company.  Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are still in Rohan with the king and his riders, but wish to direct themselves soon towards Gondor and the impending conflict.

", "correct": "Hasufel", "options": ["Bregalad", "Meneldil", "Ufthak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHasufel.\n\n\tSoon enough Aragorn will make his return to Minas Tirith to help defend the citadel against the orc hordes of Mordor, but it won't be upon Hasufel.  He will soon be returned his own steed, called Roheryn, by the D\u00fanedain.  Gimli and Legolas once again announce their intention to accompany Aragorn on his journey, wherever it may take them...even into the Paths of the Dead! \n"}, {"text": "Along their way, Aragorn and company are met by a host of rangers (or D\u00fanedain) led by Halbarad, Aragorn's closest kinsman.

", "correct": "Elrond", "options": ["Denethor", "Galadriel", "Tom Bombadil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElrond.\n\n\tElrond's son Elrohir recites a message from his father Elrond that reads: 'The days are short.  If thou art in haste, remember the Paths of the Dead.'  Along with this chilling message, the sons of Elrond also bring a message from Arwen, along with a gift, which Aragorn chooses not to open up at the given moment (could it be a sword, hmm?) \n"}, {"text": "Aragorn has decided that his way lies along the Paths of the Dead, and he announces that all who follow him must do so of their own volition.  Naturally, the D\u00fanedain will follow him, along with Gimli and Legolas.  Where is the entrance gate to the dreaded paths to be found?  ", "correct": "Dunharrow", "options": ["Angrenost", "Calembel", "Imladris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDunharrow.\n\n\tAragorn has decided upon this dread decision as a result of two things, first the message of Elrond and second his having peered into the Stone of Orthanc (a Palant\u00edr), which has shown him that Sauron's armies are moving more swiftly and from more directions than he previously had been aware.  The Paths of the Dead appear to be the swiftest way towards his goal, and he has also decided to recruit the cursed armies of the dead, to be found along the Paths! \n"}, {"text": "Just prior to entering the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn encounters the Lady \u00c9owyn at the fortress of Edoras.  In conversation with \u00c9owyn, Aragorn discovers her greatest fear; what is it?  \n", "correct": "A cage", "options": ["The death of Aragorn", "A sword", "Battle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cage.\n\n\t\u00c9owyn tells Aragorn that she does 'not fear neither pain nor death', but does fear 'a cage'.  In other words, she is ripe for battle!  Though \u00c9owyn is battle-hungry, she is not crazy...she tries to convince Aragorn that taking the Paths of the Dead is suicide, but the heir of Isildur is set upon making the journey through the land of the dead.  He takes leave of Lady \u00c9owyn, never having fulfilled her desire for his love.  The paths await.
