Eight railway cars fell into the Birs River and over 70 people were killed. The bridge had been designed and erected in 1875 by Gustave Eiffel who went on to design the Eiffel Tower in Paris. One passenger car hung from the bridge and five remained on the bridge.At no time did the train derail, instead it plunged through the center of the bridge when it suffered structural collapse. This bridge disaster which injured over 170 people ushered in a new age of bridge safety in Switzerland which focused on design and upkeep. \n"}, {"text": "What caused the 2002 collapse of the I-40 Bridge in Webbers Falls, Oklahoma? ", "correct": "A barge ran into the bridge", "options": ["A terrorist bomb", "A tornado hit the bridge", "The river flooded over"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA barge ran into the bridge.\n\n\tThe I-40 (Interstate 40) bridge collapsed after a barge ran into it a took out almost 600 ft.

Images of the collapse were shown on news programs around the world in the aftermath of the disaster. This double-decker viaduct collapsed crushing the drivers on the lower level. Poor design contributed to this disaster as well as the 6.9 earthquake. The remains of the viaduct were completely torn down and a new road was built with modern safety measures and an earthquake resistant design. \n"}, {"text": "The 2002 Rafiganj bridge disaster in northern India, killed at least 130 people and was believed to be caused by which of the following?", "correct": "Sabotage", "options": ["Flooding", "Lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire", "Volcanic eruption"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSabotage.\n\n\tIt was reported that \"fish plates\", which anchor the rails to the bridge, were deliberately removed in an act of sabotage and revenge by the Naxalites, who were involved in guerrilla warfare in the area.

In the aftermath of this bridge collapse, legislation was passed that ensured proper  and regular inspection of all old bridges. \n"}, {"text": "The Tay Bridge disaster occurred over the Firth of Tay in which of the following countries?", "correct": "Scotland", "options": ["France", "The Netherlands", "Denmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotland.\n\n\tOn December 28th, 1879 during a heavy storm, the center of the two mile long Tay Bridge collapsed taking a passenger train with it.
