{"id": "222034", "name": "Biographies in the Movies I Online Quiz | Biographical Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Biographical Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "(1982) A story about the life and work of India's greatest 20th century figure, a man who began his campaign to seek greater rights for his people in South Africa, and eventually came to lead a nationwide movement in India against British rule.  \n\nName the film (and be careful with the spelling!)", "correct": "Gandhi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGandhi.\n\n\tMohandas K. Gandhi is masterfully played by Ben Kingsley, a British actor of half-Gujarat descent.  The film, directed by Richard Attenborough, is able to pick up the subtle details of Gandhi's life that explain his ascent into the leadership of the political movement to end British rule in India. \n"}, {"text": "Which biopic, released to theaters in 1967, features characters with the last names Parker and Barrow, respectively?", "correct": "Bonnie and Clyde", "options": ["Harold and Maude", "Melvin and Howard", "Ruben and Ed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonnie and Clyde.\n\n\t'Bonnie and Clyde' is the romanticized story of the rapid rise and fall of America's most notorious pair of gangsters, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.  In the film, Bonnie is played by the youthful Faye Dunaway, while Clyde is portrayed by the equally fresh-faced Warren Beatty. \n"}, {"text": "Which actor won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of U.S. World War II General George S. Patton, Jr. in the 1970 film 'Patton'?", "correct": "George C. Scott", "options": ["Marlon Brando", "Henry Fonda", "Kirk Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge C. Scott\n\n\tNo doubt George C. Scott was deserving of his Oscar, which made it all the more frustrating that he refused to accept the glittering little trophy.  Scott suggested that he was no more deserving of the award than any of the other men who were nominated, and denied accepting the Oscar in a kind of protest.  In some ways, this makes him almost as eccentric as the character he played in the film! \n"}, {"text": "Which completely bizarre American icon cum recluse was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2004 Martin Scorsese-directed biopic entitled 'The Aviator'?", "correct": "Howard Hughes", "options": ["Henry Ford", "J. D. Salinger", "Thomas Edison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoward Hughes.\n\n\tHoward Hughes has appeared as a character in several films, for example the 1980 film 'Melvin and Howard' (played by Jason Robards) and the 1988 film 'Tucker' (played by Dean Stockwell).  My view is that 'The Aviator' is the best portrayal of Hughes thus far, thanks to Scorsese's excellent direction and the surprisingly credible performance by DiCaprio. \n"}, {"text": "Which biopic is a film about the final days of Sir Thomas More, a man who stood for his principles, in conflict with Britain's King Henry VIII, and paid for it with his life?", "correct": "A Man for All Seasons", "options": ["The Lion in Winter", "The Private Life of King Henry VIII", "Cavalcade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Man for All Seasons.\n\n\tFred Zinnemann directs and Paul Scofield stars as More in this film that is based on a play by Robert Bolt.  Robert Shaw also appears in the film as Henry VIII, while Orson Welles does a lovely job portraying Cardinal Wolsey. \n"}, {"text": "Though the 1984 film 'Amadeus' is perhaps even more the story of Antonio Salieri than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the latter does figure prominently in the film.  Who portrays 'Wolfie' in this wonderful movie?", "correct": "Tom Hulce", "options": ["Roy Dotrice", "Jeffrey Jones", "Simon Callow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Hulce.\n\n\tF. Murray Abraham won the Best Actor Oscar for his stunning portrayal of Salieri, a composer who is so obsessed by his relative mediocrity as compared to the great Mozart that he deviously plans the latter's death.  Hulce is charming as Mozart, a man who is depicted as feckless and puerile in this Milos Forman-directed film. \n"}, {"text": "Tim Burton delighted movie audiences with his 1994 film about the wacky American filmmaker Ed Wood, entitled, oddly enough, 'Ed Wood'.  Who applied his top-notch acting talents to the title role in this film?", "correct": "Johnny Depp", "options": ["Tom Cruise", "Brad Pitt", "C. Thomas Howell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Depp.\n\n\tJohnny Depp did a marvelous job portraying the delightfully quirky Ed Wood, but Martin Landau really stole the show with is portrayal of the washed-up horror film actor Bela Lugosi.  If you haven't seen this film yet, rent it posthaste! \n"}, {"text": "Which 1960 film is the story about a slave living during ancient Roman times who engineers a massive slave revolt that shakes the very foundations of Rome?", "correct": "Spartacus", "options": ["I, Claudius", "The Robe", "Ben Hur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpartacus.\n\n\t'Spartacus' is impeccably directed by Stanley Kubrick, and features the acting of Kirk Douglas in the lead role.  Other notable performances in the film are given by Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons. \n"}, {"text": "One of the great biopics of all time was 'The Miracle Worker', the story of Helen Keller and her teacher Annie Sullivan.  Anne Bancroft won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Sullivan.  Which actress won the Supporting Oscar for her brilliant performance as Helen Keller?", "correct": "Patty Duke", "options": ["Elizabeth Taylor", "Goldie Hawn", "Sally Field"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatty Duke.\n\n\t'The Miracle Worker', directed by Arthur Penn, was one of those rare movies to sweep the actress categories at the Oscars.  Those were the only two Academy Awards won by the film. \n"}, {"text": "Jamie Foxx won his Academy Award for playing which American music legend in a 2004 rags-to-riches biopic?", "correct": "Ray Charles", "options": ["Stevie Wonder", "Chuck Berry", "James Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay Charles.\n\n\tThe movie 'Ray' features a grand performance by Jamie Foxx, previously most well-known for his comedy roles.  Directed by Taylor Hackford, the film 'Ray' does a good job of covering many of the most important moments in the incredibly inspiring life of Ray Charles.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it. \n"}]}
