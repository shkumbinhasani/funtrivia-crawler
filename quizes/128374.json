{"id": "128374", "name": "\"Richard II\" - How well do you know the action? Online Quiz | Literature | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Shakespeare", "Richard II"], "questions": [{"text": "In the opening scene, which man is bringing accusations against Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk?", "correct": "Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford", "options": ["Edmund of Langley, Duke of York", "John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster", "Lord Berkeley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford.\n\n\tIt is Henry Bolingbroke (some editions it is spelled \"Bullingbrook\") who initiates the opening action in the play. However, when the accusations begin you realise that there are a series of disputes, some involving Richard himself, that stretch back into the past. \n"}, {"text": "What does Bolingbroke accuse Mowbray of being guilty of?", "correct": "all of these charges", "options": ["plotting the Duke of Gloucester's death", "taking and spending money meant for paying soldiers", "being behind all the plots in England for 18 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nall of these charges.\n\n\tThe plotting of the Duke of Gloucester's death is probably the most serious accusation - Gloucester was the King's uncle. The misusing of the money is a very specific charge, but how can he possibly know that Mowbray was behind every single plot in England for 18 years? \n"}, {"text": "Where and when does King Richard decide to arrange the trial by combat that is to settle the dispute between the two men? ", "correct": "at Coventry upon St. Lambert's day", "options": ["at Winchester upon St. George's day", "at York upon St. John's day", "at Bristol upon St. David's day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nat Coventry upon St. Lambert's day\n\n\tSettling a dispute by trial by single combat is an idea that no longer finds much favour. \"Might is right\" is not a concept that appeals to many people. Quite often, however, you will see this presented as normal in films that purport to represent medieval life. There are several real recorded cases. \n"}, {"text": "To what does the Duchess of Gloucester compare the seven sons of King Edward III?", "correct": "branches of one tree and vials (containers) of sacred blood", "options": ["vials (containers) of sacred blood and blooming roses", " a river with many tributaries and branches of one tree", "the petals of a rose and the branches of  one  tree"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbranches of one tree and vials (containers) of sacred blood.\n\n\tBoth the blood image and the branches image are very important. For the Duchess, with the murder of her husband, the blood has been spilled and one of the branches hacked off. Gradually, each of the sons of Edward III is to disappear from the scene. After the death of Gloucester, only Gaunt (Lancaster) and Edmund Langley (York) remain. \n"}, {"text": "For how long is Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk, banished from the country?", "correct": "the rest of his life", "options": ["ten years", "five years", "twelve years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe rest of his life.\n\n\tRichard tells Mowbray never to return. However, he only banishes Bolingbroke for 10 years and then reduces the sentence to six years. Scholars have argued endlessly about his reasons for the different sentences. Remember that this is history as well as being Shakespeare's play. \n"}, {"text": "What reason does Richard offer for cutting Bolingbroke's sentence by four years?", "correct": "He has seen how upset Gaunt (Bolingbroke's father) has become", "options": ["He believed that Mowbray was more guilty", "He was frightened of Bolingbroke's power in England", "He wanted to please the Queen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has seen how upset Gaunt (Bolingbroke's father) has become.\n\n\tIt is an apparent sign of sympathy with his old uncle. Not every student of the play has accepted this as his real reason for the difference in sentences but this is what he says:\r  \"thy sad aspect\r  Hath from the number of his banish'd years...Pluck'd four away.\" \n"}, {"text": "Name the four close friends of the King who discuss Bolingbroke and Gaunt with him when they are alone in private.", "correct": "Bushy, Bagot, Green, Aumerle", "options": ["Bushy, Green, Berkeley, Bagot", "Surrey, Fitzwater, Green, Northumberland", "Bagot, York, Bushy, Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBushy, Bagot, Green, Aumerle.\n\n\tAumerle is the King's cousin and therefore the most important of these men. The others are little more than servants. It is interesting to trace the fate of the four men as the play unfolds. There is a big contrast between this private scene and the big public display at Coventry for the interrupted trial by combat. \n"}, {"text": "What does Richard wish for when he learns that John of Gaunt is dying?", "correct": "He hopes God will hint to the physicians that they should speed his end", "options": ["He hopes that he can get to see him once more", "He hopes John of Gaunt will soon recover", "He hopes that Bolingbroke can see his father again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe hopes God will hint to the physicians that they should speed his end.\n\n\tRichard says that he wants his uncle to die quickly, not to spare him any pain but so that he can use his money to finance his wars in Ireland. Gaunt's death would be very convenient for him. He sets off to see him hoping that he will arrive too late. \n"}, {"text": "Which person protests in public when Richard seizes all the lands, money, and possessions that had belonged to John of Gaunt?", "correct": "York", "options": ["Aumerle", "The Queen", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYork.\n\n\tThe Duke of York is the one that tells Richard to his face that what he is doing is both wrong and dangerous. He points out that he is breaking the natural chain of inheritance from father to son, thus risking his own throne for that which he inherited via his father from his grandfather, Edward III. Yorks sees it as both wicked and foolish. \n"}, {"text": "Which man is put in charge of the country whilst Richard goes to Ireland?", "correct": "York", "options": ["Northumberland", "Earl of Wiltshire", "Aumerle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYork.\n\n\tYork regards himself as too old to be the Regent. The Earl of Wiltshire is in charge of Richard's controversial means of raising taxes. Northumberland is soon to become a rebel. Choosing York often seems to be a strange decision, as he has just made a public protest about the decision to seize Bolingbroke's inheritance. \n"}, {"text": "Who is Henry Percy?", "correct": "Northumberland's son", "options": ["one of Richard's loyal servants", "Aumerle's brother", "the illegitimate son of the Duke of York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorthumberland's son.\n\n\tHenry Percy (nicknamed Hotspur) is Northumberland's son and a rebel against King Richard. Shakespeare develops his story more fully in \"Henry IV Part I\", where he becomes a rebel against Henry IV (Bolingbroke in \"Richard II\"). The more knowledgeable of Shakespeare's audience would recognise the fiery young man. \n"}, {"text": "Men from which part of the British Isles desert Richard's cause because they believe stories that he is already dead?", "correct": "Wales", "options": ["Ireland", "Scotland", "The North of England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWales.\n\n\tSalisbury learns this news of the Welshmen's desertion in a short scene with a Welsh captain. Both men link this event with various ominous signs of Richard's doom. Salisbury compares Richard to a shooting star that is now falling to earth. \n"}, {"text": "With which character from the Bible does Richard compare Bushy, Bagot, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire when he falsely believes they have betrayed him?", "correct": "Judas", "options": ["Christ", "Moses", "Samson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudas.\n\n\tHe calls them \"Judases\". It is himself that Richard sees as a Christ- like figure. This is an image that is repeated later on. Of the men mentioned, Bagot probably outlives Richard whilst the others have been killed. He has not been betrayed in the way he thinks. \n"}, {"text": "At which castle in Wales does Henry Bolingbroke and his army catch up with King Richard?", "correct": "Flint Castle", "options": ["Beaumaris Castle", "Harlech Castle", "Conway Castle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlint Castle.\n\n\tAn earlier scene takes place near Barkloughly Castle (Harlech), but it is at Flint Castle that Richard finally meets up with the man whom he had banished. \n"}, {"text": "At the beginning of Act 4, which man does Bagot accuse of being involved in the Duke of Gloucester's death?", "correct": "Aumerle", "options": ["Bushy", "John of Gaunt", "Edmund of Langley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAumerle.\n\n\tIt is very clear that there are lots of comparisons that can be made between the opening scene of the play and the opening scene of Act 4. Both Richard and then Bolingbroke (not yet king) have difficult groups of men to rule over. The old issue of who killed the Duke of Gloucester has come back again. \n"}, {"text": "What does Richard compare to a bucket?", "correct": "his crown", "options": ["his helmet", "a glass of wine", "his eyes full of tears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis crown.\n\n\tRichard talks of how he is down like a bucket at the bottom of a well because he is full of tears. There are constant signs of his poetic imagination in the comparisons he makes about himself and about Bolingbroke. \n"}, {"text": "What does Richard ask for from Bolingbroke which he sends a servant to bring?", "correct": "a looking-glass or mirror", "options": ["a copy of the accusations against him", "a glass of wine to help sustain him", "the royal sceptre"], "explanation": "\n\n\na looking-glass or mirror.\n\n\tAfter studying himself in the looking-glass he \"Dashes the glass against the ground\". He compares the brittleness of the glass with the brittleness of his former glory. It is often seen as a passionate, dramatic gesture, considered by many scholars to be typically self-pitying. \n"}, {"text": "Which man does Richard say will soon become a problem to Henry IV (Bolingbroke) because of his ambition?", "correct": "Northumberland", "options": ["Aumerle", "Ross", "York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorthumberland.\n\n\tRichard's predictions are accurate. In \"Henry IV Part 1\", Northumberland does indeed rebel against the man whom he helped to become king. Richard compares Northumberland to a ladder that Bolingbroke has used to climb to the throne. \n"}, {"text": "What is in the document that York snatches from his son Aumerle?", "correct": "the details of a plot to kill King Henry at Oxford", "options": ["the official proclamation that he is now called Rutland", "the real truth about who killed the Duke of Gloucester", "a plea to King Henry to spare King Richard's life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe details of a plot to kill King Henry at Oxford.\n\n\tHaving pledged his loyalty to the new king, Henry, York discovers treason in his own house. The Duchess knows that her son will be executed for this plot. Strangely, Shakespeare makes her suggest that Aumerle is their only son; it is one of his famous historical mistakes. \n"}, {"text": "What does King Henry (Bolingbroke) do when he learns of Aumerle's treason?", "correct": "He eventually agrees to spare Aumerle's life", "options": ["He banishes Aumerle to France", "He orders Aumerle's immediate execution", "He throws Aumerle into prison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe eventually agrees to spare Aumerle's life.\n\n\tAumerle is King Henry's cousin. (He is also Richard's cousin.) Having been pardoned, Aumerle becomes a faithful servant of Henry and Henry's son, Henry V. In fact, he is one of the few English noblemen killed at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. \n"}, {"text": "Of which person is Richard resentful for riding on his horse called Barbary?", "correct": "Bolingbroke (King Henry IV)", "options": ["Duke of York", "The Queen", "Aumerle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBolingbroke (King Henry IV).\n\n\tRichard resents both Bolingbroke and the horse. It is another symbol of how the power he had known has now passed to the new king. \n"}, {"text": "By what method did Richard suspect they would first try to murder him?", "correct": "by poison", "options": ["by smothering him in his sleep", "by starvation", "by torture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nby poison.\n\n\tRichard commands the Keeper to taste his food as he usually does. On this occasion the Keeper says that Exton has issued contrary orders. The actual details of Richard's death are uncertain, but Shakespeare portrays him as putting up a fight and killing two men before he falls. \n"}, {"text": "How does Henry (Bolingbroke) behave towards Carlisle when he is brought to his court on a charge of treason?", "correct": "He treats him with respect and lets him live, but retired from public life", "options": ["He forgives him and invites him to join his supporters", "He has him thrown into prison and later executed", "He banishes him from the country for the rest of his life"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe treats him with respect and lets him live, but retired from public life.\n\n\tHenry sees the Bishop of Carlisle as a man who has acted on principle even though he has opposed him all the time. It was Carlisle who made the dire predictions about what would happen to England if Henry overturned the God-appointed king, Richard. Carlisle's predictions are proved correct when the so-called \"War of the Roses\" breaks out. \n"}, {"text": "How does Henry IV propose to achieve forgiveness for the responsibility for Richard's death ?", "correct": "He will make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land", "options": ["He will abdicate in favour of his own son", "He will build a shrine in Canterbury Cathedral", "He will recall Richard's queen to England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe will make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\n\n\tIn fact, \"Henry IV Part 1\" opens with King Henry talking about his delayed trip to the Holy Land. There are too many troubles at home for him to lead such a pilgrimage. Ironically, the real Henry IV died in the \"Jerusalem\" chamber in London. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the only correct list of some of the people who are dead at the end of \"Richard II\"?", "correct": "Bushy , Duchess of Gloucester, Richard", "options": ["Henry Percy, Ross, Willoughby", "Gaunt, Aumerle, Green", "Earl of Wiltshire, Fitzwater, Richard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBushy , Duchess of Gloucester, Richard.\n\n\tRichard has died without either of his wives producing children. He has been succeeded by his cousin, who is descended via John of Gaunt in the Lancastrian line from Edward III. However, there are other claimants who can trace their descent back to Edward III, including one whose line was descended from an older brother of Gaunt. \n"}]}
