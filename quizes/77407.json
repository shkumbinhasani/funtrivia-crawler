{"id": "77407", "name": "Pinochle - Double Deck Quiz | Pinochle | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "  Card Games", "Pinochle"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following is not a difference between single and double-deck pinochle?", "correct": "In double -deck, the ten is the lowest ranking card, while in single-deck it is the second highest ranking card", "options": ["Single-deck pinochle has nines, while double-deck does not", "Double-deck pinochle has twice the number of aces, kings, queen, jacks and tens", "A double aces around is worth 1000 in single-deck, while it's only worth 100 in double-deck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn double -deck, the ten is the lowest ranking card, while in single-deck it is the second highest ranking card.\n\n\tThe tens are still the second highest ranking card in double-deck pinochle, just below the aces and above the kings. Also, in double-deck they do away with the nines and double the number of all other cards. Finally, the bidding system is quite different, with the value of double aces around being just one example. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Double-deck pinochle deals with a deck of 80 cards.", "correct": "True & T", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue & T.\n\n\tIndeed this is a rather cumbersome deck, but the fun of playing each hand makes the shuffling worth it! The double-deck is a combination of two regular pinochle decks sans the nines. Hence, there are four aces of spades, four tens of spades and so on. \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Customarily, a game of double-deck pinochle is won when one team reaches 5000 points.", "correct": "False & F", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse & F.\n\n\tActually, winning a typical game of double-deck pinochle only requires 500 points, although sometimes people set lower scores for shorter games. To reach 5000 would require a game of perhaps 10 hours? Only a hardcore fan would want that... \n"}, {"text": "True or false: It is possible to get a quadruple run in double-deck pinochle.", "correct": "True & T", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue & T.\n\n\tYes, it is possible, but I think it would take a miracle! (Or perhaps a clever cheater who knows how to set up a deck under the table?) \n"}, {"text": "Let us say that you have won the bid. You have a single run in hearts, have aces around (at least one ace in each suit) and double pinochle. How many points would this be worth as meld?", "correct": "55", "options": ["5500", "550", "155"], "explanation": "\n\n\n55.\n\n\tA single run would be worth 15 points, the aces 10 and the double pinochle 30, for a total of 55. Let's hope you didn't overbid! \n"}, {"text": "You have won the bid and you have two aces of trump but no other aces. During the showing of meld your partner displayed aces around, as did the opponent to your right. The opponent to your left did not show aces around. You would like to assure that the lead comes over to your partner, so you play a non-trump queen. Yes or no, was this the best way to reach your objective?", "correct": "No & N & False & F", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo & N & False & F.\n\n\tConsidering the fact that you have two trump aces but no other aces and that both your partner and the opponent to your right showed aces around, it is guaranteed that the player to your left has no trump aces. At the same time, it is highly possible that the opponent to your left has aces in the three non-trump suits.Hence, your best play, if your intention is to assure your partner the lead, is to lay down a trump queen or king. This ensures that your partner will pick up the lead and may result in your leftside opponent losing a counter in trump! Ah the subtleties of pinochle...don't you love them? \n"}, {"text": "Junlin, your opponent, wins the bid by default at 50 (she is the dealer and all other players have passed). She shows a total of 10 meld, while her partner Hernando shows a total of 8 meld. What happens next?", "correct": "The hand is defaulted", "options": ["Hernando turns over the table in frustration and goes home", "They are given an automatic meld score of 20", "They must attempt to play the hand out and reach the bid of 50, requiring 32 more points"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe hand is defaulted.\n\n\tUnfortunately, the hand must be defaulted and 50 points subtracted from Junlin and Hernando's score. Theoretically, it is possible that Hernando could turn the table over, but I have always felt Hernando to be a cool-headed player. \n"}, {"text": "Your opponent wins the bid and plays an ace of trump during the first trick. Which of the following should you play, assuming you have all of the following cards?", "correct": "Jack of trump", "options": ["King of trump", "Ten of trump", "Ace of trump"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack of trump.\n\n\tUnless you are trying to lose, the jack would be the wisest play. If you play the ace, ten or king, you are providing a point to your opponent for no reason. Perhaps you want to lose intentionally though, something I did not factor into the question...doh! \n"}, {"text": "Following the deal, you find that in your hand you have double aces around and several marriages, but no run or particularly strong suit. Your partner gives an initial bid of 60 and the opponent to your right bids 65, what should you do (assuming your partner is well-versed in the art of bidding)?", "correct": "Bid 75", "options": ["Have Hernando turn over the table in frustration", "Bid 70", "Pass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBid 75.\n\n\tYou should bid 75. After 60, bids jump in increments of 5, so a 10 jump bid is considered a meld bid. Hernando shouldn't be necessary here. \n"}, {"text": "Customarily, what does an initial bid of 51 represent?", "correct": "Aces around", "options": ["A double run", "Any 10 meld", "Bluff bid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAces around.\n\n\tYou should only bid 51 if you have aces around, unless you have agreed with your partner otherwise! \n"}]}
