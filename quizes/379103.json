It doesn't work as planned.  Receiving new customers, the duo recognizes that they're likely to be advisers from TripAdventurers.com and Iris brings them up to a refurbished, lavishly-outfitted suite. When she leaves, however, Sally appears before the couple, lamenting the lingering pain of those in the hotel and stabbing one of the customers in the chest with a syringe, causing him to overdose immediately.  The other customer runs into the hall where she comes upon Will Drake who, admitting he's new to the murder game, stabs her in the neck. Liz and Iris decide they need to have a meeting. \n"}, {"text": "In what year would the Hotel Cortez become a historical landmark?", "correct": "2026", "options": ["2018", "2050", "2035"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2026.\n\n\tLiz and Iris are able to pull a number of the ghosts together to the bar for a meeting and it's clear that there's a fair bit of unrest.  Nonetheless, they make their case that they wish to make the Hotel Cortez something special and will do their best to accommodate the living and the dead.  As it turns out, Sally and Will are the only people who've been murdering in the hotel as of late, and even James March says that they need to make a practical change to keep afloat or, else, face their makers. March says that they should hold out until the year 2026, the hotel's centennial, to be designated a historical landmark...they just need to get there. Sally continues to refuse, even if March can make her do what he wants. \n"}, {"text": "What gift does Iris purchase for Sally?", "correct": "iPhone", "options": ["FitBit", "CD player", "Jacket"], "explanation": "\n\n\niPhone.\n\n\tIris brings Sally a bottle of champagne and speaks to her frankly, apologizing for killing her years before.  Iris knows she hasn't been the same since John left and Sally says that she'll never be alone if she can pull people under with her to make her feel any ounce of pain she does.  As a gift, Iris gives Sally a phone (and new, complimentary wi-fi) and encourages her to get out of 1994.  Soon, Sally becomes internet-famous...and lets go of her past habits, tossing her heroin out the window.  Being lost to the world no longer has its appeal. \n"}, {"text": "Liz takes over the Will Drake brand with Will's approval.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tLiz speaks to Will Drake about the past year and the former owner laments feeling like he doesn't exist.  Liz assures him that, as long as his son is alive, his legacy will live on, even if his fashion line fades away after his death.  In fact, to give Drake a sense of purpose in his afterlife, Liz hands over a sketchbook and tells him to do what he loves most. With Drake rumoured to be in rehab or hidden away somewhere, he can continue to make fashion, but with Liz at the face of the brand.  Soon, Liz has total authority over the Will Drake brand, and fashion shows are once more held in the Hotel Cortez lobby, but Liz remains unfulfilled. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the psychic who is brought in to the Hotel Cortez?", "correct": "Billie Dean", "options": ["Lana", "Constance", "Adelaide"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBillie Dean.\n\n\tIris gets Liz a gift in the form of Billie Dean Howard, a notable psychic who may be able to shine light on Tristan's whereabouts.

Billie Dean is, however, able to communicate with Donovan who, while not in the Hotel Cortez, is able to get through to the conduit to communicate with his mother, tell her everything is alright, and let her know that he loves her. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Liz Taylor?", "correct": "The Countess", "options": ["None of these; it was suicide", "Iris", "Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Countess.\n\n\tWhile Liz gives up on finding love, she does find that she is a grandparent.  After making peace with Douglas, Liz met his daughter-in-law and, soon, his grandchild.  But things need to end soon.  Liz confides in Ramona that the doctors have given a diagnosis-- she has prostate cancer and it's spread to the spine. Soon, Liz has to tell the other ghosts, and she does, and with weapons in hand she asks them to end her life in the hotel so that she can be with them forever.  Instead of being killed, she shall be reborn.  As the other ghosts move in for the kill, The Countess appears at the door, enters the room, and lovingly helps her make the transition. \n"}, {"text": "A series of TV specials brings the Hotel Cortez into the limelight.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs soon as Liz is killed, she looks over her body in the hotel room bed and smokes a cigarette.  Tristan enters the room behind her and the two discuss what's happened.  Liz, worried that Tristan hated her for everything, couldn't have been more wrong; Tristan just wanted her to live.  Now, the two of them can stay together forever.\r The year 2022 rolls around and Devil's Night falls upon the Hotel Cortez.  With Billie Dean's TV specials having aired, the location is a bit of a hotbed for activity.  They were right that the TV specials would be publicity, but not what they expected.  Iris and Ramona suggest, maybe they should shut down, but John Lowe comes in to suggest they not do that. \n"}, {"text": "Whose idea was it for the Lowes to return to the Hotel Cortez?", "correct": "Scarlett's", "options": ["Holden's", "John's", "Alex's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScarlett's.\n\n\tFor years, as it would seem, Billie Dean has attempted to contact John Lowe, known to be the Ten Commandments Killer, in Room 64, but she has been unsuccessful.  On Devil's Night, in 2022, she's invited back to the hotel on what she doesn't know is his invitation.  He appears to her and poses for an interview, during which she asks about his family and it's clear that not all went swimmingly after their escape from the Hotel Cortez. Since he would only kill people he felt deserved to die, finding sustenance for Alex and Holden wasn't too easy.  It was Scarlett who suggested that, instead of turning themselves in, they return to their home, the Hotel Cortez, since they were all reborn there...except Scarlett, who would be sent to school with Will Drake's son. \n"}, {"text": "John Lowe dies, but by which of the following means?", "correct": "Guns", "options": ["Natural causes", "Knives", "Poison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuns.\n\n\tJohn found more success in Los Angeles, especially with the family not on the run anymore, but one day the police finally tracked him down to the streets outside the Hotel Cortez and, on a run to get blood for his family, he was shot and killed by a group of cops before he could make it back into the building.\rBillie Dean asks John why she only feels his presence on October 30th and he tells her it's Devil's Night, and if she leaves her camera crews behind, he'll show her what she wants to know.  He takes her up to March's dinner party to meet the other killers.  She's given a glass of absinthe and told to enjoy the party. \n"}, {"text": "Does Scarlett survive?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt doesn't take long before Billie Dean is sat at the table with the spirits of the dead, James March's own murderers' row.  Her protective white light, as it seems, has been snuffed out.  Unfortunately, Billie Dean is the guest of honour; they handcuff her to the chair.  Ramona enters the room, the only living guest, other than Billie Dean, and gives an ultimatum.  She can leave the Hotel Cortez and never speak a word of it again, or she can be the fresh meat for the Devil's Night Feast.  Billie Dean flees unharmed while John watches on.\rAfter dinner, John returns to Room 64 to find Alex and Holden asleep.  Scarlett is there to meet him too.  Now older, she understands her role and takes a seat next to her family.  John goes to sleep and vanishes for another year.\rThe clock flips to 2:25 as The countess enjoys a drink and a cigarette at the Hotel Cortez bar.  A man who's just her type checks in for Halloween, and he has a jawline for days. \n"}]}
