{"id": "261734", "name": "Scooby Dooby Doo! Quiz | Scooby-Doo | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Scooby-Doo"], "questions": [{"text": "What was the full title of the very first Scooby-Doo cartoon series, which graced television screens across America beginning in September of 1969?", "correct": "Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!", "options": ["Scooby-Doo and His Crew!", "Scooby-Doo, Use the Loo!", "Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Too!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You!.\n\n\tApparently, the makers of this first series had several potential titles in mind, including the very basic 'Mysteries Five' and the amazingly catchy 'Who's S-S-Scared?'.  The show ran for two seasons (and 25 episodes), from 1969 to 1971.  Unlike a good wine, it was cancelled long before its time. \n"}, {"text": "Don Messick was the amazing, stuttering voice behind the magical mutt that is Scooby-Doo.  What popular American icon with a steady, almost lilting voice, played the voice role of Scooby's oddball human pal Shaggy?", "correct": "Casey Kasem", "options": ["Jack Webb", "Charlton Heston", "Paul Harvey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasey Kasem.\n\n\tCasey Kasem, who entertained American music lovers for years with his weekly syndicated radio countdown programs, also has contributed greatly with his voice-over performances.  Along with his insightful portrayals of Scooby's skinny pal Shaggy (who always seems to have the munchies, wonder why?), Kasem has also lent his quavering vocal talents to such animated characters as Robin in the various 'Batman' and 'Superfriends' cartoons and to Alexander Cabot III from 'Josey and the Pussycats', amongst others. \n"}, {"text": "If there's one thing Scooby loves more than life itself, that's a delicious and hardy Scooby Snack.  Is Scooby the only member of his little team of clever sleuths who enjoys these delightsome morsels?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tLest we forget, Shaggy also regularly indulges in those tasty culinary tidbits, satisfying his neverending desire for anything edible.  But Scooby and Shaggy are not the only ones who find Scooby Snacks to be irresistable, they are now marketed in the form of vanilla-flavored wafers, consumable for individuals such as you and me!  There is also an official brand of dog treats that are labeled 'Scooby Snacks'.  Be sure to keep them locked up when Shaggy visits! \n"}, {"text": "Among the gang of teens that form Scooby-Doo's entourage, there are two young men and two young women.  One of the young men, obviously, is Shaggy.  The other is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed hunk who today would command at least a two million dollar salary per episode.  What is the name of this veritable mountain of muscle with brains to boot?", "correct": "Fred", "options": ["Biff", "Steve", "Brad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFred.\n\n\tFrederick Herman Jones, usually shortened to 'Fred' or 'Freddie', is the de facto leader of Scooby-Doo's small cohort.  And who could resist the charms of Mr. Fred Jones?  The guy has it all, a powerful mind, the face of Adonis, a statuesque body, killer wheels and two hot women at his side (yes, Velma is also hot!) \n"}, {"text": "Daphne and Velma are the two female members of Scooby-Doo's clever clique.  Which of these two young ladies, if either, would often utilize the catchphrase 'Zoinks!' when feeling surprised?", "correct": "Neither of them", "options": ["Daphne", "Velma", "Both of them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeither of them.\n\n\tActually, 'Zoinks!' is the catchphrase of Shaggy.  I have no idea of the etymology of the expression.  Daphne (last name: Blake) would utter the word 'Jeepers!' in certain situations, while Velma Dinkley would fire off an occasional 'Jinkies!' as a way of expressing astonishment or consternation. \n"}, {"text": "Scooby-Doo's gang, officially called 'Mystery, Inc.' for tax purposes, drove around in a specially equipped 1968 Chevy Sportvan 108 lovingly nicknamed the 'Mystery Machine'.  Along with its lovely blue and green paint job, and the words 'Mystery Machine', what items are found painted on the sides of this powerful vehicle?", "correct": "Flowers", "options": ["Moons", "Clovers", "Diamonds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlowers.\n\n\tThe Mystery Machine was fully equipped with flamethrowers, mounted laser-sited machine guns, stealth mode, oil slick capability, voice-activated auto-drive, turbo jet propulsion and a fully automated computerized tracking system linked to a satellite network.  Okay, not really.  Actually, it just had a few seats, some seat belts and some lovely armrests.  It was a very reliable vehicle. \n"}, {"text": "Following the original series, Scooby-Doo and his friends were reincarnated for a second set of television cartoons, namely 'The New Scooby-Doo Movies'.  Which of these individuals or groups were not guest stars in at least one episode of these 'movies'?", "correct": "Richard Nixon and his cabinet", "options": ["The Three Stooges", "Phyllis Diller", "The Harlem Globetrotters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Nixon and his cabinet.\n\n\tOkay, so the Stooges, the Globetrotters and Phyllis Diller are funny.  Acknowledged.  But imagine the humor if Scooby Doo and the gang encountered Tricky Dick and his political pals?  Do you think Scooby-Doo would have been entered into the 'Enemies List'?  Perhaps the gang could have been depicted solving the Watergate break-in?  It's not really G. Gordon Liddy, it's old man Withers! \n"}, {"text": "In 1979, the makers of Scooby-Doo had the incredibly brilliant idea of introducing Scooby-Doo's nephew to the world, an overly confident little ball of energy with which of the following monikers?", "correct": "Scrappy", "options": ["Stumpy", "Skippy", "Slappy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScrappy.\n\n\tSome suggest that the introduction of Scrappy-Doo was the official 'Jumping the Shark' moment for the Scooby-Doo franchise, and I can't entirely disagree with such sentiments.  However, Scrappy is by far a better creation than that obnoxious little red-headed character that they introduced on 'Diff'rent Strokes', and in fact, is perhaps even a bit more palatable than Cousin Oliver from the final years of Brady Bunch. \n"}, {"text": "I'll bet you didn't know that Scooby-Doo is quite the athlete.  Well, at least that was how he was portrayed on the program entitled 'Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics' that ran from 1977 to 1979.  What was the name of the team craftily led by our favorite Great Dane on 'Laff-a-Lympics'?", "correct": "The Scooby Doobies", "options": ["The Scooby Doowops", "The Scooby Yahooeys", "The Scooby Scrappers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Scooby Doobies.\n\n\tAmong the characters on the Scooby Doobie team were: Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Scooby-Dum, Dynomutt, The Blue Falcon, Captain Caveman and his Teen Angels, Speed Buggy, Tinker, Babu and Hong Kong Phooey.  Apparently Fred, the primadonna, would not compete due to a knee injury suffered while playing high school football. \n"}, {"text": "Unfortunately for fans of Scooby-Doo, no new Scooby-Doo television series have been produced since 'A Pup Named Scooby-Doo' ran from 1988 to 1991.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, there have been several new series since the demise of Scooby-Doo's puppy self.  'What's New, Scooby-Doo?' ran from 2002 to 2005.  'Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!' began its run in 2006.  There have also been several unfortunate live-action film versions made, the first in 2002 and a sequel in 2004.  Unfortunate, I say, because they stunk!\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
