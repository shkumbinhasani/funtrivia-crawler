{"id": "143461", "name": "Hardest 'Harold and Maude' (Part 2) Trivia Quiz | Harold and Maude . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "   Movies H-K", "Harold and Maude"], "questions": [{"text": "When we last left off, Harold was seeing his psychiatrist again.  Following this, we see him once again discussing with his mother the future of Harold's existence.  What life-changing decision has Harold's mother made for him, suggesting that he will no longer live 'a child's life'?", "correct": "He will be married", "options": ["He will be sent to college in England", "He will enter the military", "He will become an executive in the family company"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe will be married.\n\n\tAnd of course the choice of partner will be made not by Harold, but by his mother.  'We have our duties, our obligations, our principles!  In short, I think it is time Harold for you to get married.'  Is it any wonder Harold is looking for another path? \n"}, {"text": "The scene shifts to church, where Harold attends a very poorly attended funeral, his second of the film.  Harold sees and talks with Maude at this funeral.  Is this the first time they actually meet?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, during the first funeral of the film, they are both in attendance, but alas don't meet.  They only make eye contact.  During the funeral in the church, Maude offers Harold refreshments (licorice) and complains about everyone wearing black! \n"}, {"text": "Following the funeral, the two protagonists formally introduce themselves.  What is Maude's full name?", "correct": "Marjorie Chardin", "options": ["Madge Schultz", "Madeline Rimbaud", "Margarite Gugliemo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarjorie Chardin.\n\n\tChardin...hmm, I believe that would make her French.  We'll never know.  She actually introduces herself as 'Dame Marjorie Chardin', but requests that Harold call her 'Maude'.  Maude is portrayed by actress Ruth Gordon, whose career, if an uncredited role in the 1915 film 'The Whirl of Life' is counted, spanned 73 years (her last role was in the film 'Voyage of the Rock Aliens', released in 1988).  She lived from 1896 until 1985, and spent much of her career writing stage and screen plays. \n"}, {"text": "One of Maude's little quirks is her penchant for stealing cars.  What type of vehicle does Maude steal after walking out from the funeral at the church?", "correct": "Volkswagon Bug", "options": ["Police motorcycle", "Hearse", "Trans Am"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVolkswagon Bug.\n\n\tAfter chatting with Harold a bit, Maude wildly drives off in a light blue Volkswagon Bug.  We soon discover that this is not her car, but rather the priest's car!  Certainly it is a sin to steal a priest's car? \n"}, {"text": "Back at the house, we find that Harold's mother has entered Harold into a computer dating service.  Accompanying the entrance forms is a personality interview, in the form of a questionnaire, that Harold's mother reads and responds to with much comic effect.  Which of these is NOT a question included in the questionnaire?", "correct": "Do you agree that your mother played an important role in your life?", "options": ["Do you believe in capital punishment for murder?", "Should women run for president of the United States?", "Do you often get the feeling that perhaps life is not worth living?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo you agree that your mother played an important role in your life?.\n\n\tWhile Harold's mother reads the questions, Harold prepares another mock suicide, this time using a prop gun.  The way in which she presents the questions is quite hilarious.  Though the responses are supposed to be Harold's, she answers all of the questions without his aide, mostly responding as if the questions were directed at her. \n"}, {"text": "Which question from the survey does Harold's mother find 'distasteful'?", "correct": "Do you find the idea of wife swapping distasteful?", "options": ["Do you find the idea of sex before marriage distasteful?", "Do you find the idea of free love distasteful?", "Do you find the idea of multiple marriage partners distasteful?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo you find the idea of wife swapping distasteful?.\n\n\tFollowing the wife swapping question, Harold 'shoots himself', prompting his mother to say, irritatedly, 'Harold, please!'  She then continues on with the questions. \n"}, {"text": "Following the third funeral attended by both Harold and Maude, they take a ride together over to Maude's humble abode.  In what sort of contraption does Maude live?", "correct": "Train car", "options": ["Mobile home", "Workshed", "Warehouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrain car.\n\n\tHarold has no choice but to come home with Maude after the gloomy third funeral, held on a rainy day.  You see, Maude has stolen Harold's hearse!  (Harold's response to Maude's question, 'Your hearse?' 'Yearse!')  Only an eccentric like Maude could live in a train car, I do believe. \n"}, {"text": "While in Maude's home, Harold learns about some of Maude's former, interesting hobbies.  One former occupation of Harold's elderly friend was to break into pet shops in order to liberate which creatures?", "correct": "Canaries", "options": ["Goldfish", "Tabby cats", "Rats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanaries.\n\n\t'Ah, my.  How the world still dearly loves a cage,' says Maude.  She complains of zoos and prisons 'overflowing'.  Is there a theme here?  (By the way, Maude eventually decided that freeing canaries from pet shops was 'an idea way before its time'.) \n"}, {"text": "Harold leaves Maude's place abruptly in order to make his next appointment with the psychiatrist.  Afterward, he returns home where his first arranged date awaits, Candy Gulf.  How does Harold manage to be rid of Ms. Gulf?", "correct": "He pretends to immolate himself", "options": ["He feigns choking to death", "He pretends to fall out of a top-story window", "He feigns being electrocuted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe pretends to immolate himself.\n\n\tWhile Candy and Harold's mother discuss the former's fascinating course of study at school, which includes a major in poli sci and a minor in home economics, Harold walks out to the backyard dressed in a white robe.  He proceeds to pour gasoline all over himself and appears to set himself alight.  Aghast, Candy screams and runs out just as Harold returns to introduce himself. \n"}, {"text": "Harold seeks out Maude once again after the Candy Gulf debacle, and finds her posing nude for an ice-sculptor in a cavernous warehouse.  What is the artist's name for whom Maude poses?", "correct": "Glaucus", "options": ["Nerthus", "Balthus", "Paulus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlaucus.\n\n\tGlaucus is played by South African native Cyril Cusack (no relation to John or Joan), whose acting career stretched even longer than Ruth Gordon's (1918-1992)!  You may recognize him in films such as 'My Left Foot' and 'Far and Away'.  Amusingly, we see that Maude lives it up in every way, even posing nude for artists at the age of 80!  Please stay tuned for the next installment, coming soon.  Thanks for playing! \n"}]}
