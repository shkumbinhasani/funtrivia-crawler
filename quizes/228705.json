Who directed this relatively unappreciated horror/thriller classic?", "correct": "Robert Aldrich", "options": ["Samuel Fuller", "Martin Ritt", "Sidney Lumet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Aldrich.\n\n\tThe list of films Robert Aldrich directed is quite distinguished.  They include 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?', 'The Dirty Dozen' and 'The Longest Yard'.  This was his second film with Bette Davis, a quasi-sequel to 'Baby Jane'. \n"}, {"text": "Which among these all-time great Hollywood actresses takes on the title role of Charlotte Hollis in this film?", "correct": "Bette Davis", "options": ["Barbara Stanwyck", "Joan Crawford", "Katherine Hepburn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette Davis.\n\n\tBette Davis really pours it on in this film, displaying her full range of acting talents. This film was made the year following her last Academy Award nomination (for 'Baby Jane').\r In 'Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte', Bette plays Charlotte, a lonely, single woman approaching her elderly years who has spent much of her life in seclusion.  She only emerges from this seclusion when her property is threatened. \n"}, {"text": "Olivia de Havilland appears in this film as the scheming cousin of Charlotte.  What is the given name of the de Havilland character?", "correct": "Miriam", "options": ["Janice", "Sarah", "Phyllis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiriam.\n\n\tOriginally, this part was to go to Joan Crawford, but conflict on the set forced the producers to replace her with de Havilland.\r Olivia de Havilland is Charlotte's cousin Mirian Deering.

Who is this actress who portrayed the maid on the Hollis estate?", "correct": "Agnes Moorehead", "options": ["Dorothy Malone", "Anne Baxter", "Rita Moreno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgnes Moorehead.\n\n\tAgnes Moorehead, who many of us know as the eccentric mother of Samantha on the television show 'Bewitched', is stunning in the role of Velma Cruther, the almost sinister maid who has been at Charlotte's side for so many years.  Unfortunately, Moorehead did not win the Oscar that year.

His body is then inserted into a swamp.  In one of the most memorable and ominous scenes in the film, he returns from the dead, body complete with mud and swamp vegetation.
