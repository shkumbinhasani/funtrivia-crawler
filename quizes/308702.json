{"id": "308702", "name": "Hard The Horcruxes and Other Parts of Voldemort's Soul Quiz / Test  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Harry Potter"], "questions": [{"text": "How many functional horcruxes were created by Voldemort?", "correct": "7", "options": ["5", "6", "8"], "explanation": "\n\n\n7.\n\n\tHe wanted to create six originally, so that his soul would be in seven pieces.  He believed that seven was a powerful, mystical number.\r He had created five horcruxes at the time that he attacked the Potters.  He was planning to use the murder of Harry to create his sixth.  \r But when the Avada Kedavra curse backfired, it killed his body.  But the act of *trying* to kill Harry tore his soul nonetheless, and that piece of his soul attached itself to Harry, making Harry functionally the sixth horcrux, although he was not made one by use of the spell in the dark magic library book.\r Voldemort used the murder of Bertha Jorkins in Albania to create a horcrux of his pet snake Nagini. \n"}, {"text": "Which was the first inanimate-object horcrux to appear in the \"Harry Potter\" heptalogy?", "correct": "Riddle Diary", "options": ["Diadem of Ravenclaw", "Cup of Hufflepuff", "Locket of Slytherin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiddle Diary.\n\n\tThe diary was surreptitiously put into Ginny Weasley's cauldron by Lucius Malfoy.  Ginny later found it and discovered that it had a consciousness that she could confide in.  This emotional attachment is what allowed the part of Voldemort's soul in it to possess Ginny and make her open the Chamber of Secrets.\r Dumbledore became suspicious of the diary's true nature, suspecting it was more than just a receptacle of memories.  This is what led him to the deduction that Voldemort had made horcruxes. \n"}, {"text": "How many of Hogwarts' founders had an item they owned made into a horcrux?", "correct": "3", "options": ["2", "1", "4"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tOnly an object of Godric Gryffindor was never made into a horcrux.  \r The only object known to have belonged to him was his goblin-made sword.  In the end, it turned out to be the one object that could destroy horcruxes, as Harry had inadvertently let it absorb basilisk venom.\r Hufflepuff's Cup, Ravenclaw's Diadem, and Slytherin's Locket were the three founders' objects that became horcruxes. \n"}, {"text": "In what scene in the \"Harry Potter\" books were four pieces of Voldemort's soul in the same place at the same time?", "correct": "Batilda Bagshot's home on Christmas Eve - HP7", "options": ["Underground lake - HP6", "In the Chamber of Secrets - HP2", "Hepzibah Smith's Home - HP6"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatilda Bagshot's home on Christmas Eve - HP7.\n\n\tAs Nagini was fighting Harry to keep him at Bagshot's home, she called her master.  Just as Voldemort arrived, he saw Harry and Hermione (disguised as Muggles) falling out the window and disapparating.\r The four parts of Voldemort's soul there were: 1) Voldemort himself, 2) Nagini (living horcrux), 3) Harry (unintentional horcrux), and 4) Slytherin's locket, around Harry's neck.\r In the underground lake scene (HP6), only the soul piece within Harry was there.  The horcrux that they hoped to find there had already been retrieved by Kreacher and Regulus.\r In the Chamber of Secrets (HP2), only Harry and the diary were present.\r In Hepzibah Smith's home (the pensieve memory of Hokey), there were Tom Riddle, Hufflepuff's Cup, and Slytherin's locket.  However, the founders' objects were not yet horcruxes, so Tom was the only \"piece\" there. \n"}, {"text": "Which Hogwarts house ghost was a relative of one of the founders, and had knowledge about a founders object which became a horcrux?", "correct": "The Grey Lady (Ravenclaw)", "options": ["The Bloody Baron (Slytherin)", "The Fat Friar (Hufflepuff)", "Sir Nicholas (Griffindor)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Grey Lady (Ravenclaw).\n\n\tThe Grey Lady was Helena Ravenclaw in life, the daughter of founder Rowena Ravenclaw.  \r She had run away with her mother's diadem, wanting to be more clever.  She went to Albania, where the Bloody Baron found her.  Spurning his romantic advances, he killed her, then himself.\r Centuries later, the charming Tom Riddle talked her into revealing where she had left the diadem.  He then found it, made it into a horcrux, then returned to Hogwarts on the pretense of asking for a job.  While there, he hid the diadem in the Room of Requirement (in the guise of the Room of Hidden Things). \n"}, {"text": "Which horcrux near-fatally attacked someone possessing it just before it was itself destroyed?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Diary (Ginny Weasley)", "Ring (Dumbledore)", "Locket (Harry)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tThe diary was absorbing Ginny's life force, in an attempt to become truly alive.\r The locket began choking Harry (who was wearing it) when he dove after Griffindor's sword in the pond in the Forest of Dean.\r The ring released a curse that Voldemort had put on it when Albus tried the ring on in an attempt to utilize it as the Resurrection Stone. \n"}, {"text": "On the last day of the main story, how many pieces of Voldemort's soul were destroyed within this 24-hour period at Hogwarts or in its surrounds?", "correct": "5", "options": ["4", "3", "2"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5.\n\n\tThe very last evening of the main story, five pieces were destroyed: Hufflepuff's Cup, Ravenclaw's Diadem, the piece within Harry, the piece within Nagini, and then Voldemort himself. \n"}, {"text": "Who first discovered that Harry did not die in the Forbidden Forest, after Voldemort sent a Killing Curse at him?", "correct": "Narcissa Malfoy", "options": ["Bellatrix Lastrange", "Rubeus Hagrid", "Hermione Granger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNarcissa Malfoy.\n\n\tVoldemort forced her to inspect his body, because something seemed to have gone wrong with the curse.  It had knocked him down too.\r As she knelt over Harry, she felt his chest directly and found out he was alive.  However, she quietly asked Harry if Draco was still alive, and he said, \"yes.\"  She then began the charade that Harry was indeed dead, in hopes of getting into Hogwarts and finding her son.\r The curse *did* destroy the piece of soul that had resided in Harry since he was a baby.  With its destruction, he no longer could speak Parseltongue, which he found out later.\r Hagrid carried Harry back to Hogwarts Castle, but he believed Harry to be dead. \n"}, {"text": "Of the following methods, which destroyed the fewest pieces of Voldemort's soul?", "correct": "Fiendfyre", "options": ["Griffindor's Sword", "Basilisk Fang", "Avada Kedavra curse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFiendfyre.\n\n\tCrabbe's ill-cast Fiendfyre curse destroyed everything that was in the Room of Hidden Things, including Ravenclaw's Diadem.  But it ended up only destroying that one horcrux.\r Basilisk fangs were used to destroy two horcruxes: the diary and Hufflepuff's Cup.\r Avada Kedavra curses killed the piece of soul in Harry, as well as rebounding and killing Voldemort himself later.\r Griffindor's Sword destroyed three horcruxes: Gaunt's ring (the Resurrection Stone), Slytherin's locket, and Nagini. \n"}, {"text": "Only Gryffindors could kill or destroy pieces of Voldemort's soul.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOf the eight pieces that Voldemort's soul was ultimately torn into, five were indeed destroyed by Gryffindors: the diary (Harry), the ring (Albus), the locket (Ron), the cup (Hermione), and the snake (Neville).\r But three pieces were destroyed by Slytherins: the diadem (Crabbe by Fiendfyre), the piece in Harry (Voldemort by Avada Kedavra), and Voldemort himself (by Voldemort, when his Avada Kedavra spell rebounded off of Harry's Expeliarmus spell.  [Also, the Elder Wand couldn't kill Harry, as he was its true master.]). \n"}]}
