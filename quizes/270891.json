He claims that it's like having a postponed execution.  The date was changed because the caterers had the date wrong.  George also tells Jerry that Susan's best friend, Hallie, just broke up with her boyfriend and now the wheels are in motion to set them up together. Meanwhile, Kramer talks about his date with a woman named Connie.  He tells Jerry to wake him up in twenty minutes because he read (in a book about Leonardo Da Vinci) that if he sleeps twenty minutes every three hours, he's refreshed and he technically lives longer. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the new employee in Elaine's office?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Tom", "Ray", "Mel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tAt Elaine's office, Mr. Peterman introduces a new employee, Bob, to the group and claims that there's a bit of a baptismal 'trial by fire' that he must complete.  Peterman assigns Bob all of the fact-checking duties for the new catalogue.  Unfortunately, Bob doesn't hear the request because his hearing aid's volume is too low, so Mr. Peterman gives the horrible job to Elaine instead. Meanwhile, Jerry is able to get himself into the Friar's Club with a reservation from a friend, so he; Susan's friend, Hallie; Susan; and George all go out to dinner.  Unfortunately, Jerry is unaware that he is supposed to wear a dinner jacket to the occasion, so accepts a temporary one from the maitre'd. \n"}, {"text": "What is the crazy idea that Kramer thinks of in this episode?", "correct": "A restaurant that only serves peanut butter and jelly", "options": ["A restaurant where you make your own pizza pie", "A restaurant that only serves pancakes", "A restaurant that only serves the top halves of muffins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA restaurant that only serves peanut butter and jelly.\n\n\tWhen Jerry returns home, he wakes Kramer up at 10:30, thus allowing him to last basically the entire night without much sleep.  Kramer is enjoying his new plan as it gives him much more time to do things.  In fact, he claims his brain is now functioning better.  His idea for a restaurant called 'P, B, & J's' is one such idea that he comes up with. Kramer says that his date with Connie went well too, although she never wants to leave the apartment.  He also notes that Jerry is still wearing his Friar's Club jacket, having forgotten to leave it a the club after dinner.

She also tells Jerry about Bob, who always seems to have a convenient problem with his earpiece whenever work needs to be done.  She proves this to him when Bob walks by the door.  When Jerry stops in at the restroom, he puts the idea to the test and tries to get Bob's attention.  When he returns to Elaine with the news that he tried to test Bob's hearing, he realizes that he really never got any info on it.\rLater on, George arrives at Jerry's apartment and asks if Hallie may be an 'it'.  Jerry replies saying that she could very well be an 'it' because she is a great individual.  George is excited about this, as it will allow him to double date with everyone. \n"}, {"text": "Who brings the Friar's Club jacket to the dry cleaner's?", "correct": "Kramer", "options": ["Elaine", "George", "Jerry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKramer.\n\n\tJerry realizes he needs to bring back the jacket, but he can't seem to find it.  When Kramer stops by, he tells the story about it.  He ended up dozing off (having had only an hour and twenty minutes sleep over the past three days) and waking up in a garbage pile wearing the jacket since he took it with him. He left it at the cleaners where Jerry could pick it up at six.  Jerry decides to pick it up before going to see the Flying Sandos Brothers at the circus.  George is able to get him into the show because Hallie organized the production.  At this time, Elaine tries a bit of an experiment while Bob is working. She sneaks up behind him at his desk and tries to talk dirty to see if he responds.  He doesn't do anything, but Mr. Peterman walks by during the ordeal and hears the whole thing. \n"}, {"text": "George volunteers Jerry to give his jacket to the Flying Sardo Brothers.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJerry rushes to the performance and nearly arrives late because his jacket took a bit of extra time at the dry cleaners.

At first, Jerry refuses, but after the crowd cheers him on, he decides to help out.  The performer ends up simply throwing his Friar's Club jacket into the audience.  Meanwhile, Kramer has another date with Connie and despite his idea to go see a movie, she asks to stay at the apartment with him. As soon as they start doing anything though, he falls asleep on top of her, pinning her down.

He is really bothered by this since he has to return it to the Friar's Club, so Hallie says that she'll track it down for him.  He decides to go home, so Susan and George go have coffee alone.  George finds this unbearable as all that they talk about involves his shoelaces. Meanwhile, Jerry returns to his apartment to find strange men carrying Kramer out in a large sack.  They end up driving him to a bridge and throwing him into a river before he actually wakes up (with a ferry bearing down on him, no less). \n"}, {"text": "According to Kramer, why did Connie want to kill him?", "correct": "She didn't want anyone else to have him.", "options": ["She wanted to have a part of him forever.", "She didn't want to deal with leaving his apartment.", "She wanted to fulfill a lifelong dream."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe didn't want anyone else to have him.\n\n\tThe next day, Elaine gets tickets for the Sardo show from Mr. Peterman, who tells her to enjoy the show with Bob as he feels he should support their relationship.  He claims that anyone who would simply make fun of his handicap would be fired immediately, so she must have been telling the truth in the office. Meanwhile, Jerry is soured by the incident involving the jacket and declines an invitation to have dinner at George and Susan's.  He also realizes he needs to pay $800 if he doesn't return the Friar's Club jacket.  Kramer makes a reappearance as well to tell Jerry that Connie threw him into the Hudson River in a burlap sack. He deduces that she was so in love with him that she couldn't bear to let anyone else have him. \n"}, {"text": "What is on the crest of the jacket that Jerry steals from the Sardo brother?", "correct": "A moose", "options": ["A key", "A duck", "A flower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA moose.\n\n\tWhen Jerry returns to the Friar's Club, he recognizes one of the Sardo Brothers wearing what looks like his jacket.  He is forced out of the dining room though, as he is not a member yet.  When they return to the show to speak to Hallie, they run into him and he and George end up stealing his jacket from him only to discover that the emblem is different. When they realize they have the wrong jacket, they find that Hallie watched the whole thing and that she had found his jacket earlier, like she said she would.  She gives it back saying that the jacket got a bit dirty after the show so they decided to clean it up first. When they ask her to go out to coffee, she decides not to and says she'll see them at the wedding. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when Elaine tries to wear her co-worker's hearing aid?", "correct": "The fire alarm goes off", "options": ["She discovers it's a fake", "She gets caught by Mr. Peterman", "She is mistaken for a handicapped person"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe fire alarm goes off.\n\n\tWhile in the balcony at the performance, Elaine tries to have a good time, but Bob ends up coming on too strongly and she pushes him off of her.
