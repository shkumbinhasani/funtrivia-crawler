{"id": "306753", "name": "10 Question Music Quiz: Coldplay Lyrics |   Music", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "  Music A-C", "Coldplay"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth.\"\nWhat song notes these lyrics?", "correct": "The Hardest Part", "options": ["Til Kingdom Come", "Don't Panic", "Strawberry Swing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Hardest Part.\n\n\tCounted as the fourth single on the band's third album, \"X & Y\", \"The Hardest Part\" after \"Speed of Sound\", \"Fix You\", and \"Talk\".  Released as a single in 2006, the song did not reach as high on the charts as its predecessors had (though it fared better than the band's fifth single from the CD, \"What If\").  \"X & Y\" became the top-selling album of 2005 (sixth in U.S. sales) while \"The Hardest Part\" only hit #37 on one of the Billboard charts.\r The band's music video for \"The Hardest Part\", filmed at a yacht club, featured an eighty year old gymnast and her partner performing extremely dangerous stunts onstage while the band played in the background.  The video is set up as though it is being filmed for an American TV show. \n"}, {"text": "\"Soldiers, you've got to soldier on.\"\nThis is instructed in which song?", "correct": "Lovers in Japan", "options": ["Yes", "Shiver", "A Message"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLovers in Japan.\n\n\t\"Lovers in Japan\" was the fourth and final single released from the fourth Coldplay album, \"Viva la Vida\", in late 2008.  Although the single appeared on the \"Viva la Vida (or Death and All His Friends\") CD upon its initial release, it was bundled as a full song with \"Reign of Love\".  Nonetheless, when announced as a stand-alone single, the song performed extremely well on the charts.  In November 2008, the \"Osaka Sun Remix\" of \"Lovers in Japan\" was released as a track on the EP \"Prospekt's March\".  The band claims this to be more reminiscent of the live version of the song.\r The music video for \"Lovers in Japan\" features the band performing and writing words from the song with neon lights, and then using elements from their concert.  This video first premiered on iTunes. \n"}, {"text": "\"Do you feel like a puzzle?  You can't find your missing piece.\"\nChris Martin asks this question in which of the following?", "correct": "Talk", "options": ["42", "Green Eyes", "Parachutes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTalk.\n\n\tAppearing on many Billboard charts (and reaching #1 in the Hot Dance Club Play chart), \"Talk\" was released as the third single from Coldplay's \"X & Y\" album.  Though the band originally considered leaving \"Talk\" off the CD, it was nominated in 2007 for the Grammy for 'Best Rock Performance by a duo or Group with Vocals'.  Instead, a remixed version of the song won 'Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical' at the same ceremony.  The music video for \"Talk\" featured the band on another planet.  When they land, they are attacked by alien robots. \n"}, {"text": "\"I was just guessing at numbers and figures.\"\nIn which song is this line sung?", "correct": "The Scientist", "options": ["Trouble", "Yes", "A Message"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Scientist.\n\n\tAppearing on \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", Coldplay's second album, \"The Scientist\" was the second single of the CD.  The video features Chris Martin walking backwards through various settings as the song plays on.  In 2004, the video was nominated for a Grammy, losing to a Johnny Cash song instead.\r \"The Scientist\" is a song about love, quite simply, and the many people who can feel it.  Becoming quite the well-received song, the single charted at a peak of #18 on the Billboard 'Modern Rock Singles' chart.  The majority of the song is played by Chris Martin on the piano while he sings the vocals. \n"}, {"text": "\"There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street.\"\nThese lyrics begin which song?", "correct": "Life in Technicolor II", "options": ["Lhuna", "The Hardest Part", "Swallowed in the Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLife in Technicolor II.\n\n\tAlthough the original \"Life in Technicolor\" appeared as the instrumental first track on Coldplay's fourth album, \"Viva La Vida\", a second version with lyrics was released on the CD \"Prospekt's March\" in 2008.  The band realized the likelihood that this song would be released as a single, so it was left for this later-released EP and released at a later date.  All of the songs on this album were either recorded for release on \"Viva La Vida\", but were omitted from the final track list, or they were revised versions (such as the Osaka Sun Remix of \"Lovers in Japan\").\r \"Life in Technicolor II\" reached #21 on the 'Modern Rock' Billboard chart and became one of the band's most popular digital downloads.  The music video features marionette versions of the band members playing in a children's puppet show which bears a striking resemblance to one of their concerts in the \"Viva La Vida\" tour...with many more dangerous stunts. \n"}, {"text": "\"Look how they shine for you, and all the things you do.\"\nThis suggestion is mentioned in which Coldplay single?", "correct": "Yellow", "options": ["See You Soon", "Sparks", "Green Eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellow.\n\n\t\"Yellow\" is perhaps the most well-known song from Coldplay's debut CD, \"Parachutes\", released in 2000.  Getting the most radio airtime from the first album, \"Yellow\" reached #48 on the Billboard 'Hot 100' and #6 on the 'Modern Rock Tracks' charts.  Almost lulling as much as it amps up, the song is a staple at the band's concerts. The lyrics and song, according to the band, were composed one night after the band had taken the time to look at the night sky.  The song was nominated for two Grammys in 2002 but lost to Train's \"Drops of Jupiter\" and U2's \"Elevation\".  The music video features the Chris Martin walking along a cloudy beach in quite a contrast to the song. \n"}, {"text": "Which song mentions that \"birds came flying from the underground\"?", "correct": "Speed of Sound", "options": ["Twisted Logic", "Warning Sign", "Cemeteries of London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed of Sound.\n\n\tReaching #8 on the Billboard 'Hot 100', \"Speed of Sound\" was the first of a number of major singles of the band's third album, \"X&Y\".  Though nominated for two Grammys, Coldplay once more lost out to U2 (who released their \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" album around the same time).  \"Speed of Sound\", according to the band, was inspired by the music of Kate Bush. According to iTunes, \"Speed of Sound\" was their billionth downloaded song.  One of the more popular music videos of 2005, the video featured the band performing on a sound stage in front of large LED panels.  Most of the panels' shifts in colour are based on the pitch and tone of Chris Martin's vocals. \n"}, {"text": "\"Every door I ever tried was locked.\"\nIn which song is this lyric heard?", "correct": "Lost!", "options": ["Fix You", "Politik", "Daylight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLost!.\n\n\tAppearing on four different Billboard charts in 2008, \"Lost!\" became the fourth single from \"Viva La Vida\", the band's fourth album.  There are many different music videos for the song, as rather than create their own, the band asked fans to submit theirs to win concert tickets.\r Although one knows the original \"Lost!\" to include an exclamation mark at the end of its name, \"Lost?\" with a question mark is an acoustic version, \"Lost@\" is a live version of the song, \"Lost-\" is instrumental, and \"Lost+\" is a version of the song recorded with rapper Jay-Z for the release of \"Prospekt's March\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Shoot an apple off my head.\"\nWhich song contains this lyric?", "correct": "Clocks", "options": ["Violet Hill", "God Put a Smile Upon Your Face", "White Shadows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClocks.\n\n\tKnown for its piano tune, \"Clocks\" became the headlining song from the \"Rush of Blood to the Head\" album, being featured in many movie soundtracks and gaining plenty of radio airplay.  Charting on three Billboard Charts and reaching #9 on the UK Singles Chart, the song won a Grammy in 2004 for 'Record of the Year'.  The music video featured the band playing a live show in London.\rIn its debut year, the song was one of the most popular to appear on radios.  It was featured in the live action remake of \"Peter Pan\" and later appeared on the live album \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\". \n"}, {"text": "\"I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemies eyes.\"\nIn which song does Chris Martin make this claim?", "correct": "Viva La Vida", "options": ["Square One", "In My Place", "Strawberry Swing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViva La Vida.\n\n\tThe first Billboard #1 for the band (on the 'Hot 100'), \"Viva La Vida\" was the second single from the album of the same name (following \"Violet Hill\") and the first British group to do so since the Spice Girls twelve years earlier.  The song revolves around Chris Martin playing the role of a revolutionary world leader.\r The music video for this single involves the group crumbling to pieces within the canvas of a painting.  The single for the song became one of the highest-selling digital song releases of 2008.  The riff for the song was placed under scrutiny by a possible plagiarism charge, but this case was settled.  Nonetheless, it didn't stop the band from winning 'Song of the Year' at the 2009 Grammys with this song.  The CD also won 'Best Album of the Year'. \n"}]}
