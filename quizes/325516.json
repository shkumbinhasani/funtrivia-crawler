She has a great bluesy style and she's one of the most genuine contestants I've ever seen on the show. She came in second and seemed fine with it. \n"}, {"text": "My cull lunch?", "correct": "Michael Lynche", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Lynche.\n\n\t\"Big Mike,\" a new dad and a HUGE guy (a personal trainer) was one of my favorites for Top Five. He has a big, soulful voice and a warm, loving personality. He was \"saved\" by the four judges, and he made it to fourth place. \n"}, {"text": "Chiffon mug nest?", "correct": "Siobhan Magnus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSiobhan Magnus.\n\n\tNineteen that year, Siobhan has a one-of-a-kind fashion sense, and an interesting voice. She wasn't my favorite contestant, but I liked her a lot. She is from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. \n"}, {"text": "Sigh moan caw wool?", "correct": "Simon Cowell", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSimon Cowell.\n\n\t2010 was Simon's last season as an AI judge. He isn't especially polite, but I think he may have been the sharpest judge on the panel. He and Ryan Seacrest had an uncomfortably tense relationship during that season. In fact, I think Ryan may have been having a psychotic break of some kind. \n"}, {"text": "Leader wise?", "correct": "Lee Dewyze", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLee Dewyze.\n\n\tOne of my favorites for Top Three, bashful Lee came into his own during that season. I love his deep, scratchy voice and bluesy style. And he won! Wow. He was definitely the most improved contestant of the season. \n"}, {"text": "Hell Indy generous?", "correct": "Ellen Degeneres", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEllen Degeneres.\n\n\tMoonlighting from her own show, Ellen turned out to be a great judge. She was funny, insightful, and kind, though not quite as much of a pushover as Paula had been. I love her sparkling eyes. \n"}, {"text": "Hand true scar see ya?", "correct": "Andrew Garcia", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrew Garcia.\n\n\tAndrew was one of my favorites for Top Five. Sadly, though, he was voted off on April 14. From a low-income family in Moreno Valley, California, Andrew is a devoted dad. I guess he sort of lost his nerve, but he had flashes of brilliance with his unique, soulful style. \n"}, {"text": "Care ruddy owe gourd he?", "correct": "Kara Dioguardi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKara Dioguardi.\n\n\tThis was singer/songwriter Kara's second year as an AI judge. \"Singer/songwriter\" was one of her favorite terms, and she often \"wanted more\" from contestants. Still, she's got good taste and she's a fairly articulate judge. (She's very pretty, too.) \n"}, {"text": "Gay sea shames?", "correct": "Casey James", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasey James.\n\n\tSO cute! Casey was one of my favorites for Top Three. Sure enough, he came in third, which seemed exactly right to me. He's a superb guitar player and a great rock/blues/country singer. He has fabulous stage presence, too. So CUTE! Love his hair. Love his smile. He seems very natural, too. \n"}, {"text": "Page smiles?", "correct": "Paige Miles", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaige Miles.\n\n\tShe wasn't one of my favorites, but I liked Paige a lot. She's beautiful and lively, and she can really sing--especially loud rock songs like \"All Right Now\" by Bad Company. Sadly she was voted off the show on March 24. \n"}]}
