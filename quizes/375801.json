{"id": "375801", "name": "To My Daughter... Online Trivia | Thematic People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Thematic People", "Thematic Family Members"], "questions": [{"text": "In the year my daughter was born, Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa, Rwanda was devastated by a genocide and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died. Which year was it?", "correct": "1994", "options": ["1984", "1988", "1999"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1994.\n\n\tOther world events in 1994, were the arrest of O.J. Simpson for the murder of his wife, the Israel-Jordan peace treaty which was signed by Hussein I of Jordan and Israeli President Yitzhak Rabin and Brazil winning the 1994 FIFA World Cup by defeating Italy 3-2 in penalties. \r My daughter is a Capricorn, born in the year of the Dog. \n"}, {"text": "If I wanted to follow the tradition of my country in the naming of children, I would have named my daughter after my mother who had the name of the sister of Antigone, as is mentioned in the play by Sophocles. What name is that?", "correct": "Ismene", "options": ["Artemis", "Pandora", "Ellie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsmene.\n\n\tIn Sophocles' play \"Antigone\", Ismene was the sister of Antigone, Eteocles and Polynices and the daughter and half-sister of Oedipus and daughter and granddaughter of Jocasta. When Antigone decided to bury her brother Polynices against king Creon's decree, Ismene did not follow her and instead, complied with Creon's orders. Being loyal to her sister, Ismene wanted to be executed with Antigone but Antigone could not let her sister get punished for something she didn't do and committed suicide in her prison cell.\r The Greek custom in the naming of children is to name them after the grandparents, paternal for boys and maternal for girls. A lot of people in the last 20 years have opted for names from Greek mythology or Ancient history. My daughter was named after a Bactrian princess and wife of a major Greek historical figure. \n"}, {"text": "When my daughter was three and a half years old, I enrolled her in a day care center which followed the educational approach of a method developed by an Italian physician and educator. This method is mainly based on freedom within limits in an environment with special materials and experiences, where children essentially teach themselves. Who is this educator?", "correct": "Maria Montessori", "options": ["Jean Piaget", "Anne Sullivan", "A.S. Neil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaria Montessori.\n\n\tMaria Montessori's truly innovative method made her one of the most influential educators of the 20th century. The basis of her method was \"discovery learning,\" meaning that the children essentially educate themselves in an environment filled with the appropriate stimuli while the trained teachers observe and support. \r As for my daughter, she thrived in that environment, for the three years she was in it, and became a very independent and self-reliant child with a talent for math and science which the Montessori system encouraged with the proper educational material. \n"}, {"text": "Almost every night, I read stories from Greek mythology to my daughter and, to my surprise, her favorite one was Homer's \"Iliad.\" An excellent read, a bit gory for my taste, what is \"Iliad\" the story of?", "correct": "The Trojan War", "options": ["The Battle at Gordium", "The Peloponnesian War", "The Persian Wars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Trojan War.\n\n\tHomer's epic poem, the \"Iliad\", is about the ten-year war between the Greeks and the Trojans, the battles, the love-affairs, the Olympian gods that got involved and, finally, the fall of Troy and the capture and slaughter of its people. \r My daughter's mythology books had beautiful and very vivid illustrations of warriors, like Achilles, Hector and Agamemnon, scenes from the battles and the Trojan Horse which brought the end of the war. On a school trip to Mycenae, she saw Agamemnon's palace and was able to put together the stories from her mythology books and actual historical facts. \n"}, {"text": "Highly impressed by Roman history, which she partly learned through her  \"Asterix\" comics, my daughter in 5th grade asked if we could take a trip to Rome. After a one-hour flight from Athens we arrived in Rome and as a bonus, I had arranged a day-trip from Rome to a city buried under the ashes of a volcanic eruption. Where did I take her?", "correct": "Pompeii", "options": ["Taormina", "Siena", "Ostia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPompeii.\n\n\tRome is a great city for children; it's like a giant ancient theme park with delicious pizza, gelati and beautiful fountains. We took a night tour of all of Rome's monuments which my daughter will never forget. The highlight of that trip, though, was tracing the story of her comic book to Tullianum, the underground prison where the Gaul chief Vercingetorix was held after he was defeated by Julius Caesar in the battle of Alesia. He was strangled in 46 BC and his body was thrown in the river Tiber. \r In Pompeii, my daughter was most impressed by the cast of the dog who was chained by the entrance of a house and was suffocated under the ash and cinders spewing from Vesuvius. \n"}, {"text": "Part of my daughter's education was to learn to read music and play a musical instrument. Which was the instrument she chose to play if I tell you that, jokingly, we called her the \"New Vanessa Mae\"?", "correct": "Violin", "options": ["Oboe", "Piano", "Flute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViolin.\n\n\tVanessa Mae is a very popular British violinist of Thai descent who has abandoned her strict classical approach for a more popular interpretation of a classical music performance, both in appearance and style. She usually performs with an electric violin, dressed more like a rock star than a classical musician. Her talent is undeniable but she has had critical reception from the music world.\r Alas, in my daughter's case, the talent just wasn't there. She laboriously studied for ten years but her heart was never in it. The one thing she enjoyed the most from her music education was the ability to organize and direct her school's choir and play her violin in every school event. She was very happy in doing that and so were we! \n"}, {"text": "When my daughter was twelve years old, she asked for a pet. She wanted a puppy but, being a cat person all my life, I vetoed the decision and we adopted a beautiful black kitten from a litter from her teacher's cat. We named him Tiye, a regal name which belonged to a queen in a country where cats were worshipped. Which country was that?", "correct": "Egypt", "options": ["Norway", "Thailand", "Mexico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEgypt.\n\n\tQueen Tiye was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep the III, the mother of Akhenaten and grandmother of Tutankhamun. She lived between 1398 and 1338 BC and her mummy was discovered and identified as the \"Elder Lady\" in the Valley of the Kings. Her beautiful portrait head can be seen in the Altes Museum in Berlin.\r Our Tiye came to us almost 3 weeks old and we took him to the vet who proclaimed him a sweet little \"girl\", so we named him accordingly with the regal name of an Egyptian Queen. On our second visit, the vet changed his mind and Queen Tiye turned out to be a boy, after all. The name stayed, we just eliminated the word \"Queen\" before it. And we also got a new vet. \n"}, {"text": "My daughter had asthma as a young child and the doctor's instructions were to expose her to sports and outdoors activities as much as possible. She tried a number of different sports like swimming, water polo, ballet, volleyball and track and field but she was utterly unhappy in all of them. Until, in sixth grade, she found a sport she liked and she's devoted to it, even today. Which is this sport that involves a helmet, special boots, pants and gloves and good balance?", "correct": "Horseback riding", "options": ["Bowling", "Cycling", "Pilates"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorseback riding.\n\n\tEquestrianism is a very old human activity with the first horse being ridden in approximately 6000 BC, in the Eurasian steppes. As a sport, it was present in the Ancient Olympic Games in the form of chariot racing. It became a sport in the Modern Olympics in 1900 and it includes three events, 'dressage,' 'show jumping' and 'eventing.'\r At six, my daughter had quite a dramatic first experience with horseback riding, when her horse threw her on a pile of manure during her third lesson. It took her six years to return but she did and thoroughly enjoys riding now. She even works part-time as an assistant in a therapeutic horseback riding facility, in the town where she lives. \n"}, {"text": "My daughter's high school has been running an exchange program with a high school from another European country, for 19 years. In April of their junior year, 30 students arrive in Athens from this European country and stay with the families of the Greek students for a week, attending classes with them, sharing their family life and sightseeing. In September of their senior year, the same number of Greek students travel to northern Europe and the experience is repeated. The girl who stayed with us that year was named Mari\u00eblle, lived in a small town near Utrecht and crossed canals while riding her bike to school every day. Which country was she from?", "correct": "The Netherlands", "options": ["France", "Cyprus", "Hungary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Netherlands.\n\n\tMy daughter's Netherlands educational trip involved riding bikes to school with the Dutch students, visiting the amazing dikes and polders on the North Sea shores, a trip to Amsterdam and the Van Gogh Museum and going out with their Dutch friends.\r I found this school activity one of the most positive experiences my daughter had during her school years. The children communicated in English, were exposed to everyday and school life in a different country and learned to eat liver sandwiches in The Netherlands and gyros with pita bread in Greece. \n"}, {"text": "In 2012, my daughter took the Greek State University Entrance Exams and scored high enough in the six required courses, to get accepted to the Department of Production Engineering and Management of a Greek university which is established on the biggest Greek island and home of the Minoan civilization. Which island is that?", "correct": "Crete", "options": ["Lefkada", "Skiathos", "Paros"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrete.\n\n\tThe Technical University of Crete, established in Chania in 1977, offers 5-year undergraduate programs in Environmental, Production and Management, Electronics and Mineral Resources Engineering and Architecture. It also offers MSc and PhD programs. \r Chania is one of the most beautiful Greek cities with the Old Venetian Town and the Venetian Harbor as major attractions. It is also one of the most popular tourist destinations in Crete. Sightseeing in the Prefecture of Chania would include the Samaria Gorge, the island of Gramvoussa, the beaches of Elafonissi and Falasarna and the village of Sfakia. The Palace of King Minos at Knossos is 131 km (81.4 miles) away. \rMy daughter loves living, studying and working there and has definitely settled nicely into her life, making me a happy mother. \n"}]}
