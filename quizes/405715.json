A mother and two daughters prepare for dinner and take their seat at the table while the father returns home from work with terrible news.  They have an hour, maybe, before they need to leave.  They don't want to leave, but they must.  They rush to the car, grabbing their weapons on their way out. They bring the floppy drive with them-- it's what they came for.  As they drive off, the police set up road blocks.  They take their vehicle to an open field and load into a hidden plane.  As the cops close in, they race to take off, barely managing to ascend into the sky at the last moment. They don't land until they reach Cuba.  It's there that the mother, actually Russian spy Melina Vostokoff, is taken to the hospital for her gunshot wound.  The father, Alexei Shostakov, hands over the intel he took.  The girls, Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova, worry about needing to go back to where they came from.  The girls are subsequently sedated, taken away, and separated, with Natasha being sent to the Red Room. \n"}, {"text": "Yelena is broken free of her training when she comes into contact with a specially-created dust of what colour?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Blue", "White", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tTwenty-one years later, Natasha is being hunted for violating the Sokovia Accords.  Being made an example amongst the other Avengers, she's contacted by Thaddeus Ross and asked to turn herself in as most of the other defectors-- save for Steve Rogers-- have been taken into custody and sent to the Raft, the maximum security prison in the Atlantic.  Special forces search for her in Germany, but she's already long-gone, having taken herself across Europe and further away to go into hiding.\r In Morocco, Yelena Belova has her target in her sights.  Pursuing a woman on foot, they quickly come to blows in the city streets.  The battle is a quick one as Yelena gets the upper hand and mortally wounds the woman, but not before her target lets off a canister of red dust.  It works its effects immediately as Yelena comes to, recognizing her target as Oksana who, in her dying breath, asks her to free the others.  Yelena, no longer under the spell, takes the remaining canisters, removes her tracking chip, and flees the scene before her fellow agents can locate her.\r Elsewhere, the Taskmaster is activated and called into action. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Natasha go to hide from General Ross and the American government?", "correct": "Norway", "options": ["Alaska", "Morocco", "Argentina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorway.\n\n\tHiding in a worn-down trailer in rural Norway, Natasha meets with her covert contact, Rick Mason, who hands her her new identification, hardware, and information.  Amongst the items left for her are a number of sealed packages remaining from an old residence in Budapest; she isn't aware that, amongst them, is the case of red dust containers.\r That evening, Natasha's generator fails and she needs to drive into town to replenish her fuel canister.  As she drives, she's intercepted; someone fires an explosive at her car and it crashes, teetering over the edge of a bridge.  The Taskmaster, with little effort, locates her, and she has to think fast to escape her vehicle with her life.  The two fight, both of them hitting the same moves and stances with eerie similarity before the Taskmaster turns their attention to the vials in her car.  Natasha gets the case first, but the foe kicks her into the freezing river below.  Fortunately, she emptied the case.\r When Natasha resurfaces downriver, she looks at the vials and the item nestled within them-- a pair of photos of herself and Yelena. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Dreykov's daughter?", "correct": "Antonia", "options": ["Sofia", "Oksana", "Katarina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntonia.\n\n\tThe clues lead Natasha to Budapest where Yelena has been laying low in an old apartment building.  Natasha arms herself before entering and reuniting with her sister.  Neither of them know if they can trust one another, but it's clear after a few moments of tension and rough fighting that they are, at the very least, on the same side.  Their fight turns into argument, especially when Natasha reveals that she brought the vials with her.  Yelena explains that they contain a potent gas that's meant to counter the effects of chemical subjugation.  It immunizes the user from mind control.  The conversation takes a turn however when Yelena mentions she thought she'd eventually be hearing some news about Captain America-- or similar-- finally taking down the Red Room.  That can't be true though, at least according to Natasha; the Red Room was destroyed years ago.  She and Clint Barton destroyed it and killed Dreykov and his daughter, Antonia, before she defected to S.H.I.E.L.D.  Yelena suggests she shouldn't be so naive.\r The two have to stop their conversation short when the apartment is invaded by Black Widow operatives.  One pursues them up and over the building before catching up to the siblings.  She falls from a great height in the chase, but her injuries result in termination.  Natasha can only watch as the operative is killed by a remote third party.\r Natasha and Yelena flee into the Budapest streets on the back of a motorbike but are intercepted by the Taskmaster and the other Black Widows.  After stealing and crashing a car, they descend into the Budapest subway with the Taskmaster in close pursuit, only managing to get away leaving a fake trail and hiding away in the vents above the tracks. \n"}, {"text": "Natasha and Yelena manage to free Shostakov from prison, but not before one of which of these occurs?", "correct": "Avalanche", "options": ["Fire tornado", "Tsunami", "Earthquake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvalanche.\n\n\tNatasha and Yelena come to terms with their situation.  The antidote vials are all that's left.  While Natasha was trained through psychological means, Yelena was influenced by chemical means, and Dreykov continues to kill and train and kill and train to expand his reach.  Their next plan of action though, is to locate Dreykov, and to do that they need to secure a flight (through Rick Mason).  It proves difficult, if only because General Ross is sniffing around.  Their destination?  Russia.\r Their former father-- at least their fake father-- is found in prison.  Alexei Shostakov, the Red Guardian, arrives for mail call to find a Red Guardian action figure waiting for him, and inside that is an earpiece that Natasha and Yelena use to guide him out of jail.  With his super strength, it should be easy for him to break out, especially when he sees his girls...and their firepower.  But things don't go so easily when a prison riot breaks out and Yelena triggers an avalanche in the surrounding mountains. \n"}, {"text": "Melina Vostokoff holds what notable profession?", "correct": "Scientist", "options": ["Human trafficker", "Talk show host", "Author"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScientist.\n\n\tThe reunion doesn't go as planned, especially when Natasha and Yelena ask Shostakov about the Red Room.  He doesn't look fondly on the three years in Ohio and he doesn't know where the Red Room really is.  What he does know, however, is where Melina Vostokoff, their former mother, might be hiding, and as a scientist she worked much closer with Dreykov than he ever did.  And so they head onward towards Saint Petersburg.\r Melina, living alone in the countryside outside the city, stops herself from shooting her visitors, partly out of surprise but mostly out of love.  She opens the gate, brings them in, and pours a drink.  The four of them, together again for the first time in decades, take a seat at the dinner table.  Shostakov even dons his old Red Guardian uniform (though it barely fits).  Of course, there's unfinished business. \n"}, {"text": "Melina, at her home outside of Saint Petersburg, tests chemicals on which of these animals?", "correct": "Pigs", "options": ["Chickens", "Horses", "Cows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPigs.\n\n\tMelina reveals that she's been working for years under Dreykov.  As one of his leading scientists, her job was to create the mind-controlling chemicals that would be used to manage the Black Widows, and she was able to do that with the information obtained from what was then Hydra.  It removed free will and the control would help Dreykov rule the world.  Natasha calls out both Shostakov and Melina for being idiots and cowards, but they and Yelena all admit that they really were family despite what everything turned out to be: fake.  It takes a talk with Melina, reminiscing about their years in Ohio, to latch onto the nostalgia, but it's too late.  Melina, not realizing what she might have done to her daughters, already contacted the Red Room; they would be there any minute.\r Sure enough, the Black Widows arrive and infiltrate the building, subduing Shostakov with tranquilizers while Melina knocks out both her daughters just in time for the Taskmaster's arrival. \n"}, {"text": "The Red Room is actually located in which of these spots?", "correct": "In the sky", "options": ["Under the sea", "Underground", "In space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the sky.\n\n\tMelina and the Taskmaster bring their captives to Dreykov's aerial base, the Red Room, high in the clouds.  While Black Widows train downstairs, Melina goes straight to Dreykov's office.  Both Shostakov and Natasha end up in cells while Yelena, placed in an operating room, is expected to have her brain removed and examined.  In his office, however, Dreykov realizes the truth quickly-- we wasn't talking to Melina at all.  She and Natasha switched places, technologically-advanced disguises.  He removes hers while Melina allows herself and Shostakov to escape their cells and alerts Yelena to the blade hidden in her belt strap.  Fortunately, Natasha also has a tracker, and when she activates it upon arriving, Ross will find her.\r In Dreykov's office, Natasha asks the question she needs the answer to; 'what was her mother's name?'  Dreykov struggles to give an answer and she asks if he feels anything, especially given that she killed his daughter.  But that's not true-- the Taskmaster has been Antonia the entire time.  When the bomb exploded in Budapest it nearly killed her, but with a chip implanted in the back of her neck, Dreykov was able to keep her alive.  Able to use the technology inside her, she can mimic anyone she watches-- even the Avengers.  Dreykov, however, sends Antonia away to take care of Melina.\r It gives Natasha the perfect opportunity to kill Dreykov, but she's quick to find the failsafe in Dreykov's machinations.  When she pulls a weapon on him, she finds herself unable to strike him.  It is, as he explains, a pheromone that he's exuding.  He build a lock into every Black Widow to protect himself and to control each from his office.  She's powerless to kill him. \n"}, {"text": "Natasha is able to overcome the pheromone lock by which means?", "correct": "By breaking her nose", "options": ["By stopping breathing", "By activating his control panel", "By hacking the Red Room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy breaking her nose.\n\n\tMelina commences the landing sequence for the Red Room, but Dreykov catches her and locks her away remotely.  Natasha, calling Dreykov out for his cowardice, eggs him on until he lashes out, punching her in the face until she hits the ground.  It's all part of Natasha's plan though-- the more he hits her nose, the sooner she's able to sever the nerves therein, and fight back.\r Melina, unable to properly shut down the Red Room, creates a controlled crash by blowing up the engine.  She reunites with Shostakov and the two are able to lock Antonia into a cell.  Yelena, meanwhile, finds the training room and arms herself to face off against the other Widows.  She's not quick enough; most of the Widows find Natasha in the office and begin to overwhelm her.  The fight ends when Yelana arrives and unleashes the red dust vials, freeing the operatives. \n"}, {"text": "Who defeats Dreykov by destroying his plane?", "correct": "Yelena", "options": ["Natasha", "Melina", "Shostakov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYelena.\n\n\tWhile the Widows escape, Natasha logs into Dreykov's computer and commences a data transfer of his console's contents.  The labs are destroyed beneath her as the Red Room crashes to the ground and in her escape, she manages to nab two remaining vials of red dust before jumping free of the structure.  Shostakov and Melina board a jet and prepare to escape, but they wait as long as possible for their daughters.  It's not long enough as they're forced off the runway, but Melina changes course and turns around.\r Natasha, struggling to escape, finds herself inside the prison room to see Antonia locked in.  She opens the door to free her knowing that she plans to pursue her, but their imminent fight is cut short.  Both Yelena and Natasha make their way to the runway but Yelena reaches Dreykov's plane first.  Though Natasha tries to stop her, Yelena sabotages the ship at the cost of her own survival, killing the creator of the Widows before hurtling off the Red Room.  Natasha, grabbing a parachute, leaps off the side and saves her sister by placing it on her back.\r The fight's not over though.  Natasha, pursued by Antonia, continues to plummet and the two of them, locked together, hit the ground.  They battle in close combat, but it comes to an end when Natasha takes off the Taskmaster's helmet and uses the penultimate vial of red dust to bring Antonia back to her senses.\r On the ground, Shostakov and Melina reunite with their daughters as the cavalry arrives.  The rest of Natasha's family head out on the run, but before they go, Natasha hands Yelena the last vial to reawaken the remaining Widows.  The other Widows arrive to collect them, Antonia included, to leave no one behind.\r Natasha, however, is picked up by General Ross.  Two weeks later, she rides off to meet with Rick Mason one last time.  This time, he gets her a quinjet-- all the better to head out to collect the Avengers from the Raft. \n"}]}
