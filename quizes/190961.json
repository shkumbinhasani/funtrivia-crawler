What was the title of the first film featuring Grace Kelly?", "correct": "Fourteen Hours", "options": ["Road to Bali", "Kind Hearts and Coronets", "Oliver Twist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFourteen Hours.\n\n\t'Fourteen Hours' is about a man who threatens suicide by standing on a ledge for, you guessed it, fourteen hours.\r Kelly appeared for the first time onscreen in the 1951 film 'Fourteen Hours', directed by Henry Hathaway.  She is featured alongside Richard Basehart, Barbara Bel Geddes and Agnes Moorehead, among others (including the screen debuts of Ossie Davis and Jeffrey Hunter as well). \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps Grace Kelly's big splash came in 1952 when she appeared alongside which of these Hollywood legends in the classic western 'High Noon'?", "correct": "Gary Cooper", "options": ["Gregory Peck", "John Wayne", "Clark Gable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Cooper.\n\n\tGrace Kelly's performance in 'High Noon' as the newly married wife of Gary Cooper is simply unforgettable.  In 'High Noon' Grace plays Amy Kane, a Quaker who believes powerfully in non-violence.  By the end of the film she is forced to use violent means to assist her husband Will Kane, recently retired marshal of Hadleyville. \n"}, {"text": "Grace Kelly's next screen appearance came in 1953 when she starred alongside Clark Gable and Ava Gardner in what jungle adventure film?", "correct": "Mogambo", "options": ["Wild Women", "Elephant Walk", "Congo Maisie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMogambo.\n\n\t'Mogambo' is revolves around four Americans in Africa and the romantic relationships that develop amongst them. \r In 'Mogambo', Grace Kelly appears as Linda Nordley, the wife of an antrhopologist played by Donald Sinden.

How many of her films were directed by that outstanding British auteur?", "correct": "3", "options": ["5", "6", "4"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3.\n\n\tJoint efforts between Hitchcock and Kelly include: 'Dial M for Murder', 'Rear Window' and 'To Catch a Thief'.  It's no surprise that Hitchcock always considered Kelly to be among his favorite actresses to work for, and their partnership may have continued had Kelly not off and got herself married. \n"}, {"text": "Grace Kelly's first collaboration with Hitchcock came in the 1954 film 'Dial M for Murder'.  In this film, Kelly plays the wife of a man who formerly played which sport?", "correct": "Tennis", "options": ["Baseball", "Boxing", "Golf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTennis.\n\n\tIn Kelly's first collaboration with Hitchcock whe plays Margot Mary Wendice, wife of former tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland).  One thing to notice about the film (an example of Hitchcock's technical brilliance), watch how the colors of Kelly's clothing change as the film progresses. \n"}, {"text": "In another Hitchcock film, also released in 1954, Grace Kelly plays the elegant Lisa Fremont, lady-love to a wheelchair bound photographer named L.B. Jefferies, portrayed by Jimmy Stewart.  What is this masterpiece of a film called?", "correct": "Rear Window", "options": ["Family Plot", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", "Notorious"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRear Window.\n\n\tIn 'Rear Window', the Jefferies character, trapped as he is in his wheelchair, becomes a voyeur by looking outside his apartment's rear window.  This leads to his entanglement in a mystery involving one of his neighbors.\r Nearly everything about this film is perfect, from Hitchcock's brilliant directing to the precise cinematography of Robert Burks, and from the impeccable set design to the unceasingly good performances by Stewart, Kelly and a marvelous supporting cast.  Kelly's graceful (no pun intended) performance here really stands out. \n"}, {"text": "Grace Kelly was nominated for two Academy Awards.  Did she win either time?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tKelly was nominated for an Best Actress in a Supporting Role award in 1953 for 'Mogambo', and again for a Best Actress in a Leading Role Oscar for her 1954 performance in 'The Country Girl'.

During which war was this 1955 film set?", "correct": "Korean War", "options": ["World War II", "World War I", "Spanish-American War"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKorean War.\n\n\tDirected by Mark Robson, 'The Bridges at Toko-Ri' also included Frederic March and Mickey Rooney among its all-star cast.  The story for the film was derived from the James Michener novel of the same name.  The chemistry between Holden and Kelly is good, which perhaps makes sense when one considers that this was the second time the two had been paired together in film (the first being 'The Country Girl'). \n"}, {"text": "In which of Grace Kelly's films did she play a fictional princess (prior to her becoming a real one, of course)?", "correct": "The Swan", "options": ["Green Fire", "To Catch a Thief", "High Society"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Swan.\n\n\tOddly enough, just prior to becoming Princess Grace, Grace Kelly played Princess Alexander opposite Alec Guinness' Prince Albert in the 1956 film 'The Swan', a film that documents a romantic relationship that develops between them.\r This was her second to last film release, coming just prior to 'High Society', a remake of 'The Philadelphia Story', also featuring Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. \n"}, {"text": "After her marriage to Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, Grace Kelly never acted again in a Hollywood film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tGrace Kelly was offered a number of roles after 1956, and indeed was slated to work on several projects at the time, but turned down or abandoned all of these projects.  She appeared as herself, the hostess for a couple of films intended to promote charitable causes (for example, 'Poppies Are Also Flowers' from 1966), but never acted again.
