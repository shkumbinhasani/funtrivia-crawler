{"id": "364409", "name": "The Ealing Comedies - \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\" Quiz | Movies | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "T", "Tg - Tm Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "The Titfield branch line links the fictional locations of the village of Titfield with which larger town?", "correct": "Mallingford", "options": ["Peterborough", "Hungerford", "Castle Cary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMallingford.\n\n\tIn the opening scene the little branch line locomotive is waiting at Titfield station for local squire Gordon Chesterton, played by Ealing regular John Gregson, who wishes to travel to the market in nearby Mallingford; as the train departs, a member of the station staff affixes a poster to the notice board announcing that the line between Titfield and Mallingford has been selected for closure by the Ministry of Transport.  Mallingford is also the venue for the public meeting at which the future of the line is discussed with a civil servant from the Ministry of Transport.  \rIn reality the village of Titfield takes its name from a combination of two villages in Surrey, Titsey and Limpsfield.  Filming itself took place in the south western county of Somerset with the station in the village of Monkton Combe being used for those scenes that required a station setting; those scenes requiring a village setting being filmed at Freshford, a quaint village also located in Somerset. \n"}, {"text": "In an early scene which takes place in Reverend Samuel Weech's sitting room, he mentions what it is that makes the Titfield branch line special.  What did Sam Weech say was so special about it?  ", "correct": "That it was the oldest branch line in the world", "options": ["That it was the only high speed railway line in the county", "That the route ran entirely downhill", "That the route was partly electrified"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat it was the oldest branch line in the world.\n\n\tIt is during this meeting between Sam Weech, Gordon Chesterton, (the grandson of the engineer who originally constructed the Titfield branch line), and Mallingford's town clerk, Mr George Blakeworth, that the three of them discuss the idea of buying the railway and running it as a private enterprise.  When Gordon Chesterton sadly exclaims that the railway line is finished, Sam Weech says that it was such a shame that the oldest branch line in the world should end in such a manner. \n"}, {"text": "Which object or objects can be seen on the table in front of the balustrade to the stairs down into the Reverend Weech's sitting room?", "correct": "A model of an early steam locomotive", "options": ["A railway station nameplate", "A display collection of guard whistles", "A large handheld lantern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA model of an early steam locomotive.\n\n\tThere is a large scale model of an early steam locomotive on Sam Weech's sitting room table.   The model is of Robert Stephenson's steam locomotive, the 'North Star', an engine built during 1837 and which was used by Brunel's Great Western Railway Company.  \r It is clear that those present at this informal gathering have the enthusiasm and the technical know-how to run the railway... But how are they to raise the necessary funding? \n"}, {"text": "Mr Valentine, played by Ealing regular Stanley Holloway, is persuaded to bankroll the railway company.  He is convinced to invest ten thousand pounds in the railway by the fact that there will be a bar serving alcohol available on the train?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\t\"You can write your own timetable!\" exclaimed Gordon Chesterton.\r \"My very dear sir, you can write your own cheque!\" replied an excited Mr Valentine...\r A very wealthy local man, Mr Valentine is saddened by the fact that there are no public houses open early in the morning in the village; to say that he enjoyed a tipple would be an understatement!  After being informed that it would be perfectly legal for a railway company to operate a bar on any of its trains once they are under way, the promise of a such a facility, which will open at thirteen minutes to nine each morning - except on Sundays, finally encourages Mr Valentine to write his cheque for ten thousand pounds. \n"}, {"text": "During an argument in the public house between the Reverend Weech and Dan Taylor, what does Mr Valentine state that Dan Taylor was formerly employed as on the railways?", "correct": "A platelayer", "options": ["A ticket office clerk", "A fireman", "A signalman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA platelayer.\n\n\tAfter Valentine had been convinced to invest money in the railway he introduces his friend Dan Taylor, a former platelayer, to Gordon Chesterton and Sam Weech as a prospective engine driver; much to the chagrin of Sam as he had already decided that driving the engine was to be his job!  An exchange ensues between Sam and Dan in which they fire a series of questions at each other but this simply results in stalemate; they both seem to be as well qualified as each other and with this Mr Valentine, now technically the owner of the railway, declares a draw and announces that they will both drive the train together. A 'platelayer' was labourer that was responsible for laying and maintaining the rails on which the locomotives ran. \n"}, {"text": "As a consequence of the villagers of Titfield determining to run the railway line, they find themselves in direct competition with Pearce & Crump Limited.  What kind of transport operators are Pearce & Crump?", "correct": "Bus company", "options": ["Car hire company", "Tour operators", "Taxi firm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBus company.\n\n\tWith the announcement by British Railways of the impending closure of the Titfield to Mallingford line, the proprietors of Pearce and Crump Ltd, the local bus company, are hoping to monopolise the transport link between Titfield and Mallingford.  Stopping at nothing to ensure the closure of the line and the destruction of the locomotive and rolling stock, at first they attempt to sway public opinion in their favour during the public meeting in Mallingford, but when this fails, their attempts at sabotage take a darker, but still comedic, turn. \n"}, {"text": "With which other forms of transport does the railway duel with during their first run?", "correct": "A steamroller and flatbed truck", "options": ["A combine harvester and tractor", "An articulated truck and coach", "An armoured car and bicycle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA steamroller and flatbed truck.\n\n\tIn their first attempt at sabotage, Pearce and Crump aim at delaying the locomotive by blocking a level crossing with a broken down truck loaded with rubble.  As the truck is rammed clear of the crossing by the locomotive, Harry Hawkins, played by comedy great Sidney James, arrives with his steamroller. Pearce and Crump attempt to enlist his help in their duel with the train; he is reluctant to help at first, especially after his girlfriend threatens never to speak to him again should he do so. Harry Hawkins has no particular fondness for the railway or those that run it and decides to assist Pearce and Crump in their effort. Unfortunately for Hawkins, his steamroller is no match for the power of the locomotive and this too is forced from the tracks and tipped over by the steam engine. \n"}, {"text": "Dan Taylor, the grouchy old retired railway worker and poacher, lives in what sort of accommodation, originally connected with the railways?", "correct": "Railway passenger carriage", "options": ["Converted signals box", "Disused water tower", "Station ticket office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRailway passenger carriage.\n\n\tThe irascible Dan Taylor resides in an old yellow railway carriage located in a field very close to the railway line.  During the night prior to the final inspection by the representative of the Ministry of Transport, Pearce, Crump and Hawkins derail the locomotive and its carriages, sending them all tumbling down an embankment close to where Dan lives.Ever the opportunist, Dan retrieves a number of bottles of scotch from the wreckage and takes them home in order to get drunk.  The locomotive itself is replaced in time for the inspection but the rolling stock proves to be more difficult to do so; until the group are reminded that Dan Taylor lives in an old railway carriage and they decide to commandeer it for use the following morning! \n"}, {"text": "After the water tank on which the railway depends is sabotaged, how do the locomotive crew and passengers provide sufficient water for the engine, thus enabling it to continue on its way?", "correct": "They draw water from a nearby river", "options": ["They call for assistance from the local Fire Brigade", "They open the tanks during a heavy rain storm", "They use bottled water from the bar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey draw water from a nearby river.\n\n\tIt is fortunate that the railway line runs close by to the course of a small river.  The passengers alight and race to a group of nearby houses collecting anything they can that will hold water.  They then form a chain between the river and the stationary locomotive and refill its tanks with river water. \n"}, {"text": "\"This is dreadful\" stated the Reverend Weech, \"The next thing you know we shall be nationalised\"!  A discussion about which aspect of running the railway instigated this comment?", "correct": "Making a profit", "options": ["Over-charging passengers", "Failing to stick to the timetable", "Adopting a closed shop policy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaking a profit.\n\n\tDue to the success of the railway and its growing reputation, large numbers of visitors are buying tickets to use it; and everything offered for sale in the buffet car!  As the future of the railway is being discussed at a meeting of the board, Emily, an elderly lady and the vicar's housekeeper played by actress Edie Martin, states that the railway is already running at a profit.  It is this revelation that leads a surprised Sam Weech to voice this concern. \n"}, {"text": "In which important civic position was the character Mr George Blakeworth, played by Ealing regular Naunton Wayne, employed?", "correct": "Mallingford Town Clerk", "options": ["Police Superintendent", "School headmaster", "Village postmaster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMallingford Town Clerk.\n\n\tAt first, George Blakeworth, who lives in Titfield village but works in Mallingford, finds himself unable to apply any influence due to his position; although later he comes over to the side of those running the railway.  After a request to merge with the railway company made by Crump is turned down, it is Blakeworth, sitting in their coach, that overhears their plot to \"finish the railway once and for all\".  Later that evening, Blakeworth makes his way to where the steam engine is laid up overnight and becomes trapped on board the train as the saboteurs carry out their dastardly plan. \n"}, {"text": "After the demise of their steam engine, the villagers turn to the museum in Mallingford and, with the assistance of George Blakeworth, commandeer 'The Titfield Thunderbolt', in order to undergo the Ministry of Transport inspection the following day?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter Pearce, Crump and Hawkins succeeds in derailing and severely damaging the steam engine, the villagers return from the scene of the crime dismayed that they now have no chance whatsoever of being ready for inspection the following day.  Returning home, Sam Weech falls into a fitful sleep and suddenly realises that their salvation is sitting in Mallingford Museum; a very, very old steam locomotive known as 'The Titfield Thunderbolt'! \n"}, {"text": "Dan Taylor is unavailable to drive the engine on the day of the inspection, and so the Reverend Weech is assisted by a visitor and friend.  Who is this friend?", "correct": "Oliver Matthews, the Bishop of Welchester", "options": ["Mr George Blakeworth, Town Clerk", "Gordon Chesterford, the local Squire", "Harry Hawkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliver Matthews, the Bishop of Welchester.\n\n\tThe Bishop of Welchester, a railway enthusiast played by Godfrey Tearle, had heard of the attempt by the villagers to run their own railway and visits his old friend Sam to find out how things are progressing.  On hearing that Dan Taylor had been arrested for stealing a train the night before, he offers to act as the fireman and, together, the pair pilot the locomotive and its carriages to Mallingford. \n"}, {"text": "What occurs that almost jeopardises the successful inspection run by the Titfield locomotive and its crew at the very start?", "correct": "The transportation of prisoners by the police", "options": ["An accident delaying the arrival of the railway inspector", "The railway inspector loses his stopwatch", "Thieves steal the locomotive's coal supply"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe transportation of prisoners by the police.\n\n\tAfter the derailment and loss of their locomtive, Dan Taylor and Mr Valentine embark on a particularly heavy drinking session and decide to steal a replacement engine from the marshalling yards in Mallingford; they very nearly succeed but are arrested by the police after crashing the stolen engine on their way back to Titfield. After being held overnight by the police they are both to be transported to court in Mallingford by police van.  During the drive to Mallingford, the police van is involved in a collision with the bus being driven by Pearce and Crump.  Convinced that the police were on their way to arrest them for sabotaging the train, they attempt an escape but are arrested. During their arrest they let it slip that they were responsible for the sabotage of the train.  With the police van out of action the only way that they can all be transported to Mallingford is by train... The departure of The Titfield Thunderbolt is delayed while the prisoners are embarked and so, due to a makeshift linkage, the eventful journey from Titfield to Mallingford begins! \n"}, {"text": "How is the success of 'The Titfield Thunderbolt' celebrated by the crew, the passengers and other railway personnel at Mallingford Station?", "correct": "With the sounding of steam whistles", "options": ["With the smoking of fine Cuban cigars", "With a buffet and drinks party on the platform", "With prayers and a brief sermon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith the sounding of steam whistles.\n\n\tDuring the journey to Titfield, the ministry inspector orders a braking test which, unfortunately puts too much strain on the linkage between the locomotive and the rolling stock and the two part company.  Unbeknown to the inspector, other passengers aboard the train quietly alight and push the rolling stock along the track until they meet with the locomotive which had stopped to take on water. With a suitable linkage provided by Hawkins from his steamroller, the train makes much better headway and proceeds onwards to Mallingford, success and the issue of an operators licence!  This final scene was filmed at Bristol Temple Meads railway station, the oldest and largest in Bristol. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it was the first station to be designed by him for his Great Western Railway and was opened on the 31st of August 1840. \n"}]}
