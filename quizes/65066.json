Complete its title: The Order of St. __________.", "correct": "Sebastian", "options": ["Bartholomew", "Michael", "Christopher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSebastian.\n\n\tSebastian, incidentally, is the patron saint of archers, soldiers, and athletes. \n"}, {"text": "As Vincent first encounters Mary Corleone (Sofia Coppola) at her father's party, he has no idea who she really is.

She explains that the money will be used for art grants, medical research funding, and the general restoration of Sicily.

Which one?", "correct": "Connie", "options": ["Sonny", "Michael", "Fredo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnie.\n\n\tIt's stated several times that Connie (Talia Shire) is Altobello's goddaughter.

What profession is Tony leaving law school to pursue?", "correct": "opera singer", "options": ["chef", "actor", "film director"], "explanation": "\n\n\nopera singer.\n\n\tTony finds success pretty quickly, too -- he's starring in an opera in Sicily by the end of the film. \n"}, {"text": "Adopted Corleone brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is not in 'The Godfather Part III,' but his son is. What is the name of Tom's son?", "correct": "Andrew", "options": ["Paul", "Michael", "Vito"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrew.\n\n\tAndrew Hagen (John Savage) is a priest, and Michael secures him a position at the Vatican.

He was written out of the film at the last minute and 'replaced' by a new character, B.J. Harrison (George Hamilton). \n"}, {"text": "Local hoodlum Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) presents Michael with an award as well -- a plaque declaring him 'Italian-American Man of the Year' by an organization named after an Italian inventor.

Did Michael tell her at some point? Did she deduce it on her own? Did the rumors (mentioned by Mary to Vincent) simply ring true to Kay? At any rate, Connie reveals in conversation with Michael that she still believes that Fredo drowned -- she seems to have no idea that Michael was behind his death. \n"}, {"text": "Kay Adams has remarried since divorcing Michael. What is her husband's name?", "correct": "Douglas", "options": ["Richard", "David", "Gerald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouglas.\n\n\tWe see Douglas Michelson (Brett Halsey) at the party in the beginning of the film, but he is unable to make it to Sicily for his stepson's opera debut. \n"}, {"text": "Mosca, the Sicilian assassin hired by Don Altobello to kill Michael, has a young assistant -- possibly his son -- who imitates a certain animal on command. What animal is it?", "correct": "a donkey", "options": ["a monkey", "a dog", "a bird"], "explanation": "\n\n\na donkey.\n\n\tApparently the kid's famous for his donkey imitation, since Don Altobello asks to see it the moment he encounters him.

Which of the following is NOT one of them?", "correct": "A man who murders his own brother", "options": ["First cousins in love", "A man who bites off the ear of another man", "An elaborate street festival"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA man who murders his own brother.\n\n\t'Cavalleria Rusticana' is, according to Coppola's commentary, something of an inspiration for 'The Godfather Part III.' In it, an illegitimate child declares his love for his first cousin (shades of Vincent and Mary) and bites the ear off of his enemy (just like Vincent and Joey Zasa) in the shadow of a street festival quite similar to the one where Vincent killed Joey. No mention is made of fratricide, apparently. \n"}, {"text": "Don Licio Luchessi (Enzo Ributti), the villain in the Roman government, is killed with a rather unusual weapon. What does Calo (Franco Citti) use to kill Luchessi?", "correct": "eyeglasses", "options": ["a pen", "the stem of a broken martini glass", "a crucifix"], "explanation": "\n\n\neyeglasses.\n\n\tCalo is searched thoroughly before being shown into Luchessi's office, so he is unable to bring a weapon with him.
