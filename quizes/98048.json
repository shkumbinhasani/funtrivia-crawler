Hawkeye, never one to waste time, busies himself getting to know a beautiful nurse named Erika Johnson.  Which future television star plays the lovely Nurse Johnson? ", "correct": "Joan Van Ark", "options": ["Suzanne Somers", "Shelley Long", "Markie Post"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoan Van Ark.\n\n\tJoan Van Ark went on to gain fame as a cast member of 'Dallas' and later 'Knots Landing'.  Before all that sordid mess (sorry, not a big fan of prime time soaps!) she was a guest star on M*A*S*H...and she had poor Hawkeye smitten. \n"}, {"text": "While in the operating room, an incident occurs.  A badly wounded Chinese soldier, about to go under sedation, climbs off of the operating table and holds off the surgical team with a weapon.  Which of these items does he hold?", "correct": "Scalpel", "options": ["Hand grenade", "Pocket knife", "Pistol"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScalpel.\n\n\tThough there were instanced when more dangerous weapons were wielded in the M*A*S*H operating room, in this case the Chinese soldier desperately grabs for and wields one of the scalpels on the operating tray near his table.  He manages to injure an orderly and Nurse Johnson before severely injuring Klinger's 39 dollar dress, causing Klinger to threaten him with a rifle!  \"Are you crazy?  You wrecked a 39 dollar dress!  Your people will pay for this!\" \n"}, {"text": "In an attempt to calm the Chinese soldier, Father Mulcahy yells something over and over, believing it to mean 'peace and friendship' in the Chinese language.  What two word phrase does he yell?", "correct": "Bung Chow", "options": ["Fong Low", "How Cheng", "Gung Long"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBung Chow.\n\n\tSorry for the crude spelling, but I tried to spell it roughly like the words that the good Father used.  According to Radar, in his report, the Father was not saying 'peace and friendhip' but rather that 'your daughter's pregnancy brings much joy to our village'.  Ha! \n"}, {"text": "Oftentimes during the early run of M*A*S*H mix-ups would occur, and we would find Frank or Margaret alone with a person they believe to be each other.  In this episode, Frank sneaks into Margaret's tent and bites which character on the shoulder, thinking that he is Margaret?", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Radar", "Hawkeye", "Trapper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to Hot Lips, Klinger decides to use her hair dryer, obscuring his head from view.  Frank sneaks in from behind and takes a little nibble of Klinger's shoulder before realizing that it's the Lebanese cross-dresser!  Frank deems Klinger a pervert, which provokes Klinger to shout, 'Pervert?  Who bit who major?'  I think he has a pretty good point! \n"}, {"text": "Still smitten but Nurse Johnson, Hawkeye pays a visit to her tent to give her a 'check-up'.  He is soon turned off however by the discovery that she is married.  What tips him off?", "correct": "Ring on her wedding finger", "options": ["Picture of her and her husband", "A reference she makes to her significant other", "A call from her husband"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRing on her wedding finger.\n\n\tHawkeye, armed with a full bottle of 'wine' (actually gin from the still and red food coloring...it always seemed impossible for the M*A*S*H doctors to get wine, but Charles got it so easily), makes his way into Nurse Johnson's tent to see how she is recovering from her injury, but with ulterior motives.  He soon notices the ring on her finger, however, and quickly makes his escape...much to her bewilderment. \n"}, {"text": "Is Nurse Johnson actually married?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNo, the ring was given to her by her grandmother and she simply wears it on the ring finger on her left hand to cut down on 'wrestling matches', as she says.  When Hawkeye discovers this he starts talking marriage!  How un-Hawkeye like... \n"}, {"text": "Following Hawkeye's sad discovery, we see Henry Blake in his office with Radar.  Soon enough, Frank and Hot Lips enter with their daily complaint...this time that Klinger is a pervert that is bucking for a Section 8, and they want to help him get it.  Henry is forced to summon Dr. Freedman to the M*A*S*H to help determine if Klinger is truly unfit to be in the army.  This episode is the first appearance of Dr. Freedman, who we know as 'Sydney'.  However, in this episode Radar refers to him by which first name?", "correct": "Milton", "options": ["Phil", "Roger", "James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilton.\n\n\tMajor Sidney Freedman, played by Alan Arbus, makes his first of many appearances in the series in 'Radar's Report'.  He's pretty rough on Klinger, insisting that Klinger is in fact a transvestite and a homosexual, something that will go on his permanent record.  I think Dr. Freedman is simply scaring Klinger 'straight', so to speak, and it works, Klinger storms out of the office.  The name confusion is interesting, as there is a famous economist named Milton Freedman...coincidence?  I doubt it... \n"}, {"text": "One of the M*A*S*H doctors loses a patient in this episode, which one?", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Henry", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tSurprisingly it was not Frank!  Trapper believes that the Chinese patient was at fault...the violent scene in the operating room costing his patient valuable minutes.  When Trapper is forced to go back in to do follow up surgery, his patient dies before he gets to the table. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper is so upset by the death of the American soldier that he approaches the Chinese soldier's bed and appears to 'threaten' the young man.  To what item does Trapper make a reference once he has approached the bed?  ", "correct": "IV", "options": ["Blood", "Pain killers", "Head bandages"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIV.\n\n\tIn a rather disturbing scene, Trapper approaches the Chinese soldier's IV supply and says, 'So you're doing okay huh?  Getting all that 'juice' you need?'  Hawkeye enters the room and says, 'Trapper...that's not what we're about.'  Can you imagine good old Trapper threatening anyone's IV supply?  I can't...but who knows what people will do in times of dispair and suffering? \n"}, {"text": "At the end of 'Radar's Report', Radar brings in his weekly report for Henry to sign.  Included are all the wacky events of the episode, including Klinger's episode with Dr. Freedman.  This elicits a recollection on Henry's part about Klinger's attire during breakfast that morning, of which Henry seemed oddly fond.  How does he describe Klinger's outfit?", "correct": "Tight little green satin job", "options": ["Snazzy red little number", "Little cute yellow jump suit", "Gorgeous blue bonanza"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTight little green satin job.\n\n\tHmm...Henry must really miss his wife at this point!
