{"id": "372961", "name": "Hardest \"Blood Bath\" Trivia Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Freak Show"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of Gloria's psychiatrist?", "correct": "Dr. Finebloom", "options": ["Dr. Arden", "Dr. Thredson", "Dr. Gruper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Finebloom\n\n\tGloria lays down on the divan at her psychiatrist's office and states that she fears losing Dandy; she refuses to abdicate responsibility of him despite what's been going on recently.  Dandy, she says, never seemed to understand the word 'No'; he always took it as an affront and, in the end, it always resulted in something bad happening.  Gloria recalls a young boy, the son of the gardener, who went missing without a trace.  Dr. Finebloom tells Gloria that it may be time to bring Dandy in for psychoanalysis and she doesn't let on that she knows exactly what her son has been doing. \n"}, {"text": "The freaks, finding Ma Petite's dress, assume that she died by which means?", "correct": "A coyote nabbed her in the night", "options": ["She drowned", "She was killed by someone from town", "Exposure to the elements did her in"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA coyote nabbed her in the night.\n\n\tThe freaks head out into the woods to search for Ma Petite en masse and Dell lies the entire way.  A dog eventually finds Ma Petite's dress and Jimmy is the one who has to bring it back to Elsa in the big tent.  They assume a coyote found her first.  While Elsa weeps over the loss, Ethel watches angrily.\rThat evening, Ethel brings Elsa her dinner and says that she thought she would be high by that point, wearing away the emotions.  Elsa, however, believed Ma Petite was too good for the life of a freak.  When Elsa turns around she finds that Ethel is clearly drunk.  It doesn't take long for Ethel to reveal her true intent. \n"}, {"text": "Ethel shoots Elsa, but where?", "correct": "In the leg", "options": ["In the arm", "In the head", "In the stomach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the leg.\n\n\tEthel compliments Elsa on her acting abilities saying that her performance in the big tent, when Ma Petite's dress was found, was second-to-none.  Elsa, of course, is insulted by the comment and slaps the woman she claimed to be a 'sister' earlier.  The two of them argue before Ethel claims that Elsa was never motherly as she let on.  She also says that she heard Elsa and Stanley's plan to kill the twins; Elsa, of course, denies that she ever intended to do so and says that she'll bring the twins in to proclaim her innocence. It's too late though-- Ethel already hid the girls somewhere Elsa doesn't know. As Elsa tries to leave, Ethel pulls out a gun and fires it...right through Elsa's wooden leg. \n"}, {"text": "To save her own life, Elsa has to shoot Ethel with her own gun.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tElsa tells Ethel what happened after she lost her legs. As it turns out, the soldier who was her greatest client took her to Massimo Dolcefino, a carpenter with a knack for prosthetics.  He cleaned Elsa up and promised one of his greatest works: a new pair of beautiful legs to fix her.  Ethel is shocked that Elsa would keep it a secret for so long and she keeps the gun fixed on her, promising that after she kills her, she'll kill herself instead of face justice. In fact, she's already left a suicide note for Jimmy.  Elsa, realizing her time is short, suggests one last schnapps for the road, for both of them, and Ethel allows it.  This is her fatal move. While Elsa prepares the drinks, she grabs one of her bullseye knives off the table and hurls it, hitting Ethel in the eye and killing her instantly. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Ethel's body found?", "correct": "In a car", "options": ["In a field", "In her caravan", "In town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a car.\n\n\tThe next day, Maggie's the one to find Ethel's body, but under very odd circumstances.  While out picking flowers for Ma Petite's memorial, Maggie heard a car crash and found Ethel's body behind the wheel.  The freaks, investigating, find that her head was torn clean from her body as a result of (what must've been) an elaborate suicide plan; she tied a chain around her tree, then around her neck, and drove. Elsa puts on quite a spectacle mourning her departed friend when, really, she and Stanley had to cover up the murder.  Everyone else believes it was suicide because, after all, she was quite ill. Jimmy's the one to comfort Elsa. \n"}, {"text": "Gloria, covering for her son, tells Regina that her mother went out to purchase which of these?", "correct": "Squash", "options": ["Fur coats", "Azalea bulbs", "Cornish game hens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquash.\n\n\tGloria returns home with a surprise for Dandy only to find that an unexpected guest has arrived at the Mott Estate: Regina Ross, looking for her mother.  Gloria is forced to make up an elaborate excuse to cover up the murder, but Regina is willing to wait it out.\rThat night, the freaks gather around Ethel's burial site and Jimmy gives the eulogy.  As they lower the coffin into its grave, Dell urges the others to get a drink to forget their sorrows.  Desiree, Eve, Suzi, and Penny stay back and vow vengeance against the men who've wronged them.  Their first target: Penny's father. \n"}, {"text": "Gloria, in an attempt to get Dandy to go to her psychiatrist, says that he needs to be tested for which of these?", "correct": "His Genius IQ", "options": ["Schizophrenia", "Iron deficiencies", "Depression"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis Genius IQ.\n\n\tDandy ends up seeing Dr. Finebloom and the results are shocking, at least to him, mainly because Dandy responds to each Rorschach test with a grisly image.  When it becomes clear that the Doctor wants him to come back for sessions twice a week (instead of simply measure his Genius IQ), Dandy refuses to go back and chastises his mother. Regina, meanwhile, is still at the house looking for answers.  She states that if she doesn't see her mother by dinner the next day, she'll go to the police.  When she leaves, Dandy strikes up a bargain: if Gloria kills Regina, he'll go back to the doctor for a month. \n"}, {"text": "What is Ima Wiggles' original name?", "correct": "Barbara", "options": ["Beverly", "Betty", "Beatrice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbara.\n\n\tElsa goes out to a rehabilitation clinic in Miami to find her newest acquisition, Barbara, a severely-overweight girl from Park Avenue who's forced to attend living at the clinic until she loses weight.  It doesn't take much to convince her to join the show.\rThe girls at the camp, meanwhile, gather their things and leave the stove on low.  They head directly to Penny's old house, sneak in through the window, and ambush her father while he's getting ready for bed.\rJimmy, back in the big tent, imbibes more than he ever has while he mourns.  Elsa tries to knock sense into him as she prepares a feast for Barbara, now known as Ima Wiggles. \n"}, {"text": "Who stops the girls of the freak show from committing murder?", "correct": "Maggie", "options": ["Elsa", "Dell", "Jimmy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggie.\n\n\tPenny's father has the hood pulled off his head in time to find the girls making their final preparations.  Taking the pillows off Dell's bed and the tar off the burner on the oven, Penny's the one to do the honours, pouring the hot stuff over her father's head and body before the others cover him in feathers. Maggie's the one to hear the screams and arrives before Desiree can do any further damage.  Fortunately, she's able to stop them all, telling them that the chances they have to live better lives would be gone if they killed him.  Penny allows him to go free, but Desi tells eve to leave him at the side of camp and force him to crawl home. \n"}, {"text": "Does Gloria end up killing Regina to protect her son?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tJimmy, still not sober, brushes off Maggie in anger when she tries to get him to leave the freak show once and for all.  Seeking comfort, he finds himself in the arms of Ima Wiggles.\rBack at the Mott estate, Gloria speaks to Dr. Finebloom to cancel her sessions, stating that she's already booked a cruise away from the state and that all will be fine.  Dandy blames his mother for everything that's wrong as he was born from sin and she says that they can still have a chance to get away from it all.  Unfortunately, she has no more love to give.  Dandy, brandishing a golden gun, turns it on himself in despair, but Gloria claims that he can't commit suicide or she wouldn't be able to go on.  Instead, he shoots her in the head.  That night, he drains her body of blood and bathes in it. \n"}]}
