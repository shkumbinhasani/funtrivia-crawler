The one my Dad just opened is able to liquefy all the foods he needs and puree as well (pureeing occurs when vegetables or fruits are blended into a thick liquid).

One popular idea is to put ice inside, crush it down to a consistency, add fruit and milk, and make a cold smoothie.  Food processors typically do the same thing with larger vegetables and the like, but they're normally used for more menial tasks such as chopping or slicing. \n"}, {"text": "What in the world did I wrap for my Grandma?\nYou know that she'll be happy with her patterned, new pajamas.\nI thought about a children's show, I guess I took the plunge,\nBut what shape are the pants of that incessant, yellow sponge?", "correct": "Square", "options": ["Circle", "Rectangle", "Cube"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSquare.\n\n\tGrandma seems to like the Nickelodeon TV show \"Spongebob Squarepants\".
