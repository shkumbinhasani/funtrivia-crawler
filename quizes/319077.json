Following this Malcolm explains that he always takes Jerry with him wherever he goes.  Being the good house guest he his, Malcolm offers Bill a taste of Jerry.  Luckily for Bill, Sookie picks up the thoughts of Jerry who is pleased to be infecting another vampire with 'Hep D'.  Once the vampire trio learn this, Jerry's future prospects look poor. Bill explains that Hepatitis D is the only blood-borne pathogen to which vampires are susceptible, it is apparently a mutation which is harmless to humans.  Hepatitis D will not kill a vampire, though it will make them weak and hence vulnerable for around a month.In the books, this disease is called Sino-Aids. \n"}, {"text": "The new vampires in town - Malcolm, Diane and Liam - have lived together for some time.

He believes that \"vampires living alone are much more likely to hang onto a semblance of humanity\".   When Bill later visits the trio's nest Liam introduces him as \"everyone's favourite buzz-kill\".  It becomes apparent that the three aren't interested in towing the vampire party line, telling Bill that not everyone wants to play human and live off synthetic blood. As Malcolm states, \"if we can't kill people what's the point of being a vampire?\".  Malcolm also reveals that they left the Hepatitis D infected Jerry's body by the road - well most of it anyway. \n"}, {"text": "After opening Bill's front door to find Sookie, the vampire Malcolm attempts to \"glamour\" her.

The vampires are nonplussed, but allow Sookie to enter unharmed after Bill orders them to let her inside.  Sookie retains her Southern manners during the altercation, the same cannot be said for the three vampires. \n"}, {"text": "Jason continues to have difficulty in sustaining relationships.
