The original version by The Doors hit #1 on the Billboard 'Hot 100' in 1968 and appeared on their \"Waiting for the Sun\" album.\rIn the episode, Will instructs the kids to find a new way to say 'hello' through song and with some convincing he persuades Finn to sing this hit through the halls of the school.  At the time, Finn is dealing with his love issues.  While he's dating Rachel, he wants to tell the truth to Quinn. \n"}, {"text": "To express her anger, Rachel sings what All-American Rejects song in \"Hell-O\"?", "correct": "Gives You Hell", "options": ["Hells Bells", "Highway to Hell", "Hello Again"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGives You Hell.\n\n\tFinn is unable to deal with being in a relationship with Rachel and decides to break it off.

Mr. Schuester is clearly displeased with this obvious display towards Finn and Rachel simply replies she focused on the first syllable of the week's assignment.\r\"Gives You Hell\" was originally released on the All-American Rejects' third album, \"When the World Comes Down\", as its first single (hitting #1 on two US Billboard charts).  The \"Glee\" version, released as a single from \"Glee: The Music - Vol. 3 (Showstoppers)\", hit #1 in Ireland and #32 on the Billboard charts, the highest-ranking song in the \"Glee\" setlist since \"Defying Gravity\" in the show's ninth episode (\"Wheels\"). \n"}, {"text": "In \"Hell-O\", Jesse and Rachel sing a Lionel Richie duet on a piano.

The two sing Lionel Richie's \"Hello\" which hit #1 in the US and UK (via Billboard and the UK Singles Chart) in 1984 and she falls for him.\r\"Hello\" was, in fact, released as a single from \"Glee: The Music - Vol. 3 (Showstoppers)\" where it reached a peak of #35 on the Billbaort charts. \n"}, {"text": "The entire Glee Club sings the closing song for \"Hell-O\", \"Hello Goodbye\".", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFinn is unable to get Rachel back, Rachel is holding in a secret from the rest of the club, and Will is forced to put his relationship with Emma on hold as the episode ends and the kids finally find the right way for them all to to say 'hello'.

Unfortunately, the makeover doesn't stick.\r\"Vogue\" did not chart after its release on \"Glee: The Power of Madonna\", but Madonna's rendition was fairly important in her career- especially its music video.
