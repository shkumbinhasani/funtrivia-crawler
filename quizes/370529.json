Average [A]"], "questions": [{"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Past urges you to take a trip back in time with him to discover what has really transpired on December 25th.  Which of these events occurred on the festive holiday?", "correct": "Hirohito became Emperor of Japan in 1926", "options": ["Cirque du Soleil debuted in 1984", "The Berlin Wall fell in 1989", "The first annual Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHirohito became Emperor of Japan in 1926.\n\n\tHirohito, who commenced his sixty-plus year reign over Japan in 1926, was known for being the man in power during the Second World War (and well beyond it).  Hirohito's son, Akihito, became Emperor upon his father's death in 1989.\r The Berlin Wall actually fell in late 1989, well before Christmas in Germany.  Cirque du Soleil, meanwhile, commenced in June 1984 in Quebec, Canada.  The first-ever Oscars Ceremony was held in May 1929 in Los Angeles, California. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Even Further Past is lesser-known, but much more insistent than his other historical brother.  To get you into the Christmas spirit, he brings you back to early Christmas trees.  What British Queen is often credited with the popularization of the traditional tree in the UK?", "correct": "Queen Victoria", "options": ["Queen Mary II", "Queen Elizabeth I", "Queen Anne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Victoria.\n\n\tWhile 'Christmas Trees' have been around since before the extensive reign of Queen Victoria in the nineteenth century, many credit the monarch with its widespread popularity, at least in Britain and influenced colonies.  Early artistic renderings of Christmas trees in the royal palace featured ornaments such as lit candles (you know, for safety), food, and other trinkets while more modern versions usually feature electric lights and glass/plastic ornaments.  It became a tradition across the UK (and beyond), but it actually started much earlier in other European countries. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Presents is not to be confused with his contemporary brother, mainly because his concern lies with celebratory gifting.  It's known that the Three Wise Men, as per the story, gave gifts to Baby Jesus.  How many of those gifts were plant-based?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "None of them", "All three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tWhile gold would be the obvious non-plant material of the bunch, frankincense and myrrh are both plant-based resins, the former being used in perfumes and for therapeutic purposes and the latter being used as incense.  Both frankincense and myrrh clearly have distinct smells; one would hope that the Baby Jesus didn't have allergies.\rThe story of the Three Wise Men is notable, especially around the Christmas season, as it tells of an instance of giving.  The Biblical Magi cross the desert following the brightest start to deliver presents to the child in nativity.  Nowadays, they'd probably order it online (and hey, they'd save on shipping). \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Carols invites you to forget your troubles with a rousing chorus of 'Fa la la la las'.  Which of these typical carols includes the line \"Fa la la la la la la la la\"?", "correct": "Deck the Halls", "options": ["Jingle Bells", "The First Noel", "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeck the Halls.\n\n\tOriginally written as a Welsh tune in the mid-nineteenth century, \"Deck the Halls\" was quickly rewritten in English, becoming one of the most beloved and (dare I say) repetitive Christmas carols of the holiday season.  The English version first appeared in 1862 and the lyrics have since changed time and time again; the common thread is a joyous bout of 'Fa la laing' after nearly every line.  \"Jingle Bells\" predates it by about five years in creation. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Bullet is certainly an interesting one, mainly because of its lack of a tenuous link to the holidays.  Perhaps the real blessing is that it no longer exists, mainly because it was a horribly flawed version of which of these?", "correct": "Airplane", "options": ["Weapon", "Television show", "Automatic juicer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAirplane.\n\n\tThe Christmas Bullet, only named as such after its creator, Dr. William Whitney Christmas, was considered flawed from the get-go, mainly because, as an airplane, it failed to have any sort of safety mechanisms and suffered from apparent design flaws.  During its first flight, the wings tore off the fuselage (which happens when you intentionally leave out the struts and make them with warpable material) and the plane was destroyed.  Count your blessings this Christmas, even if only for the thought that engineering has come a long way since 1919. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Spirits is a jovial spectre who, as it seems, is more concerned with remembering the joyous season with some light-hearted imbibing.  Is it true that you would normally find egg in egg nog?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tSure enough, the name 'egg nog' does refer to the fact that it contains egg.  You wouldn't find a yolk floating in it, but yolk is beaten to thicken the drink.  Egg nog can often be bought in grocery stores around the holidays, usually non-alcoholic, but it's a drink that often suits rum or brandy and can be bought in an alcoholic version as well.  Egg nog is more popular in North America than anywhere else.\r What's a nog, you ask?  Well...not a drink.  The word likely refers to the container the drink would originally be served in. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Specials invites you to spend time in front of the television this holiday season; you can always drown out the sound of the holidays with the sound of misfit toys dancing onscreen.  The Island of Misfit Toys appeared in what holiday TV special first airing in 1964?", "correct": "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", "options": ["Frosty the Snowman", "A Charlie Brown Christmas", "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n\n\tWhile there's certainly a cavalcade of different 'traditional' specials that parade their way onto TV screens beginning as early as November, most people will turn towards \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" as their favourite, mainly because of its timeless quality.  The special, originally airing on NBC, is a family favourite and has since been made into a stage production. Following Rudolph and an elf who actually wants to be a dentist, the special follows two misfits as they set out as friends to find their place in the world.  Inevitably they end up at an Island of Misfit Toys, meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, and encounter a Yeti, all before Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh on Christmas Eve night. The special was narrated by Burl Ives. \n"}, {"text": "You're probably worried about going out for the day, but the Ghost of Christmas Shopping is out and about to make you feel better.  It would probably be wiser for this ghost to appear on what 'Black' day of the week, usually in late November, and known for shopping?", "correct": "Friday", "options": ["Tuesday", "Christmas", "Sunday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday.\n\n\tBlack Friday refers to the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving, on whatever date that may fall in any given year, and most often indicates a day of massive sales and markdowns in retail outlets to start off the Christmas season, especially when regarding electronics.  The term and practice first emerged in the United States but, due to its overwhelming popularity and the U.S.' global influence on shopping, it's spread internationally and online. Oddly, the date has also taken on a bad reputation for being dangerous; dozens have been injured and some have died (mostly in the U.S.) trying to take advantage of deals and once-a-year low price points. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Not Christmas At All would be quick to remind you that there's always something going on, even if you still decide to resist that specific holiday.  Which of these holidays doesn't occur in December?", "correct": "Chinese New Year", "options": ["New Year's Eve", "Kwanzaa", "Hannukah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChinese New Year.\n\n\tWhile Kwanzaa and New Year's Eve occur on the same day(s) every year (with Kwanzaa occurring from December 26th to the 1st of January and New Year's Eve falling on December 31st), both Hannukah and Chinese New Year shift to accommodate non-Gregorian calendars.  Hannukah, for instance, varies based on the Jewish calendar and can fall anywhere between late November and early January over the span of eight nights.  Chinese New Year, while it shifts, occurs in January or February, and not December like the others. \n"}, {"text": "The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is depicted as which of the following in Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\"?", "correct": "A hooded phantom", "options": ["A homeless beggar", "A lavish hedonist", "A young, crippled boy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA hooded phantom.\n\n\tAppearing in Stave Four of Dickens' 1843 Christmas ghost story, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is the fourth who appears to the original humbug and old coot, Ebenezer Scrooge, and who ultimately forces him to look towards his own mortality.  A grim spectre who seems to personify death, this ghost wears a black cloak and brings Scrooge to his own grave before the night comes to an end.  Scrooge is also visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Jacob Marley.\r One year I asked for a ghost and I didn't even get one-- he should be considering himself fortunate! \n"}]}
