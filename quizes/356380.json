{"id": "356380", "name": "\"Spilt Milk\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Asylum"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the woman who is paid to spend the night with the modern day Bloody Face?", "correct": "Pandora", "options": ["Juliet", "Lana", "Hestia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPandora.\n\n\tSitting in Dr. Oliver Thredson's old house, Johnny smokes before answering a knock at the door; his guest has arrived.  When he opens it, it's Pandora, a woman he hired to spend the night.  Pandora had a baby three weeks earlier.  When Johnny pays her, she understands what he wants; she's been saving up all day. Sitting on the couch with her, Johnny asks about what happens if she hears her baby crying.  She says she finds herself unable to contain herself and needs to breastfeed her child.  She'll take care of him, and mother him, but he doesn't need to cry to be her baby.  He says he'd kill for it. \n"}, {"text": "After whom does Grace want to name her baby?", "correct": "Her grandfather", "options": ["Monsignor Howard", "Kit's father", "Her horse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer grandfather.\n\n\tKit's cell in solitary opens and Dr. Thredson appears in the doorway to retrieve him.  It's time to visit with his and Grace's baby boy.  Thredson says that if there's anything he can hold dear it's a child's reception of love and affection.  When Kit heads to the common room, Pepper is fending off the other inmates while Grace coddles the baby close to her chest. Kit heads near and Grace tells him that she wants to name the baby Thomas after her grandfather; he agrees.  When Pepper calls out Dr. Thredson on his evil scheming, Thredson sends her off to hydrotherapy and takes the other inmates to a group therapy session elsewhere to give the new parents time to talk. \n"}, {"text": "Does Grace agree to marry Kit?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tHolding onto the baby, Kit finds that he has no choice but to ask about her abduction.  Grace says that the pieces of her memory don't fit together.  She remembers getting shot in the kitchen and praying for death.  She saw a bright, white light but it wasn't heaven; she felt like she was being torn in half and she never thought she could survive it.  He was born in a short time on Earth, perhaps, but time works differently there.  Grace also saw Alma, floating below her in an endless pool of water.  She was dead.  Grace says that Kit is special, and so is their baby, and that they'll change the way people think.  Kit asks Grace to marry him and she says yes.\rMoments after, they're interrupted by the Monsignor and a Sister from an orphanage.  They've come for the baby.  They take the child from Kit's arms and Thredson walks in.  He poses the option that perhaps he can help. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Lana hide Thredson's confession tape?", "correct": "In the kitchen", "options": ["In the hydrotherapy room", "In her cell", "In the death chute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the kitchen.\n\n\tLana is met by Mother Claudia, Jude's Mother Superior, in the kitchen of Briarcliff.  Claudia tells Lana that Jude has told her everything and they can start to make things right by getting her out of this horrible place.  Claudia hands over her patient file; it's irrefutable proof that she spent as long as she did in the asylum. Her clothes and personal effects are in the lavatory next door.  Mother Superior wishes her luck; she also suggests that Lana get this place torn to the ground and the earth salted.  Before making her escape, Lana opens a nearby drawer and tears into a bag of flour to reveal the confession tape she and Kit recorded. It goes with her, she says. \n"}, {"text": "How does Lana escape Briarcliff?", "correct": "In a taxi cab", "options": ["In a school bus", "In a delivery van", "On foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a taxi cab.\n\n\tOn Lana's way out of the kitchen, she approaches an unnoticing Jude sitting at a table kneading dough.  She vows that she will come back for her.\rIn the main lobby of the asylum, Thredson tells Kit that he can get his son out of the orphanage and do everything in his power to get him out of Briarcliff to protect him provided he retrieves the confession tape that Lana hid.  With the tape in their possession, they can blame the now-missing Dr. Arden for the Bloodyface murders.  Although Thredson's back is turned, Kit notices Lana walking down the stairs behind him, and straight out the front door to her waiting cab.  She gets in and Thredson rushes outside.  He realizes that she's slipped away as Mother Claudia heads inside.  From the cab, Lana places the tape against the window, gives Thredson the middle finger, and drives off to her freedom. \n"}, {"text": "What is Dr. Thredson's final drink?", "correct": "Martini", "options": ["Red wine", "Bloody Mary", "Gin and tonic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMartini.\n\n\tThredson rushes home and immediately finds Lana waiting for him, gun poised, sitting in the corner of his room.  The police, she says, already have the tape and they're on their way.  It's done.  Thredson says that he's actually relieved and that living with secrets isn't healthy.  Thredson makes himself his last martini while Lana keeps the gun pointed at him.  Little does she know, he has a gun in the bar drawer.\r In the present time, Johnny Thredson spends his night with Pandora, consuming her breast milk.  She says that he definitely has some mommy issues and he agrees-- he's fixated.\r Thredson takes a seat in front of the fireplace and tells her all about Wendy-- he left her intact to sleep with her body, practicing for Lana.  After Lana escaped, he had to dispose of the body all around the state.\r Johnny cries over his lost parents and blames Lana for making him want to do bad things.  He takes Pandora by the throat and squeezes.\r As the sirens are heard outside, Thredson stands up to make a refill.  He asks Lana if she'll keep the baby.  She says no.  He decides that perhaps there's no longer a reason to keep her.  Before he reaches for the gun, she takes a shot, killing him instantly.  Prison, she says, is too good for him. \n"}, {"text": "Who or what does Lana blame for Wendy's death?", "correct": "\"The story\"", "options": ["\"The Bloodyfaced killer\"", "Herself", "\"The asylum\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The story\".\n\n\tLana and her friends stand in front of Wendy's placard in a mausoleum.  She tells them that she has a couple of things to finish-- she's deciding to move to New York.  The girls blame the nun, Sister Jude, but Lana blames the story; she was going to do anything to get the story and it cost her.  The girls remind Lana to call the doctor they recommended before the paparazzi arrive.  As Lana heads to the car waiting for her and drives away, she rolls down the window and recommends that if they want answers, they read her book.\rAt Briarcliff, Jude has problems getting her mind to work.  She tells the others not to take their pills-- the tranquilizers will turn their brains to mush.  Reading over newspapers, the Monsignor discovers that the word is out regarding Briarcliff.  The reporters are still outside and, at the same time, he has to deal with Jude. \n"}, {"text": "Lana's decision to turn in the tape has a ripple effect.  Who's released from Briarcliff as a direct result of her action?", "correct": "Kit", "options": ["Pepper", "Jude", "Shelley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKit.\n\n\tThe Monsignor speaks to Jude in person after shutting off the jukebox and she asks him if he's recognized the irony; the Monsignor lost his purity to the Devil.  She asks if he's renounced his vows, but he hasn't.  He says that he has too much to offer.  She says that she would've done anything to follow him to Rome.  Now, she only feels only disgust towards him.  After all of this, he's stripped her down to nothing and thrown her into the asylum; she's more sane now than ever, with more clarity than ever.  He sends Jude to solitary.\rAt the same time, Kit is removed from solitary to speak to the Monsignor.  He's being released since Lana turned in the tape and killed Bloodyface.  Now, investigators are looking into the corruption at Briarcliff. \n"}, {"text": "When Kit returns home, he finds Alma waiting for him.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tKit talks to the Monsignor about a matter of great importance: his son and new wife.  Although 'justice' has been served, he wants his son back from the orphanage.  He also wants Grace freed.  The Monsignor says she's confined, but Kit tells him that Arden signed Grace's death certificate (a fact he learned from Thredson).  In return, he won't tell anyone about the horrors at Briarcliff.  Monsignor Howard decides to take this offer as it sweeps his problems under the rug.\rPulling up to Kit's old house in a cab, he, Thomas, and Grace walk up to the door; he tells Grace that they can get a horse if she takes care of it.  They walk inside to find the mess still there from the night of his and Alma's abduction.  They also find, to their shock, Alma sitting in the bedroom with a baby girl in her arms. \n"}, {"text": "According to the Monsignor, how did Jude die?", "correct": "She hanged herself", "options": ["She was killed by another patient", "She jumped from the stairwell", "She choked on her pills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe hanged herself.\n\n\tLana knows that she doesn't want to have her baby under these circumstances and heads to the 'doctor' she was recommended to.  Although they almost commence the abortion, Lana backs out at the last minute, unable to cope with spilling any more blood.\rOver the next few months, she speaks to investigators and leads the charge against Briarcliff.  To validate her claims, she decides that she needs to free Jude from the asylum and, obtaining a warrant, she and the police descend upon the Monsignor in his office.  The Monsignor is sorry to say, however, that Sister Jude is dead.  Jude, he says, hanged herself in her cell with a bedsheet.  She was also cremated since she died outside a state of grace.  Lana departs.\r Jude, now in a smaller solitary cell, recites prayers in isolation.\r In a hospital, a nurse brings Lana her baby despite her wishes.  As it cries for milk, Lana gives in.  She lets her baby feed, but only once.  As she stares up to the sky, she sees the cross hanging on the wall above her bed. \n"}]}
