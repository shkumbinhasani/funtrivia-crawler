{"id": "229201", "name": "Stay Alive Trivia Quiz | Stay Alive | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Stay Alive"], "questions": [{"text": "How did Hutch's mother pass away?", "correct": "She was in a fire", "options": ["The Blood Countess killed her", "She drowned", "She was shot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe was in a fire.\n\n\tThroughout the movie, Hutch has to deal with his emotional past, involving his father setting fire to his house while he and his mother were inside.  Luckily, he was saved by a firefighter, but his mother wasn't so lucky.  In order to defeat Elizabeth Bathory, the Blood Countess, one has to stab her with three nails, then set fire to her body. \n"}, {"text": "Who is Hutch's boss?", "correct": "Miller", "options": ["Loomis", "Rex", "Ronan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiller.\n\n\tLoomis is actually Hutch's friend (who is almost like a brother to him) whom he lived with after the fire.  Loomis is a video game tester, and he is the Blood Countess' first victim of the movie.  In the game \"Stay Alive\", he walks into a room to find two people massacred, and the Blood Countess manages to hang him from a balcony.  The same thing manages to happen to Loomis and his roommate after he loses the game. \n"}, {"text": "What type of plant will protect players from the Blood Countess?", "correct": "Roses", "options": ["Lilacs", "Chrysanthemums", "Ivy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoses.\n\n\tThe players begin the game by reciting a poem from a diary and they choose their characters.  They are also told that the game is based on the life of Elizabeth Bathory, who massacred many young girls in order to preserve her own youth, and was known as the Blood Countess.  In the beginning, they find their first enemy and defeat it to find a rose.  They are then told that this rose will temporarily protect them from enemies and evil; even from the Blood Countess. \n"}, {"text": "How does Hutch's boss get killed?", "correct": "He's stabbed with shears", "options": ["He's set on fire", "He's hanged", "He's run over by a horse-drawn carriage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's stabbed with shears.\n\n\tWhile playing the game as a group, Hutch, Swink, Miller, Phineus, Abigail, and October make their way through a graveyard infested with crazy, evil child zombies.  Miller decides to split off from the group in order to protect himself and he finds a secret passage to a torture chamber.  He manages to run out of roses at the wrong moment and the Blood Countess gets him.  The gang calls it a night and Miller (via an Internet link) tells the group that he's done.  As he's leaving the office, the Blood Countess kills him in the same way she did in the game. \n"}, {"text": "What material can give a reflection of the Blood Countess?", "correct": "Silver", "options": ["Gold", "Glass", "Aluminum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilver.\n\n\tPhineus decides to play the game on his own for a while when the others are too shaken up about Miller's death, and he finds a horse-drawn carriage in the courtyard in front of the house in the game.  Clearly, the one inside the carriage is the Blood Countess.  He tries to look at it with a mirror but it cracks. This is because the Blood Countess doesn't want to look at herself as an old woman (she is obsessed with preserving her youth).  Luckily, Phin is able to look at her reflection on the silver backing of his mirror.  He pauses the game before his fate can be discovered, but he never returns because he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Phineus' sister?", "correct": "October", "options": ["April", "June", "February"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOctober.\n\n\tOctober is the dark, goth girl of the movie, and she's the one who manages to research most of the information about Elizabeth Bathory.  When Phineus is found dead, she is outraged since she has no-one else in the world.\rMeanwhile at the spot where Phin was killed, Hutch tries to explain the 'you die in the game, you die for real' theory, but the cops find it far-fetched.  One even decides to play the game himself.  He doesn't get very far before Hutch stops him.  The cop goes to a video game store to find if \"Stay Alive\" is a real game, but it isn't.  When he gets into his car, he's killed by the Blood Countess as well.  The police decide to go after the others since they're connected to all of the murders. \n"}, {"text": "What does Phin's sister try to use to defeat the Blood Countess?", "correct": "A nail gun", "options": ["A hammer", "A match", "A lighter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA nail gun.\n\n\tThe cops go to Hutch's house, so they flee to Loomis' house to search for clues.  While doing this, they find October's character in the game and realize that she's walking through the neighbourhood.  October spots The Blood Countess in a renovated house and decides to get revenge on her for killing her brother.  She loads a nail gun and attempts to shoot her, but The Blood Countess is just a ghost.  The others arrive too late and find October nearly dead. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays the game while the others investigate Bathory's plantation?", "correct": "Swink", "options": ["Hutch", "Miller", "Abigail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwink.\n\n\tSwink searches the internet and finds the company that made the game.  When they arrive, they realize that it's identical to the plantation in the game (complete with a graveyard, torture chamber, and tower).  Swink decides to play the game while the others search for answers in order to make sure that they aren't ambushed or killed themselves.  While Abigail searches the house, she finds the hidden attic and Bathory's diary (containing that poem from the game), but she is cornered by the Blood Countess.  Swink calls Hutch on his cell phone and manages to help him (by dropping items in the game and having them appear in real life), and Abigail is saved.\rSuddenly, the doors of the van slam shut and Swink is cut off from the game.  He breaks a window just in time to save his character from being run over by the horse-drawn carriage, but he's chased down the road by the real thing.  He lands in a bush and the Blood Countess steps out of the carriage. \n"}, {"text": "Is the torture chamber found in the basement of the house?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter losing contact with Swink and finding his character dead in the game, Hutch and Abigail rush to the graveyard and make their way to the tower.  They end up in the same place that Miller did containing the torture chamber.  Suddenly, they're followed by zombie girls (victims of Bathory's massacres), but Abigail thinks quickly and uses some spare roses to get rid of them temporarily.  When they arrive at the torture chamber, Hutch begins to head to the tower, but Abigail is locked out of it.  He leaves her with a rose for protection while he finishes the job. \n"}, {"text": "How many nails must be hammered into Bathory's body to return her soul to the body?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Five", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tOne nail must go in the head, the second must go into the heart, and the third must go elsewhere in order to pin her soul to her body.  Before Hutch finishes this, Abigail plays an innocent game of 'He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not' and irresponsibly uses her remaining rose.  The Blood Countess takes notice of this and chains her up while threatening her with shears.  Hutch finishes his deed and Abigail is left hanging, but the Blood Countess ends up waking up.  Hutch takes his laptop out of his bag and points its reflective surface at Bathory's face to make her angry (remember, the glass would have broken, the case was silver).  He then sets her on fire to burn her blood.  Unfortunately, the tower door is locked, and he's stuck in the tower with her, forced to face his past.  At that moment, Swink bursts the door open carrying a rose bush (the one he landed on while being chased by the Blood Countess), and he, Hutch and Abigail escape with their lives, having beaten the game.\r In the end, the \"Stay Alive\" video game is now arriving in stores, and people all over the world have begun playing it. \n"}]}
