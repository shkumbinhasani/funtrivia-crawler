Something is in the pool with her though, and she needs to scramble to climb the ladder.  The surface isn't much different though; Steve's house is covered in the same matter.  She doesn't make it.  Whatever's in the pool pulls her back in.  No one in the house hears her screams.\rLater that night, Nancy wakes up and decides to depart.  She gets back home only to be caught by her mother who, believing she would be home at 10, waited up.  Her mother insists she can talk to her, but Nancy insists nothing happened. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce is convinced that Will is trying to speak to her via which of these?", "correct": "The lamp", "options": ["Her mind", "The television", "The fan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe lamp.\n\n\tThe next morning, Jonathan wakes up to hear his mother crying in Will's room.  He finds her speaking to the lights and she insists that he's in the lamp, trying to speak to her.  The lamp does flicker when she speaks to it, but Jonathan isn't convinced.  He thinks she's losing grip and needs sleep.\rThe boys, meanwhile, plan to enact Operation Mirkwood, gathering weapons and foods that they'll need to sustain themselves to hunt for will and defeat whatever monster may be searching for him.

Nancy's worried that everyone knows what they did, but Steve insists he hasn't told anyone; she's just paranoid.  When Nancy gets to class, Barb doesn't show up.\rHopper brings his cops to the restricted Department of Energy labs and tries to talk his way in through the gates simply to check the location off his list of to-dos.\rEleven, meanwhile, uses her telekinetic powers to lift items in Mike's basement.  With no one home, she ends up heading into the rest of the house, playing around with the electronics and recalling her horrific treatment in the lab. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce decides to buy which of these from work to test out a theory?", "correct": "Christmas lights", "options": ["Telephones", "Glow sticks", "Playing cards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristmas lights.\n\n\tJoyce roots through old boxes to find the family's Christmas lights and, using nails, she decides to hang them up along all of the walls.  When she runs out, she decides she has no choice but to go back to work and clear out their entire stock of light strands.\rAt the labs, Hopper is shown the other end of the storm drain and is assured that no one would be able to head in or out considering the surveillance cameras and the size of the drain.  He asks to see the camera footage and is brought into the building to see the tapes.  Watching these, it's apparent there's nothing on them.  Hopper is certain they're lying; it was raining on the night after Will went missing.  There's no rain on the tape.\rUnder the labs, the organic material in the basement continues to grow. \n"}, {"text": "When bullies knock Mike over at school, he inadvertently finds which of these?", "correct": "A rock for a slingshot", "options": ["A shoelace", "A body", "A living creature"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA rock for a slingshot.\n\n\tEleven ventures upstairs to find Nancy's room and, there, finds pictures of Nancy's normal life on her walls.\rAt school, Nancy asks if the others saw Barb head out when they left Steve's the previous night, but no one seems to know where she went.

When the bullies leave, they find the rock they need to fire from their slingshot.\rJonathan heads to the school darkroom to develop his photos; most of them are of Nancy.\rJoyce strings her lights up throughout the house as Karen, Mike's mom, shows up with a casserole.  They speak nothing of the lights. \n"}, {"text": "Who sees the walls move in the Byers household?", "correct": "Holly", "options": ["Hopper", "Karen", "Jonathan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolly.\n\n\tHopper heads to the library to rustle through some old newspapers on microfiche.  Dr. Brenner, who works at the labs, appears in some of the articles.\rJoyce and Karen discuss the issues at hand with Will missing and Karen says she understands what the Byers family s going through, even including the lights.  What they don't notice is Karen's youngest, Holly, following the blinking lights down the hallway into Will's room, where the lamps Joyce set up around the bed are flickering in sequence...until they go out.  Holly moves to the corner of the room to the wall Joyce saw moving.  Holly sees it too. \n"}, {"text": "Who breaks Jonathan's camera?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Joyce", "Barb", "Nancy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tNancy calls Barb's house and her mother says that she doesn't know where she is; she hasn't been home since the party.  Jonathan, meanwhile, is accosted by Steve and his friends over his photos.  The others tear apart the incriminating photos when Nancy arrives and break his camera on the pavement.  Nancy stays to grab a picture of Barb; neither know it was the last time she was around.\rEleven makes it to the power lines for 3:15 and the boys arrive, but not before Eleven is frightened by a cat.  As it turns out, animals don't seem to like her.  One day, during her testing, she was in an examination involving a cat.  She was dragged to her cell, screaming, and killed her guards before they could close the door.  Dr. Brenner was thrilled with the progress. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce is able to communicate with Will.  Does he claim that he's safe wherever he is?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe boys pick up Eleven and she hops on Mike's bike as they head into the forests.  She asks him who hurt him and the two share their mutual understanding of bullies as they trek onward.\rNancy, meanwhile, heads out to find Barb's car still on the side of the road, three blocks from Steve's place.  She returns to Steve's to find a certain stillness; no one is home.  Walking into the woods she hears rustling; something's out there.  She's scared enough to flee back to the road.\rAt the Byers house, Joyce finds the lights flickering through the living room, directing her to the wall.  Grabbing a tangled string of lights she asks if Will is there and that he blink once for yes, twice for no.  She finds out he's alive, but he's not safe. \n"}, {"text": "Digging up articles on Dr. Brenner, Hopper finds that he was connected to what CIA program?", "correct": "MK Ultra & M K Ultra & MKUltra", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMK Ultra & M K Ultra & MKUltra.\n\n\tJoyce continues to desperately contact Will, realizing that she needs a more assured method of getting an answer from him beyond a simple yes/no.  To accomplish this, she strings lights on the wall and paints letters underneath them, creating a keyboard with which he can respond in words.\rNancy returns home to her mother in a panic; she doesn't know where Barb is, but she thinks something terrible has happened.\rHopper continues to investigate Dr. Brenner and believes that the Hawkins Lab may be home to something bigger than anticipated, especially with Dr. Brenner's link to the CIA's MKUltra plans.  Perhaps, he thinks, Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Hopper receives a call on the walkie and they're off as fast as they can go. \n"}, {"text": "Whose body is thought to be pulled from the waters in the gorge?", "correct": "Will's", "options": ["Benny's", "Barb's", "Lonnie's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWill's.\n\n\tThe boys, now biking in the dark, head to the Byers house where Eleven says Will is hiding.  Everyone is frustrated that they're in the wrong spot, but the police sirens drive by and it seems that they have something new to investigate.\rIn the Byers house, Nancy finishes her new plan and tells Will to speak to her.  She asks where he is; he responds 'RIGHT HERE'.  She asks what she should do; he says 'RUN' as all the lights begin to flicker and something tears through the wall behind her.\rThe boys find where Hopper has been led and they find the emergency response team already there; it's the bottom of the gorge.  There, hiding behind a fire truck, they watch as Will's body is dredged from the waters.  The boys are furious and Mike bikes off.\rWhile Mike runs home, Joyce runs down the forest road to find her son coming up the drive.  The cop cars follow behind him. \n"}]}
