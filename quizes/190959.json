{"id": "190959", "name": "The Film History of Meryl Streep Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed S-Z", " Meryl Streep"], "questions": [{"text": "Meryl Streep's feature film debut came in what 1977 film that featured an all-star cast?", "correct": "Julia", "options": ["All the President's Men", "Annie Hall", "Network"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulia.\n\n\t'Julia' was directed by Fred Zinnemann and featured Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, Maximilian Schell, Hal Holbrook alongside Streep (wow!).  The story is based on the memoirs of Lillian Hellman, and features Hellman and her lover Dashiel Hammett, along with Julia, as the main characters. \n"}, {"text": "Meryl Streep received the first of her many Academy Award nominations for her performance in which of the following films?", "correct": "The Deer Hunter", "options": ["Secret Service", "The Seduction of Joe Tynan", "The Deadliest Season"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Deer Hunter.\n\n\tStreep's first Oscar nomination came for her supporting performance in the star-studded 'The Deer Hunter'.  The 1978 film, directed by Michael Cimino, also featured Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken and Meryl's one-time fianc\u00e9 John Cazale. \n"}, {"text": "Meryl Streep has worked with a number of great directors in her career.  Take for example the 1979 film 'Manhattan', which featured Streep under the direction of whom?", "correct": "Woody Allen", "options": ["George Lucas", "Martin Scorsese", "Sydney Lumet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWoody Allen.\n\n\tAgain, Meryl plays a supporting role in this terrific film from that New York auteur, Mr. Woody Allen.  Alongside Meryl appears Allen, Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway.  Oddly enough, this is the only time the two film greats have appeared together, at least up to and including 2004. \n"}, {"text": "Meryl Streep's first Academy Award victory was for her performance in the 1979 film 'Kramer vs. Kramer'.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn only her second Academy Award nomination, this one for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Meryl took home her first Oscar gold.  Her performance alongside Dustin Hoffman, who also won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Lead Role, was electric. \n"}, {"text": "Meryl Streep is a multiple Oscar winner.  One of her Academy Award victories was for her touching performance in the 1981 film 'The French Lieutenant's Woman'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMeryl was nominated for her performance in 'The French Lieutenant's Woman', her first nomination for Best Actress in a Lead Role, but she did not win.  Her first victory in that capacity was for her performance in 1982's 'Sophie's Choice'. \n"}, {"text": "One of Meryl Streep's signature roles is that of Karen Silkwood in the 1983 drama 'Silkwood'.  Which of these is not true about that film, in relation to Meryl and/or her Karen Silkwood character?", "correct": "Dennis Quaid plays Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens in the film", "options": ["Meryl and her fellow actors were directed by Mike Nichols in this film", "Meryl Streep was nominated but did not win the Best Actress Oscar for Silkwood", "Cher appears as Dolly Pelliker, friend of Karen Silkwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDennis Quaid plays Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens in the film.\n\n\tMike Nichols, of 'The Graduate' fame, was the director, and the film also featured Cher alongside Meryl, who garnered another Oscar nomination for her agonizingly believable performance as Karen Silkwood, but Dennis Quaid appears nowhere in the film.  The Drew Stephens character was portrayed by Kurt Russell. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite Meryl Streep performances came in the 1990 comedy/drama 'Postcards from the Edge'.  In this film, Meryl Streep plays a character roughly based on the life of which Hollywood actress?", "correct": "Carrie Fisher", "options": ["Susan Sarandon", "Teri Garr", "Loretta Swit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarrie Fisher.\n\n\t'Postcards from the Edge' is really an underrated film that deserves more attention.  Directed by Mike Nichols (again!), it loosely follows the life of Carrie Fisher (who becomes Suzanne Vale, portrayed by Meryl Streep) and her battle with Hollywood demons.  Shirley MacLaine takes a turn as Doris Mann (roughly based on Debbie Reynolds, Fisher's mother), and puts on a very funny performance.  Dennis Quaid does appear in this film, as do Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss, Rob Reiner, Annette Bening and several other notables.  \r I recommend it highly! \n"}, {"text": "In 1993, Meryl Streep appears as Clara del Valle Trueba in the film 'The House of the Spirits'.  Upon whose novel was this film based?", "correct": "Isabel Allende", "options": ["Laura Esquivel", "Gabriel Garcia Marquez", "Pablo Neruda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsabel Allende.\n\n\tNot a critical success, despite its great cast, the film still featured some good performances led, naturally, by Meryl Streep.  Alongside Meryl appears Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, Vanessa Redgrave and Maria Conchita Alonso. \n"}, {"text": "Who played Meryl Streep's leading man in the popular 1995 romance film 'The Bridges of Madison County'? ", "correct": "Clint Eastwood", "options": ["Gene Hackman", "Tom Hanks", "Kevin Spacey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Eastwood.\n\n\tMeryl Streep's role in this romantic drama was not surprising, but to see Clint Eastwood in a romance really did raise eyebrows.  Meryl was nominated for a stunning tenth Oscar for her role as rural housewife Francesca Johnson. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actresses did not appear alongside Meryl Streep in the very engaging drama 'The Hours' from 2002?", "correct": "Annette Bening", "options": ["Julianne Moore", "Nicole Kidman", "Miranda Richardson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnnette Bening.\n\n\tThe cast of the multiple Academy Award nominated 'The Hours' also included Ed Harris in a stunning performance.  Meryl was not nominated for an acting Oscar for this film, but Harris, Kidman and Moore were all nominated, with Kidman winning the award for Best Actress.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz, thank you for playing.
