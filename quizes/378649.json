British Army Foot Drill Online Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Military Matters", "  U.K. Military"], "questions": [{"text": "In foot drill terminology, the term 'dressing' relates to the standard of turnout of each member of the squad?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe term \"dressing\" relates to the spacing between individual soldiers and separate ranks.  To train soldiers to a level where their \"dressing\" from each other is uniform and is obtained with the minimum of fuss (the military do not tolerate fuss), troops raise their right arms and use this as a means of spacing themselves from the soldier to their right; this method is always used during their basic military training. Within a very short time, the use of the arm can be dispensed with and, on the command to \"Fall In\", trained soldiers will achieve the correct spacing left-to-right and front-to-rear instinctively and without the requirement for any further words of command. \n"}, {"text": "\"____on the right - ____on the left, in single rank size!\"  This command is used to achieve a specific aim prior to important parades.  Which of the following combinations of words are missing from this example?", "correct": "Tallest, shortest", "options": ["Brightest, dimmest", "Fattest, thinnest", "Strongest, weakest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTallest, shortest.\n\n\tNothing is less pleasing to the eye of a Drill Sergeant or a Regimental Sergeant Major than a squad of men that appear to be untidily assembled.  This drill movement will result in a squad with its tallest members on its left and right flanks moving inwards toward its shortest members at the centre; when viewed from the front, the squad will basically resemble a chevron. After the soldiers have been assembled into a single rank with the tallest soldier on the right and the shortest at the left, they will receive the word of command \"From the right, number\".  With this, each soldier will call out their number; the man on the far right being \"one\", the man to his left is \"two\" and so on down the line to the shortest man. Those men with even numbers then take a pace forward whilst the odd numbers take a pace backwards.  The front rank then turns to the right and the rear to the left.  The man on the far right remains facing his front as he is known as the right marker.  On receipt of the final command \"Quick March\" the soldiers will begin to peel off and form three ranks.  Where there are insufficient soldiers on parade to form three full ranks from front to rear, what is known as a blank file will be formed.  Where this occurs the blank file will always be at the second file from the left.  It sounds complicated when written down but it is quite a simple sequence in practice! \n"}, {"text": "The initial word of command for which of the following drill movements is always given as the left foot makes contact with the ground?", "correct": "Halt", "options": ["General Salute, Present Arms", "Left/Right Incline", "Remove Head Dress"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalt.\n\n\tIn actual fact, the majority of drill commands are given when the left foot strikes the ground.  In this case for example, the instructor wishes the squad halt as one.  In ninety-nine percent of cases any warning words of command will be given in good time in order that the squad know in advance what they are to be expected to do.  In the case of the command to halt, the warning will be given as the word \"Squaaaaaad...\"   After a break of a couple of paces the order to halt is given as the left heel hits the ground.  The squad take a further pace with the right foot, known as a check pace, before halting on the next left foot.  The resulting sound will be entirely different between a company of soldiers wearing rubber soled boots and that of, say, a company of highlanders wearing hob-nailed brogues!  The sound of a battalion of six hundred highlanders halting in complete unison simply has to be heard.\r The incorrect answer selections are genuine drill movements but are only ever executed at the halt. \n"}, {"text": "Of the following, which is the only circumstance in which a soldier or NCO is permitted to pay the compliment of a salute with his left hand? ", "correct": "Where the right arm, hand or both are incapacitated through injury.", "options": ["Where the soldier is wearing civilian clothes.", "Where an officer is positioned to your left.", "Where the officer is not a member of his/her unit."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhere the right arm, hand or both are incapacitated through injury.\n\n\tSalutes are always performed using the right hand whether on the march or at the halt.  In instances in which the right arm or hand is incapacitated through injury, a salute can be performed using the left hand; however this movement would feel entirely alien to a trained soldier.  In the most part, and in my experience, a soldier in this predicament who was required to pay the correct compliment to a commissioned officer would simply snap to attention if at the halt, or 'brace up'- a distinct movement akin to coming to attention whilst at the march, and execute an eyes right or an eyes left in the usual manner.\n"}, {"text": "On receipt of the word of command \"Mark Time!\" whilst marching at normal pace, the squad will cease forward motion and will continue to march on the spot.  Of the commands provided, which is the only one upon which a squad can act from being at this position?", "correct": "Forward", "options": ["Eyes Right", "Ground Arms", "Change Arms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForward.\n\n\tThis command is generally used as a means of correcting the dressing of large groups of soldiers that may have started to close up on each other after executing a movement such as a Form on the march.  This enables parade commanders to regain the correct spacing between ranks.  Although the modern drill manual states that drill should never be used as a method of punishment, in my day (which was around forty years ago) a squad that was not performing adequately would often receive a short, sharp drill session known affectionately as a 'beasting' often at a pace well over the usual 120 paces per minute and frequently well over the Light Infantry pace of 140 per minute. Beastings always consisted of extended periods of marking time and  failure to perform after a beasting session often meant a morning of entertainment in the Guardroom! \n"}, {"text": "From the position of attention and receiving the word of command \"Quick March\", soldiers will always take their first pace with the right foot?", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tStepping off with the right foot will always confuse the soldiers marching behind you and, one by one, each rank will collapse into chaos.  Once the soldier at fault has been identified, guess what follows very, very quickly? Yes, another period under the supervision of the Provost staff in the 'hotel on the corner'!\r Soldiers always begin marching by taking the first pace with their left foot.  There are no exceptions to this rule... Ever! \n"}, {"text": "In all instances bar one, individual soldiers or squads execute an about turn by beginning to move to the right.  The only circumstance under which it is imperative that an about turn begins with a rotation of the body to the left is whilst a soldier is employed as a Royal Guard or as a guard at HM Tower of London?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMany people who have visited one of Her Majesty's palaces will have seen this drill movement being performed.  Important duties such as those in which the soldier is in close proximity to members of the public demand that he remain vigilant and that he never turns his back to the public.  This is performed simply to ensure that access cannot be gained into any out of bounds areas whilst the sentry's back is turned... And believe me, it happens!  Those of you who have visited HM Tower of London will have seen the sentry on duty at Number One post - the post immediately outside the Wellington Barrack building - performing an About Turn to the left. Similarly, one of the two guardsmen on duty at Buckingham Palace will execute this movement whilst they are 'on patrol'.  Both will come to attention in unison, shoulder their arms, make a turn to the left or the right and proceed on a short patrol of around fifteen paces.  The sentry on the right, from the viewpoint of the observer, will carry out all drill movements in the normal manner whilst the one on the left executes them in mirror image thus never turning his back on the public and maintaining eye contact with them at all times. \n"}, {"text": "A particular drill movement is used as a means of turning large squads of soldiers across a broad front whilst on the march.  The drill manual calls this movement the 'Left Form' and the 'Right Form'.  At which annual event watched the world over will you see this complex drill movement being executed?", "correct": "The Trooping of the Colour", "options": ["The Remembrance Day march past at the Cenotaph", "The State Opening of Parliament", "The Lord Mayor of London's Show"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Trooping of the Colour.\n\n\tOf all the methods used to change the direction in which a large body of men is moving, the left or right form is the most effective.  It is possible to do this using other commands such as the left or right turn or left or right wheel.  A squad marching in file which is given the command left or right turn will move in those directions but its frontage will be altered; in file its frontage will be three soldiers wide whereas after a left turn it may have a frontage of twenty or thirty men!  The left and right form removes this and enables a squad to move anywhere on the parade ground without altering its frontage. Put simply, the squad rotates around the man at the extreme left or right of the front rank. \n"}, {"text": "Of the following, which is the only weapon to have a series of drill movements designed for it?", "correct": "The SA80 rifle", "options": ["The combat shotgun", "The General Purpose Machine Gun or GPMG", "The Browning M2 machine gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe SA80 rifle.\n\n\tThe SA80 rifle has simplified arms drill in the British Army.  Prior to its adoption, soldiers were required to learn arms drill using both the service rifle and the sub-machine gun or SMG, depending on their service arm.  Soldiers serving in cavalry units for example were issued with the SMG simply because a weapon the size of a rifle would be impractical within the confines of an armoured vehicle. The SMG was also issued to troops in the support arms such as chefs, drivers and technicians.  Since the introduction of the SA80 the SMG has been phased out and all soldiers are expected to learn to drill using the rifle alone. Of the incorrect answer selections, the GPMG and M2 are very large and very heavy support weapons, the use of which would be impractical for the purpose of drill and the combat shotgun is a specialist weapon used in close combat situations as a result of experience gained in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n"}, {"text": "One of the simplest methods of changing the direction in which a squad is moving takes its name from one of mankind's most important inventions.  From which invention does this movement take its name?", "correct": "Wheel", "options": ["Pulley ", "Lever", "Screw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWheel.\n\n\tThis manoeuvre, the wheel, is a very basic drill movement, is one of the first that recruits will learn during their basic training and is designed to move a squad through ninety degrees in situations where other drill movements may be impractical.  For example, on receiving the word of command to left wheel, the soldiers in the left hand rank will shorten their pace and begin a gradual turn to their left. The soldiers in the centre rank will maintain their pace as normal and manoeuvre in the same way whilst those soldiers in the right hand rank will extend their pace slightly with each rank moving through ninety degrees to their left. Providing that the soldiers in each rank maintain their dressing correctly, this drill movement can look very snakelike in execution but also very smart and effective to an observer.  The wheel and the form mentioned earlier are drill movements that, like many others, find their origins way back in time when drills were used to manoeuvre soldiers into position immediately before advancing into battle. \n"}]}
