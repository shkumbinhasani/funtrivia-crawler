Quiz | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "   Specialized History", "Industrial Revolution"], "questions": [{"text": "Which one of the following options is a replacement for the once very popular floppy disk?  ", "correct": "Thumb drives", "options": ["Fax machines", "Scanners", "E-mail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThumb drives.\n\n\tThe 8-inch - IBM 23FD (read only) floppy disk was introduced by IBM in 1971. It was a magnetic, information storage medium that was sealed in a square plastic carrier to protect it from dust.

They also have a memory capacity thousands of times larger than a floppy disk. \n"}, {"text": "At one time almost everyone had folded paper maps in the glove boxes of their cars.

Later airships used helium, an inert gas much less likely to cause such a disaster. There were later dirigible-type airships using helium that crashed but none of them caught fire or exploded. There were also some dirigibles flying at the same time that did use helium but it was hard to obtain and thus hydrogen was used with fatal results. \n"}, {"text": "A tintype was an early form of which of the following options?", "correct": "Photograph", "options": ["Typewriter", "Microwave oven", "Television"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhotograph.\n\n\tA tintype was a cheap early type of photograph often made at carnivals, fairs and on sea-fronts in the late 19th century.

In the middle part of the century a large outbreak of polio resulted in thousands of people being put into the apparatus when their diaphragm as well as their other muscles became paralyzed.The iron lung was a large full body size ventilator into which a patient was put, with only their head outside of the apparatus. Most people recovered and were taken out of the machine but there were those who spent up to 60 years in an iron lung.While use of the iron lung almost disappeared during the 1960's as new and better treatments were developed it was estimated that between 25-30 people in the US were being kept alive in an iron lung at the turn of the 21st century. \n"}, {"text": "Objects called the clepsydra and the vertical gnomon were all very early inventions that measured which of the following important things?", "correct": "Time", "options": ["Height", "Weight", "Density"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTime.\n\n\tAll of things were used to measure time.
