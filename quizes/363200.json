{"id": "363200", "name": "Love, \"Amazingly\" Multiple Choice Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "Amazing Race"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 2\", second place team Tara and Wil had several outbursts on the race course.  Some claimed that Tara sabotaged their victory in the last leg of the race, mainly by doing which of these?", "correct": "Running too slowly", "options": ["Telling another team a better flight", "Holding up a cab", "Heading purposely offcourse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRunning too slowly.\n\n\tThis couple's race was tumultuous.  Separated before the race even began the couple started out strong and never fell below fifth place during the game but Wil's childishness and Tara's spite came to a head several times throughout.  On many occasions, Tara was seen bunking up with eventual winners Chris and Alex while Wil watched on.  Shouting matches punctuated the journey while Wil got into arguments with other teams, particularly sibling duo Blake and Paige. In the final leg of the race in San Francisco, Wil notably got out of the car several times to throw Chris and Alex offtrack and, when they finally arrived at the finish line destination in the lead, Chris and Alex overtook Wil and Tara in a footrace to claim the million. Tara, unable to keep up with her ex-husband in the run, was seen walking once the boys passed her.  Unsurprisingly they didn't stay together after the race. \n"}, {"text": "The winners of \"The Amazing Race 3\", Flo and Zach, were noteworthy in the sense that Zach was a saint in dealing with his partner.  In which country did Flo genuinely break down during a Detour task?", "correct": "Vietnam", "options": ["Germany", "Switzerland", "Mexico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVietnam.\n\n\tAlthough it wasn't the only time Flo lost it, Vietnam was her...well...'Nam.  While other teams like Teri and Ian marveled at the post-war country (particularly poignant since Ian served in 'Nam), Flo and Zach struggled with their relationship and her inability to accomplish certain tasks.  In a choice between paddling a unique boat or biking with heavy basket-laden bicycles, Flo was miserable; Zach ultimately paid a local to paddle his partner's boat to the next clue. Flo also had personal struggles in Switzerland, Singapore, and other foreign countries, usually breaking into tears.  Nonetheless they won, partly because Zach picked up the slack (he did ten Road Blocks to her one).  After the race Zach broke up with Flo; she said she wouldn't race again, partly because of the way it changed her. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Amazing Race 6\" featured the vitriolic relationship of Jonathan and Victoria, an almost unnerving team.  Their most memorable moment occurred in Germany; according to their argument, who was allegedly to blame for their (horrible) second place finish in front of the Brandenburg Gate?", "correct": "Victoria", "options": ["Phil Keoghan", "Jonathan", "Their taxi driver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictoria.\n\n\tLeg 5 was intense.  Heading from Senegal to Berlin, Germany, teams passed through several tasks in the city culminating in a drive to the Brandenburg Gate and the Pit Stop.  Jonathan and Victoria, leading through a fair bit of the leg, were passed at the last moment by Freddy and Kendra and Jonathan lost it-- yelling at Victoria to drop their bags he rushed ahead but Victoria, afraid that someone would steal their belongings, picked his up and wept her way to second place. Jonathan decided to push her before stepping on the mat and arguing; Phil simply said that they needed to have a talk.  The antics didn't end there. Their arguing carried into Leg 6 with something as simple as a sign-up board.  It happened again when Victoria hurt herself in Ethiopia, prompting other teams to yell at him for the callous disregard for his wife's safety.  They were eliminated in Leg 8, but not after Victoria was selected to complete some of the race's most difficult Road Blocks to date. \n"}, {"text": "After coming in last place during an exhausting penultimate leg in China in \"The Amazing Race 6\", who proposed to his teammate?", "correct": "Aaron", "options": ["Bolo", "Freddy", "Jon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAaron.\n\n\tYes, \"The Amazing Race 6\" again.  This time, Hayden and Aaron were front-runners through most of the game.  Although she was occasionally emotional, they worked together to persevere through most of the challenges.  Leg 11 proved to be a breaking point though.  Both of them, exhausted and unable to communicate with drivers in Xi'an, fell to the back of the pack as Hayden blistered her hands trying to open locks on the top of Mount Hua.  She didn't in time; they were eliminated in that leg. At the Pit Stop mat on the Xi'an City Wall he dropped to one knee and proposed to her-- something he planned to do at the Finish Line. She said yes. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 6\" (again, haha), Adam and Rebecca had a rocky relationship, partly because of his immaturity.  At one point, what did he threaten to do?", "correct": "Jump onto some train tracks", "options": ["Drown in a Norwegian lake", "Leap off a bridge", "Shoot himself in the face"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJump onto some train tracks.\n\n\tThis instance actually happened early on.  Adam (nicknamed Hellboy because of his decision to create tiny horns out of his hair), realizing his rocky relationship, decided that it would be wise to threaten to jump onto some train tracks in Scandinavia.  Similar instances happened later on in Budapest.  Hilariously, many of the contestants realized that Adam was little more than a weak mamma's boy.  Rebecca learned this in one of the first few legs of the race, and it was obvious when she decided to break it off.  They placed third, surprisingly. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 7\", beauty queen Kelly put a nail in the coffin of her relationship by claiming that her partner, Ron, got out of all responsibilities, especially the army, by becoming which of these?", "correct": "A P.O.W.", "options": ["A homosexual", "A wimp", "A father"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA P.O.W.\n\n\tDuring the final leg of the race the final three teams headed to Jamaica and Puerto Rico and things got worse for the already rocky couple.  Ron, relieved from duty in the U.S. Army after becoming a prisoner of war in Afghanistan following 9/11, joined the race with former beauty queen Kelly.  After their bickering came to a head in a cab ride, the following interaction occurred:\r Kelly: \"You get out of all responsibilites in life.\"\rRon: \"Oh yeah, what about the army?\"\rKelly: \"You got out of the army by being a P.O.W.\"\r He also got out of their relationship at the end of the race.  They placed third. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Amazing Race 10\" gave a good deal of coverage to Peter and Sarah, a trainer and his girlfriend.  His handicap was yelling at her; what was hers?", "correct": "She had an artificial leg", "options": ["She was deaf", "She had a pacemaker", "She was in a wheelchair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe had an artificial leg.\n\n\tIn this season of multi-ethnic, multi-handicapable contestants, Peter and Sarah stood out due to Sarah's prosthetic leg which, despite expectations, proved to cause even more of an issue than one would think.  In the first couple of legs, the first leg broke its hydraulic joint causing immediate issues. As if that weren't bad enough, Peter's encouragements soon became nothing more than yelling.  Sarah was relegated to grueling physical tasks (for instance physically ascending the limestone cliff faces of Halong Bay, Vietnam during a fairly obvious Road Block).  They were eliminated in Kuwait after getting lost in the desert, though not before it damaged their friendship. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 15\", Mika and Canaan ended their relationship because of which of the following?", "correct": "A water slide", "options": ["Another woman", "Simple math", "A box of hookahs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA water slide.\n\n\tDating country couple Mika and Canaan made it halfway around the world in this race, coming to Dubai in Leg 5 and persevering into Leg 6 despite never topping seventh place.  What ensued at the Palm Jumeirah Atlantis resort was nothing short of amazing.  Being forced to ride down the Leap of Faith water slide to get a clue at the bottom (taking them to the Pit Stop), Mika froze up.  At one point Canaan tried pushing her. It took the trailing Globetrotters Flight Time and Big Easy a half hour to catch up and another two minutes of goading to persuade her not to do it before they passed them up and got them eliminated. Mika and Canaan were eliminated, they broke up almost immediately after, and they have the distinction of not riding a water slide for a million bucks. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 17\", one teams's relationship was put to the test in Hong Kong when Vicki's asthma flared up and her partner, Nick, decided that it was no excuse.  When they took to the harbour during a Detour on a sampan, what did he decide to do?", "correct": "Nap", "options": ["Quit", "Jump overboard", "Toss her belongings into the harbour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNap.\n\n\tThe race is exhausting, especially on a relationship, but I guess some have their limits.  Nick and Vicki were a surprising team to make it into the penultimate leg of the race, but despite spats through Africa, Scandinavia, Russia, and parts of Eastern Asia, they made it work... until Hong Kong.  After Vicki's asthma stopped them from catching a crucial ferry, Nick had Vicki perform a gut-filling sushi-themed Road Block (to the point of nausea).  Then, during the Detour, feeling that all was hopeless, he took a nap on the sampan, leaving Vicki to finish alone. She didn't.  They took a major penalty, coming in last during the non-elimination leg but falling so far behind (six hours on top of their departure time) that they arrived in South Korea too late to complete Leg 11. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Amazing Race 20\", angry teams were about.  Brendon and Rachel were plagued by...well...Rachel's emotions.  Where did they meet?", "correct": "On another reality TV show", "options": ["In a casting call for \"The Amazing Race\"", "In a strip club", "On their honeymoons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn another reality TV show.\n\n\tCBS has had a long history of flipping contestants between reality shows (usually \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\" alumni head to \"The Amazing Race\").  The twentieth race brought \"Big Brother 13\" winner Rachel and her on-show boyfriend Brendon to the table and, despite her constant arguing with other team Vanessa and Ralph, they managed to weep their way into third place in Hawaii, but not before her lack of self-confidence (and the sweep by other arguing couple Rachel and Dave) squandered any chance at a first-place win in any leg. Despite their differences, Brendon and Rachel married after the show. \n"}]}
