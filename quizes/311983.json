{"id": "311983", "name": "\"World of Warcraft\" - Ashenvale Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "World of Warcraft - Locations", "Vanilla WoW Locations"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the name of the major Horde outpost in Ashenvale?", "correct": "Splintertree Post", "options": ["Satyrnaar", "Forest Song", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplintertree Post.\n\n\tSplintertree Post, if you're coming from the south, will be down the right fork on the major road.  This larger-sized settlement will be important to visit for any Horde players passing through and hoping to jump into quests for their level range.  Splintertree contains one of the two flight path locations for Horde in Ashenvale as well as numerous quest NPCs, traders, and trainers. Although none of this may be of use to players of certain levels and professions, it's good to keep around on the map.  Outside Splintertree Post is a watchtower by the edge of the road; Horde players can probably find more quests here as well. \n"}, {"text": "What is the capital city of Ashenvale?", "correct": "Astranaar", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAstranaar.\n\n\tThis Night Elf-centric city (clearly run by the Alliance)is found in the middle of Ashenvale, cutting into the path across the map from east to west.  Although this Alliance city is the largest in the zone, its placement is in between two major Horde flight path points.  Astranaar also acts as a flight path for Alliance players, going to six different locations directly. Due to Astranaar's influence on its surroundings, many of the NPCs found throughout Ashenvale will be Alliance and will attack Horde players.  Astranaar, much like any other major outpost, will contain some trainers and traders, but little more. \n"}, {"text": "Ashenvale is a contested zone.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tMuch like The Barrens to the south, Ashenvale continues with the theme of 'somewhat-neutrality' with both Alliance and Horde having faction-specific towns.  Unlike The Barrens, however, players can't enter each others' town without being hostile.  Splintertree Post remains the Horde outpost while Astranaar remains the Alliance settlement.  Additionally, Zoram'Gar Outpost and Forest Song are outposts for Horde and Alliance, respectively.  Both of these contain flight path locations for their respective sides though they are smaller than their counterparts and further off the beaten path. \n"}, {"text": "Zoram'Gar Outpost is on the tip of which location?", "correct": "The Zoram Strand", "options": ["Satyrnaar", "The Zoram Tides", "The Zoram Coast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Zoram Strand.\n\n\tThe Zoram Strand is also home to the sole instance found in within Ashenvale.  While Zoram'Gar Outpost is found on the southern end of the beach, Blackfathom Deeps is on the north.  There is very little indication on the main path through Ashenvale that you are heading in the direction of both the Zoram Strand and Zoram'Gar Outpost, but all you need to do is make a left off the path in front of Maestra's Post to reach it.  Zoram'Gar Outpost is quite empty as a location. While it will contain a flight path for Horde players, its contents are rather few for high level players (in terms of quests).  All other players will merely find a fishing trainer and a small trading location. \n"}, {"text": "Kargathia Keep can be found at which of these locations?", "correct": "Warsong Lumber Camp", "options": ["Felfire Hill", "Thistlefur Village", "Bloodtooth Camp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarsong Lumber Camp.\n\n\tWarsong Lumber Camp can be found in the southeast portion of Ashenvale, and while Alliance territory is found in the areas around Forest Song in the same direction, Warsong is entirely Horde-based, backing onto Orgrimmar and Durotar across the river behind.  Kargathia Keep is a large building along the cliffs here. Run by the Warsong clan of Orcs, the Lumber Camp is a largely industrial area full of large machines and clear of monsters.  The closest open area for monsters would be Felfire Hill at which one can find some of the more difficult enemies of Ashenvale.  Splintertree Post can be found just north up the path from Felfire. \n"}, {"text": "Night Run and Xavian are homes to many Satyr enemies.  Which is another of their settlements?", "correct": "Satyrnaar", "options": ["Felfire Hill", "Raynewood Retreat", "Maestra's Post"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSatyrnaar.\n\n\tSatyrnaar is located between Splintertree Post, a Horde city in the east, and Forest Song, an Alliance location even further east towards the eastern border.  This location is the largest of three Satyr-based locations in Ashenvale while Night Run is found on top of a cliffside and consists of nothing more than a few campsites and ruins and Xavian is found further north of Satyrnaar and contains a few important figures to defeat. Satyr-centric quests can be attempted at different locations depending on whether you're Alliance or Horde, but it's not integral in the quest for you to visit all three in most situations. \n"}, {"text": "Shael'Dryn is found in the north end of Ashenvale at a Moonwell.  What is true about her?", "correct": "She's on the Alliance side", "options": ["She isn't alive", "She's on the Horde side", "She rides a mount"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's on the Alliance side.\n\n\tShael'Dryn's Moonwell can be found to the northwest of Raynewood Retreat next to Iris Lake (east of Astranaar).  This Alliance-based NPC gives players numerous steps in finishing the Raene's Cleansing quest which takes players all around Ashenvale.  There are numerous Moonwells located all over the \"World of Warcraft\" map, three of which can be found in the borders of Ashenvale; the other two are found near Raynewood Retreat and Greenpaw Village, though their importance is solely based on your character's faction. \n"}, {"text": "Which zone borders Ashenvale to the east?", "correct": "Azshara", "options": ["Darkshore", "Felwood", "Thousand Needles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAzshara.\n\n\tAshenvale sits directly north of The Barrens and northwest of Durotar, making the progression through these areas seem almost natural for Horde players coming from the south.  This area is particularly for players level 20 to 30 in terms of quests and leveling, but it's quite necessary to pass through this on the way to some of the higher leveled zones surrounding it.  Darkshore, a lower-level Alliance area, is in the northwest of Ashenvale next to Felwood, for level 48-55 players. Azshara is from level 45-55 while the adjacent Stonetalon Mountains, which doesn't actually connect to Ashenvale, has a similar level range to this neutral zone. Thousand Needles is on the opposite end of The Barrens to the south.  It's a contested area for players just leaving Ashenvale if they so choose. \n"}, {"text": "Blackfathom Deeps is the only instance found in Ashenvale.  It is primarily recommended for players above level 50.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBlackfathom Deeps is an instance found on the north part of the Zoram Strand on the far west coast of Ashenvale, just down the beach from Zoram'Gar Outpost.  Typically, the instance is for players from level 20-27 though it's safe to say that it is more difficult than earlier missions in the game (ie. Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, etc.).  To reach the dungeon entrance, players need to drop down into some ruins and swim under the foundation to find a set of caves. This will contain the instance portal.  Aku'mai, a hydra boss, is the final opponent you'll face here.  While there are no NPCs that give a quest regarding this creature, her defeat is necessary in completing the dungeon and earning your achievement. Eight different bosses can be found in this instance. \n"}, {"text": "The Alliance entrance to which battleground can be found in Ashenvale?", "correct": "Warsong Gulch", "options": ["Alterac Valley", "Bough Shadow", "The Shady Nook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarsong Gulch.\n\n\tWhile the Alliance can enter Warsong Gulch near the Silverwing Outpost in the south entrance to Ashenvale, Horde players can enter the same battlefield from the mountain range next to Mor'Shan Base Camp in The Barrens.  This battleground is one of the earliest ones available to visit in the game due to its rather large level groups (going from level 10-19 onwards).  Some major cities around the world will also teleport you directly to the Battlegrounds if you speak to their battle masters. Alliance players will side with Night Elf forces while the Horde will side with the Orcs in this head-to-head battle arena. \n"}]}
