{"id": "394364", "name": "\"The Ring\" - The Cursed Tape Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", " The Ring"], "questions": [{"text": "The video commences with a prolonged take of running water.  Rachel later encounters this image during which of these moments?", "correct": "When she's riding the ferry to Moesko Island", "options": ["When her car crashes into the ocean", "When she's at home pouring a glass of water", "When she spends time at a local swimming pool"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen she's riding the ferry to Moesko Island.\n\n\tThe roiling waters, depicted in black and white on the VHS tape, don't have significance to Rachel until she's already on the way to Moesko Island to visit the Morgan family and dig deeper into the mystery.  While on the ferry, her presence seems to aggravate a horse being transported across the water, and when it breaks free and leaps to attack her, it accidentally tumbles over the guardrail, plunging below the ferry and getting chopped up in the propellors.  When Rachel sees the water as it is in the video, it's blood red. \n"}, {"text": "A scene depicts a single chair in a white room.  Who is later seen, in another video, sitting in that chair?", "correct": "Samara", "options": ["Anna", "Noah", "Aidan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamara.\n\n\tThe single chair, seen alone in an otherwise empty room, is occupied by Samara in her videos from the psych ward; she was questioned while sitting in the chair.  Interestingly, Rachel and Noah later find a single wooden chair sitting in the center of the loft in the barn on the Morgan ranch on Moesko Island, the spot where Samara was forced to sleep after she was adopted by the family.  The chair is seen for a third time, though in a dream that Rachel has.  She finds Samara sitting in the chair in Aidan's room. \n"}, {"text": "A mirror is seen several times in the video.  Anna Morgan appears in it, doing which of these activities?", "correct": "Brushing her hair", "options": ["Brushing her teeth", "Flossing", "Admiring her reflection"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrushing her hair.\n\n\tThe scene seems to flip back and forth between two mirrors.  In one, Anna Morgan brushes her hair and in the other, further down the wall, Samara stands, staring at her reflection.  Rachel later finds the exact mirror in the Morgan household, coming across it when she's let in for the first time as an indication that she's definitely on the right track.  Whether or not the reflective surface and the people in it is meant to be symbolic is left in the air, but Anna is seen on both sides of the mirror; Samara is only seen inside of it. \n"}, {"text": "A man stands in the upper window of a house looking out.  Who is the man?", "correct": "Samara's father", "options": ["Samara's killer", "Aidan", "Noah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSamara's father.\n\n\tRichard Morgan is revealed to be the man in the scene when Rachel arrives on Moesko Island and finds the Morgan Ranch.  The house there is the one seen at this point in the film, and while she looks up at the window at one point, there's no one in it.  Instead, Rachel finds Richard in the barn tending to his chores.  Richard later kills himself-- on Rachel's sixth day-- by electrocuting him in the bathtub, afraid that Samara would never stop seeking out her vengeance. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel discovers that she is able to pull which of these out of the film screen?", "correct": "A fly", "options": ["A cord", "A needle", "Hair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fly.\n\n\tDuring one scene, the camera looks at a windy cliffside overlooking the sea, and at that point in the video it seems as though there's a fly stuck to the camera's lens, though at a distance.  When Rachel pauses the video at this point, looking through the scenes for any clues, she notices that the fly is still moving despite being on the film.  She reaches in to it and, somehow, pulls it out of the screen before someone arrives to find her staring incredulously. \n"}, {"text": "Which image, seen in the tape, is also found under the wallpaper in the barn loft?", "correct": "Burning tree", "options": ["Ring", "Ladder", "Maggots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBurning tree.\n\n\tThe burning tree appears a handful of times in the film though it gives a lot of insight into Samara's abilities.  Her being able to imprint images onto the psych hospital lithographs and to burn the image of the tree into her loft wall hints at her psychic abilities and indicates how she created the video tape.  When Rachel and Aidan find the tree on the wall at the end of day six, Rachel determines she must go back to where she saw the tree, where it all started, where she found the tape at the Shelter Mountain Inn. \n"}, {"text": "An image of a glass of water on a table is shown in the video.  What emerges from beneath the table?", "correct": "Centipede", "options": ["Small child", "Snake", "Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentipede.\n\n\tWhile the centipede doesn't play much of a role in the movie, its appearance in the film is one of a handful that acts as a connection between real life and the video.  The centipede is found in real life when Rachel searches through a stack of old papers.\rA glass of water also seems to be important.  After drinking a glass of water, Rachel dislodges the string in her throat, attached to which is a sensor from Samara's psychiatric evaluation.  This proves to be a moment in Rachel's nightmare which culminates in her finding Samara sitting in Aidan's room. \n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of the tape, several animals are seen washed up, dead, on a beach.  What animals are they?", "correct": "Horses", "options": ["Whales", "Lobsters", "Seagulls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorses.\n\n\tAs Rachel later finds out, several horses died under mysterious circumstances on Moesko Island shortly after Samara's arrival at the Morgan Ranch.  This also ties into the events experienced by Rachel on the ferry when the horse encountered there, spooked by Rachel directly, kills itself by leaping over the guardrail in an attempt to charge her.  It's believed that Samara's ability to etch images onto the minds of others is what tormented the horses to commit suicide. \n"}, {"text": "One of the later scenes of the video shows someone committing suicide.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe scene actually shows Anna Morgan falling off the cliff seen earlier in the video, likely a direct representation of Anna Morgan's actual suicide, undertaken after she killed Samara.  The scene is intercut with images of a ladder, once upright, falling and clattering to the ground.  Rachel doesn't visit the cliff in the film, but she does see the ladder very early on; there's one just like it outside of Noah's apartment building and another in the barn, leading up to Samara's loft. \n"}, {"text": "What, as it is later discovered, is the ring?", "correct": "The rim of a well cover", "options": ["A reel of film", "The iris of an eye", "A coven of witches"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe rim of a well cover.\n\n\tThe ring itself, seen at the very start of the film and sealing again before the end, is later discovered to be the lid of a well found under the cabin at the Shelter Mountain Inn, the final resting place of Samara after she was thrown inside by her mother and left to die for seven days.  The final scene of the video shows the well, then in the middle of the woods, standing idle.  This final scene also appears on Noah's TV screen moments before Samara emerges from it. \n"}]}
