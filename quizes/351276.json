{"id": "351276", "name": "Survivor: Gabon Online Trivia | Survivor: Gabon | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: Gabon"], "questions": [{"text": "On Day 1, how were tribes chosen?", "correct": "In a pick beginning with the oldest castaways", "options": ["They were pre-determined", "They were selected by the winner of an Individual Immunity challenge", "They were pulled from a random lottery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a pick beginning with the oldest castaways.\n\n\tOn Day 1, eighteen people from the United States were dropped into the jungle in nothing but their street clothes and led into the wilderness by Gabonese locals.  Upon arriving in a rolling valley, they were asked to introduce themselves by name and occupation (real or false).  After this, they were asked to pick out their oldest members (Bob and Gillian) who would begin the tribe selection process.  They were allowed to pick anyone of any gender and their selections would make the next choices.  Immediately after, they had their first challenge. \n"}, {"text": "The original buffs for this season of the competition were yellow and which other colour?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Green", "Blue", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tBefore the first challenge, the tribes were split into Kota (donning yellow buffs) and Fang (donning red).  Immediately after, they needed to work together (or individually) to get through a course and to the top of a steep hill to win reward and Individual Immunity.  Each tribe was eligible for Individual Immunities-- these were won by GC on Fang and Marcus on Kota.  In addition, the first tribe to have all of the members cross the line would win an extra bag of corn and beans to add to their rations.  Kota won and commenced a streak of subsequent victories. \n"}, {"text": "Which castaway visited Exile Island the most during the season?", "correct": "Sugar", "options": ["Bob", "Dan", "Susie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugar.\n\n\tOver the course of the game's thirty-nine days, Sugar went to Exile Island a total of five times, all of which were before the tribal merge.  She was the second person to visit and was sent each subsequent time, once as a result of a tribal switch on Day 10 and each other time as a selection from the opposing team.  She visited so many teams early on in the competition that she nicknamed the location 'The Sugar Shack'.  Bob visited twice after the merge. \n"}, {"text": "Who found the Hidden Immunity Idol this season?", "correct": "Sugar", "options": ["Randy", "Matt", "GC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugar.\n\n\tThis season, when a castaway was sent to Exile Island they were told that they could choose between a clue to the idol or comfort in the form of a private cabana containing fruit and a hammock.\rWhen Sugar went to Exile Island for the first time (as its second visitor) on Day 7, she followed the clues near-perfectly and located the Hidden Immunity Idol quite effectively.  As a result she ended up sitting in the luxury of 'Eden' during all of her later visits.  Because the idol was not used until late in the game, all later visitors to Exile Island were unable to claim an idol. \n"}, {"text": "How many castaways became jury members before the merge?", "correct": "One", "options": ["Three", "None", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne.\n\n\tTribes experienced their first switch-up on Day 10.  After ordering themselves by importance after a poll, they all dropped their buffs and the top person on each tribe (Marcus and Matty) ended up selecting new tribe members to mix the game up.\rOn Day 22, the tribes met once again for a feast during which they anticipated a merge.  They were, however, treated to another switch and Marcus was eliminated from the game.  Before the Immunity Challenge on Day 26, the tribes merged; Marcus was the only person not from the merged tribe to end up on the jury. \n"}, {"text": "When Fang and Kota merged, what name did they take on?", "correct": "Nobag", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNobag.\n\n\tOn Day 27, Fang and Kota combined before their Immunity Challenge to form Nobag, named after their country for the season (Gabon), but backwards.  Nobag donned a light blue buff.  When the tribe finished their first challenge (won by Susie), they headed back to camp to get their customary merge feast and remained at the original Fang base.  Nobag, at its start, had nine members; six of those castaways became jury members and three became finalists. \n"}, {"text": "Who won most individual (post-merge) challenges?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Randy", "Susie", "Ken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tAfter the merge on Day 27, the individual castaways competed in eight different challenges (and the auction).  Two were Reward Challenges and six were for Individual Immunity.  Bob won five challenges (both rewards and three immunities) while Susie won two and Ken won one.  Bob actually won five consecutive challenges during the game (every challenge from Day 31 onwards except the final Immunity Challenge) and promised Ken immunity on Day 37, but held back at the last minute. \n"}, {"text": "Who ultimately used the Hidden Immunity Idol to negate votes cast against them?", "correct": "Matty", "options": ["Randy", "Crystal", "Corinne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatty.\n\n\tHeading to Tribal Council on Day 36, the remaining six members of Nobag tried to make their way to the next stage of the game.  In an attempt to maintain certain alliances, Sugar handed her yet-to-be-used idol off to Matty to protect him from voting possibilities.  When he presented the idol before the vote, it turned out that he did not need it; Crystal was eliminated four votes to two.  Regardless, his two votes were wiped clean.  This was the final Tribal Council in which the idol could be used, so Exile Island was retired following this event. \n"}, {"text": "The Tribal Council for the final four resulted in which of these?", "correct": "A fire-making tiebreaker", "options": ["A quitting tribe member", "A unanimous vote", "There was no final four vote; a contestant left due to injury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fire-making tiebreaker.\n\n\tWhen the final four headed to Tribal Council on Day 38, Susie was the one with the Immunity Necklace.  Due to remaining voting blocs, Sugar and Bob had teamed up and Susie and Matty stuck together creating an unbreakable tie during the voting ceremony.  This resulted in Bob and Matty competing one-on-one in a fire-making challenge, as is customary at this point in the game.  Bob was the only one to even start a fire. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the Sole Survivor of \"Survivor: Gabon\"?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Susie", "Sugar", "Matty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tAfter thirty-nine days, a jury of seven cast their votes to give Bob the million dollar prize.  This made Bob the oldest winner of the competition to date.  During the final reveal of the votes, Bob ended up taking the nominations of four earlier castaways, all of whom were the first four to join the jury-- Marcus, Charlie, Randy, and Corinne.  Susie received votes from Crystal, Ken, and Matty while Sugar, who didn't receive any votes during earlier Tribal Councils, also didn't receive any votes for the million either. \n"}]}
