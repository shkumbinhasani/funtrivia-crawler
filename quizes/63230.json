{"id": "63230", "name": "Theatre Mysteries Multiple Choice Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Plays"], "questions": [{"text": "In my opinion, the best play of the genre is 'Sleuth'. Who wrote it?", "correct": "Anthony Shaffer", "options": ["Marsha Norman", "Wendy Wasserstein", "David Rabe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnthony Shaffer.\n\n\tBrilliant writing by Anthony Shaffer - who never quite found the formula again. 'Murderer' and 'Whodunit' were his - but they were pale imitations which enjoyed (deservedly) only modest success. (Don't judge this fine play by the mediocre movie version that followed). \n"}, {"text": "'Equus' is a bit of a stretch here. The play doesn't deal with identifying who committed the crime; it focuses on a different issue.", "correct": "Why the crime was committed", "options": ["If a crime was committed", "Where the crime was committed", "When the crime was committed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhy the crime was committed.\n\n\tWe know from the start who did the deed, but the question is: why did he do it? A psychological piece from the talented writer who gave us 'Black Comedy' and 'Amadeus', among other fine works. \n"}, {"text": "'Mousetrap' was a huge hit with a long, long run. Who wrote it?", "correct": "Agatha Christie", "options": ["Tony Kushner", "David Mamet", "Peter Shaffer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgatha Christie.\n\n\tOne of the earliest mystery plays to have a big success. \n"}, {"text": "This play is the longest running off-Broadway non-musical.", "correct": "'Perfect Crime'", "options": ["'Murderer'", "'Getting Away With Murder'", "'Whodunit'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Perfect Crime'.\n\n\t'Murderer' and 'Whodunit' are by Anthony Shaffer - (see comments to question 1). 'Getting Away' is co-authored by (of all people) Stephen Sondheim. Why 'Perfect Crime' has done so well is a mystery to me: it's not very good. \n"}, {"text": "The author of 'Deathtrap' also wrote this popular novel.", "correct": "'Rosemary's Baby'", "options": ["'The Exorcist'", "'The Prize'", "'Strangers When We Meet'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Rosemary's Baby'.\n\n\tIra Levin wrote both. 'Deathtrap' has been very successful, but it has a weak second act and a weaker ending. Go figure. \n"}, {"text": "'The Letter' was turned into a good Bette Davis movie. Who was the author of the play?", "correct": "Somerset Maugham", "options": ["Thornton Wilder", "Ayn Rand", "Ambrose Bierce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomerset Maugham.\n\n\tIt was Maugham ('Of Human Bondage'). Again, we know who committed the crime - the question is: why did she do it? \n"}, {"text": "'Witness for the Prosecution' was a big hit. To whom does the title refer?", "correct": "The suspect's wife", "options": ["The suspect", "The victim", "The victim's husband"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe suspect's wife.\n\n\tMarlene Dietrich in the fine movie version with Charles Laughton. \n"}, {"text": "'Murder in the Cathedral' may not fit comfortably with the other entries here, but it does concern murder. Who wrote it?", "correct": "T.S. Eliot", "options": ["Brendan Behan", "Ezra Pound", "Terence Rattigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT.S. Eliot\n\n\tYes, he did plays, too. \n"}, {"text": "Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' was described as 'The Macbeth Murder Mystery' in a famous essay by this writer.", "correct": "James Thurber", "options": ["Ogden Nash", "Will Rogers", "Al Capp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Thurber.\n\n\tCute idea, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "'Ten Little Indians' was a classic whodunit. By which of these other titles is it also known?", "correct": "And Then There Were None", "options": ["In The Zone", "Night of January 16", "Foxfire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnd Then There Were None.\n\n\tThere are too many movie versions of this to count. Some work well, some are less fortunate. \n"}]}
