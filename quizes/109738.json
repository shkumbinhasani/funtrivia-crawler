{"id": "109738", "name": "Ultimate LOTR:  Fellowship, Part 3 Quiz | Literature | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "The Fellowship of the Ring"], "questions": [{"text": "We begin at the Council of Elrond.  The topic of discussion: what should be done with Bilbo Baggins' most significant possession, Isildur's Bane...the one ring?  Various suggestions are made: drop it to the bottom of the sea, take it west, destroy it somehow.  None of these choices is satisfactory in Elrond's mind; the ring must be delivered back to the fire pits from whence it was first molded.  Who first offers to deliver the ring to Mordor?", "correct": "Bilbo", "options": ["Gandalf", "Frodo", "Aragorn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilbo.\n\n\tBilbo Baggins bravely offers to finish the 'affair' that he had started so many years back.  Gandalf suggests, however, that the task is beyond Bilbo's power, and that someone else must take it to be destroyed.  Frodo is next to make an offer: 'I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way.'  The trek will begin anew! \n"}, {"text": "Prior to setting out, eight companions are selected for Frodo: the men, Boromir and Aragorn, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the three hobbits, Sam, Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf.  Each carries with him a weapon, swords, knives, axes and bows.  Gandalf carries a sword, the same he wielded in 'The Hobbit'.  What is his elven-sword called?", "correct": "Glamdring", "options": ["Orcrist", "Narsil", "And\u00faril"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlamdring.\n\n\tGlamdring is the mate of Orcrist, the sword of the dwarf Thorin from 'The Hobbit'.  And\u00faril is the sword of Aragorn, also to be wielded on the journey.  Frodo carries his uncle Bilbo's sword, Sting, while the other three hobbits take along the swords they acquired from the Barrow-Wight.  Legolas, of course, has his bow and a knife, while Gimli takes along his trusty axe.  Finally, Boromir has a long sword by his side, and also carries a horn of Gondor, which he blows loudly just before the Fellowship departs from Rivendell. \n"}, {"text": "From Rivendell, the company passes along the Misty Mountains, and several ways are discussed for their crossing to the east.  Gimli discusses fondly the possibility of heading through the Black Pit, Moria.  What is the Dwarvish name for this dark abode of the dwarves under the Misty Mountains?", "correct": "Khazad-d\u00fbm", "options": ["Kibil-n\u00e2la", "Kheled-z\u00e2ram", "Azanulbizar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKhazad-d\u00fbm.\n\n\tWe find later that the Fellowship has no choice but to follow this path, through Moria, much to Gandalf's chagrin.  Gandalf fears Moria and foresees his own doom there... the Balrog! \n"}, {"text": "While trekking along the Misty Mountains the Fellowship are watched by spies of the evil forces aligned against them.  One group of spies is the 'crebain'... what type of creatures are these that menace our friends?", "correct": "Crows", "options": ["Wolves", "Goblins", "Orcs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrows.\n\n\tThese black birds swarm along the mountains and the River Greyflood in search of intruders.  The company is forced to avoid making fires so that they may not be seen by these spies of Sauron and Saruman, a fact that especially the hobbits resent.  No hot food! \n"}, {"text": "Gandalf chooses to bring the troupe across the Redhorn Gate, a high pass along one of the great mountains of the Misty Mountain range.  Along which colossal mount do they attempt to travel through snow and wind?", "correct": "Caradhras", "options": ["Celebdil", "Cloudyhead", "Silvertine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaradhras.\n\n\tCaradhras proves unpassable for our friends, the angry mountain lobs giant stones at Frodo and friends, and a great blizzard creates a wall of snow that becomes impenetrable for the tiny hobbits.  In the end they choose the way through Khazad-d\u00fbm... \n"}, {"text": "Since the company is unable to make its way across the great mountain pass, the way through the Dwarven abode under the mountains is selected as a second choice.  Unfortunately, when the doors are revealed to Gandalf upon the mountain wall, he is unable to conjure up the password to open the stone portal.  Finally, he realizes that the inscription 'Speak, Friend and enter' is a riddle.  What is the Elvish word for 'friend' that Gandalf shouts, cleaving the doors with his voice?  ", "correct": "Mellon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMellon.\n\n\tGandalf is a crafty and wizened old enchanter, but he is not omniscient.  Frustrated for a good spell, he finally takes a queue from Merry's enunciation of the code phrase, 'Say friend, and enter.'  Sadly, at this point they must abandon old Bill (the pony)... Sam especially is stricken with despair at losing his very good companion. \n"}, {"text": "Deep in the bowels of Moria the Fellowship traverses through darkness and danger.  In one chamber they discover a thick tome written in a variety of different scripts.  Gandalf reads through it slowly and discovers that most of the pages have been damaged, rendering the writing illegible.  However, he does make out some of the passages written by the dwarves Balin and Ori, their last words.  What were the last words Gandalf read in the book?", "correct": "They are coming", "options": ["We cannot get out", "The end comes", "We are doomed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are coming.\n\n\tIt is at this point that they discover the fate of Balin and company: they were all killed in battle with creatures of the deep.  Our friends are soon set upon by orcs and a cave troll, but manage to escape with minimal damage.  Their path leads them to the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm, where Gandalf will confront the Balrog. \n"}, {"text": "After exiting Moria sans Gandalf, the troupe parades toward the most beautiful forest of Middle Earth, Lothl\u00f3rien.  Legolas is excited; soon they will encounter his elven brethren and the resplendent lady Galadriel.  Meeting the elf Haldir, they are eventually allowed to pass into the home of the elves of L\u00f3rien, but with what requirement?", "correct": "Entry requires that the party be blindfolded", "options": ["All of their arms are to be confiscated by the elven guard", "Each party member must bow their heads upon entering the home of the elves", "They must remain silent until permission to speak is granted by the lady of the forest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEntry requires that the party be blindfolded.\n\n\tInitially, Haldir insists that Gimli not enter the forest, given the tense history of relations between elves and dwarves.  Later, he agrees that Gimli may enter, but that he must be blindfolded, something Gimli protests.  A solution is found when Aragorn suggests that the entire company be blindfolded on the way to the Naith of L\u00f3rien.  Gimli is the first to have his blindfold removed, and my goodness, is he pleased to see the beautiful Galadriel! \n"}, {"text": "While dwelling in L\u00f3rien, Frodo and friends meet not only Galadriel, the Lady of L\u00f3rien, but also the elf Lord of the wood.  What is the Lord's name?", "correct": "Celeborn", "options": ["Gildor", "Barahir", "Elendil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeleborn.\n\n\tUpon meeting our friendly itinerant group, Celeborn and Galadriel query them on their trek, and discover to their dismay that Gandalf has been lost to the Fellowship.  Celeborn indelicately blames the Dwarves for Gandalf's loss, they having delved too deep into the depths of the Earth, and this upsets Gimli.  Galadriel, though, is more conciliatory and understanding towards Gimli, and Gimli reciprocates (let's face it, Gimli is smitten with Galadriel!) \n"}, {"text": "One evening in the wood of L\u00f3rien, Galadriel allows some of the members to look upon the 'Mirror of Galadriel', a basin of water within which past, present, and future events are beheld.  Which Fellowship members are allowed to view the mirror?", "correct": "Sam and Frodo", "options": ["Frodo and Aragorn", "Frodo alone", "Aragorn and Boromir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam and Frodo.\n\n\tSam's wish to see some 'Elf-magic' comes to fruition as he beholds the apparent dismantling of the Shire.  This is Sam's baptism-by-fire with elven magic, and he doesn't like it!  Frodo sees Gandalf, garbed in white, and the battle of Gondor, both events of the distant future.  He also sees the Eye of Sauron, which Galadriel claims to see as well.  Poor Frodo has such a rough time in the first book! \n"}, {"text": "Leaving the wood, each of the members of the Fellowship is provided with a gift from the elves of L\u00f3rien.  What is the very special gift that Sam receives from Galadriel?", "correct": "Dirt", "options": ["Locks of Galadriel's hair", "Crystal phial", "Magic elven blade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDirt.\n\n\tSam's gift from Galadriel is very sweet, a wooden box filled with magic earth from her private garden.  Sam has but to sprinkle a bit on his own garden to create a wonderful crop each year.  Later, he finds a magic acorn buried in the dirt as well.  The magic phial of light is given to Frodo, while the gift of three hairs from the head of Galadriel is given to Gimli. \n"}, {"text": "The Company receives several general gifts from the elves, along with their personal gifts.  Elven cloaks that allow the wearers to become invisible against virtually any background are one of the special gifts, and several 'unsinkable' elven canoes are another.  Sam is delighted by the gift of a magic rope, woven by the Lady Galadriel herself.  Finally, some elven cakes are provided, which Gimli calls 'cram', after the crisp biscuits baked by the Dale-men.  What is the elven version of 'cram' called?\n", "correct": "Lembas", "options": ["Flet", "Alfirin", "Miruvor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLembas.\n\n\tThe 'lembas' provided by the elves of L\u00f3rien proves crucial throughout the rest of the story, especially for Sam and Frodo on their solo trek.  The canoes are used by the Company to ride the great Anduin river and the rope comes in handy later on, just as Sam predicted! \n"}, {"text": "As the Fellowship sets off along the Anduin River towards the mountains at Emyn Muil, Frodo and Sam converse about Sam's 'queer' dreams.  Specifically, Sam describes which of these things in his 'dream'?", "correct": "A log with eyes", "options": ["A talking tree", "A crawling rock", "A shaved monkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA log with eyes.\n\n\tThe 'log with eyes' turns out to be Gollum, who has been following the company since their trek took them deep into the abyssal depths of Moria.  Frodo also has espied Gollum along the way, and that evening he almost has a physical encounter with Gollum, chasing him off with Sting.  Something tells me though... that he'll be back! \n"}, {"text": "Further down the river the Fellowship catches sight of two great pillars of stone, the ancient kings of men, Isildur and An\u00e1rion.  Collectively, Aragorn refers to these great statues by which name?", "correct": "Argonath", "options": ["Valandil", "Elendil", "Elessar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArgonath.\n\n\t\"Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!\" cries Aragorn, \"Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and An\u00e1rion, my sires of old. Under their shadow, Elessar, the Elfstone, son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil, Isildur's son, heir of Elendil, has nought to dread!\"  I think the pillars, as they were rendered in the film, were perfectly awesome! \n"}, {"text": "When the company finally removes to land, Boromir betrays the cause by attempting to wrest the ring from Frodo's control.  Following this, Frodo realizes that he must finish the trek himself.  The rest of the party becomes suspicious due to Frodo's extended absence and goes to search for him.  Which of the company finds him first, after his confrontation with Boromir?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Aragorn", "Gimli", "Merry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tWith the company scattered, Sam very cleverly realizes that Frodo might go back for his gear and head towards the boats.  Sam's common sense proves valuable, and he is the first and only member of the group to discover Frodo's plan to leave.  Sam insists and is allowed to continue along with Frodo, and they leave the company without a word to any of the other members.  The Fellowship ends on this note, with the breaking up of the remaining eight.  Please keep your eyes out for my 'ultimate' quizzes on the 'Two Towers'... coming soon to a website near you! \n"}]}
