While many other series fell by the wayside after the reality TV boom at the start of the 2000s, \"Survivor\" maintained high ratings in part because each season would have different casts, different mechanics, and different twists; there would never be one single way to play the game, and from a social perspective, the experiment would always differ. \n"}, {"text": "David Haller is the titular superhero of what Marvel series first aired on FX in 2017?", "correct": "Legion", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLegion.\n\n\tLegion, the mutant son of Professor X, is followed in this unique series with a striking visual aesthetic evoking near-insanity.
