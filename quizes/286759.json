{"id": "286759", "name": "\"COTT\" - \"A Succumbing to Age Story\" Online Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Crash Bandicoot Games", "Crash of the Titans"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the first jackable creature you come to in this level?", "correct": "Goar", "options": ["Snipe", "Spike", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoar.\n\n\tThe Goar is a large creature.  It looks like an elephant, although it doesn't have a trunk.  It has four tusks, two sticking out the side and two in front.  Goar is meant to be Giant Boar combined to form Goar.  This Giant Boar is a very slow attacker, but jacking one can be very beneficial. \n"}, {"text": "What creature does the Snipe try to eat?", "correct": "Fox", "options": ["Coco", "Crash", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFox.\n\n\tWhen you first meet the Snipe, he is disguising himself as a purple plant.  An innocent fox gets near the Snipe, and the Snipe tries to eat it.  Luckily, you come in just in time to prevent the Snipe from eating the fox.  Once the Snipe lets go of the fox, the fox darts off.  You must now jack this Snipe. \n"}, {"text": "What must you do in the mojo room for this level?", "correct": "Destroy Bombs", "options": ["None of these", "Collect Mojo", "Destroy All Enemies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDestroy Bombs.\n\n\tYou do not need to collect mojo for this level, and you don't have to destroy all the enemies.  You must destroy a total of seven bombs to receive the mojo room voodoo doll.  Every level of the game has a mojo room, and they tend to increase in difficulty.  You will have various tasks from destroying bombs, collecting a certain amount of mojo, jacking your way to the top, and destroying all enemies. \n"}, {"text": "How many minions must you destroy in this level to get the minion master?", "correct": "Twenty-five", "options": ["Forty-five", "Sixty-five", "One hundred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwenty-five.\n\n\tThis level has you defeat a smaller number of minions than most levels, at only 25.  The minions you must defeat in this level are Ratnicians.  Jackable creatures do not count toward your minion master. \n"}, {"text": "Can you earn the Combo King on a single Snipe?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThe combo king is much too high to earn with a single Snipe.  Snipes will give you only about sixteen combo hits if you continuously whack it until it is dead. \n"}, {"text": "How many targets must you hit using your Snipe?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAlthough you can hit many Ratnicians and other objects, you only need to hit two actual targets.  Targets are usually red and white bullseyes, and most targets look old, and are starting to chip. \n"}, {"text": "What color is the color of every Goar?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Yellow", "None of these", "White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tGoars are some of the only creatures that don't change their appearance from each beast.  Stenches do not change at all, either.  Goars are always red.  Many change, like the Spike.  Spikes change from three different colors.  They can be two different shades of brown, and white. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a color of Snipe feathers?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Blue", "None of these", "Purple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tSnipes' feather colors can be only two different colors.  They can be blue, and they can be purple.  No Snipe will ever have red feathers. \n"}, {"text": "Here is a trickier question.  What color eyes to Goars have?", "correct": "white", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nwhite.\n\n\tGoars have white colored eyes.  Goars are jackable creatures, which means you are able to ride and control them.  Every jackable creature has a device somewhere on their body with a large \"N\" on it, to show it is a Neo/Nina Cortex creation.  You must put on the mask of Aku Aku to jack them.  This is done automatically when you click \"O.\" \n"}, {"text": "Are Snipes the only creature in this game to throw things?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tSnipes are not the only creature to throw things in this game, and not the only one who throws things as his main attack, either.  There are quite a number of creatures that can throw things, but only two creatures throw things as a main attack.  These creatures are the Snipe, who throw sharp feathers at you, and the Stench, who throw stink bombs at you. \n"}]}
