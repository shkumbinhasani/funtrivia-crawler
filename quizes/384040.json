{"id": "384040", "name": "\"Return to Roanoke\" (Chapter 6) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Roanoke"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the subtitle of \"My Roanoke Nightmare's\" sequel season?", "correct": "Three Days in Hell", "options": ["The Revival", "Second Harvest", "Blood Moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree Days in Hell.\n\n\t\"My Roanoke Nightmare\" was a major success upon its airing as a television documentary, and because of this, the network asked its creators to make a sequel series to capitalize on their gains.\r Sidney, the director of \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", rolls into a board meeting with the network executives with his camera in tow, asking them to sign release forms to have their faces shown on the footage.  This is the start of his next series.  People, he claim, are waiting to latch on to more Roanoke, so he's doing something 'familiar, but different'.  It's \"Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell\"; the actors from the show are brought together with the real people, and hidden cameras record their visit to the house in the show.  There's no reenacting; they live in the house over the period of the blood moon.\r The research department, however, was dissatisfied with the original ending of the show and the loose ends.  Sidney assuages their worries.  He'll find a way to get them all to the house which, he states, he bought from Matt Shelby for $0.50 when he started his documentary.\r They agree to thirteen episodes. \n"}, {"text": "Since the filming of \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", Matt and Shelby have done which of the following?", "correct": "Split up", "options": ["Had a baby", "Gone to prison", "Moved out of the country"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplit up.\n\n\tLeaving the boardroom, Sidney is elated with his continued success.  He runs into his right-hand-woman, Diana, outside and she worries about the show since the real Shelby Miller is refusing to return.\r Sidney and Diana head to Ojai, California ten weeks before they're scheduled to be on site at the Roanoke house.  They have an interview slated with Shelby who, in all fairness, is only going back in front of the camera to set the record straight about the misinformation being spread online about her time in the house.  People have, since the airing of \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", been sending her death threats.  She and Matt have since split; she was allegedly caught dating Dominic Banks, the man who portrayed Andre in the reenactment.  She refuses to comment.\r Shelby reveals that she will return to Roanoke because if she and Matt are locked in together, they'll be unable to avoid confronting their marital issues; he hasn't talked to her since the affair.  She says that Dominic can't be involved, however.  Sidney agrees, but Dominic is locked in as a cast member already. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Sidney set up the production trailers for \"Return to Roanoke\"?", "correct": "In the forest", "options": ["On the hillbilly farm", "In town", "In the driveway of the Roanoke house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the forest.\n\n\tTwo weeks before the blood moon, Sidney and Diana assist production in setting up the cameras and what-have-you in the actual house.  One of Sidney's workers gives them a run-through of all the unique 'tricks' that they'll have up their sleeve during production from special effects in the kitchen to video recordings of Elias' tape on the TV in the living room.\r Diana takes Sidney aside to express her concerns.  One reason why the show was so popular was because of how real it all seemed, and having pop-up scares won't help.  Sidney explains that the reality of it all will come from the cast's interactions in the house twenty-four hours a day, and hopefully it will spur a confession from Lee.\r Sidney also has production move their trailers a half mile down the road, into the forest, to ensure that immersion is kept as deep as possible for those who'll be living in the house.\r Sidney and Diana are called aside by a member of their crew.  Someone not in the production team has set up a ring of rotting fetal pigs next to a tree outside the house, and it couldn't have been the Polks; they haven't been seen for weeks. \n"}, {"text": "The woman who played which character in \"My Roanoke Nightmare\" is barred from the set of \"Return to Roanoke\" by a restraining order?", "correct": "The Butcher", "options": ["Scathach", "Shelby Miller", "Lee Harris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Butcher.\n\n\tAgnes Mary Winstead, who played the role of The Butcher in \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", sits for her interview with Sidney and she explains that it's been a wild ride since the show, at least for her, since the role seemed to resonate with her from the get-go.  She was even nominated for a Saturn Award for her nuanced portrayal.  Agnes doesn't see The Butcher as a villain though; she says it was a privilege to breathe life in such a noble historical figure.\r That said, it took a toll on her.  Shortly after the release of \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", Agnes was arrested in Hollywood for assault with a deadly weapon and was placed into an institution for six months, having been diagnosed with schizo-effective disorder.  She became obsessed with her role and even moved to North Carolina to be closer to Roanoke.\r Sidney believes that she placed the ring of fetal pigs at the Roanoke house, but she insists that she knows nothing about it.  She claims she's better, but Sidney informs her that she will not be a part of the second season.  In fact, she has a restraining order placed on her, barring her from being anywhere near production.  She doesn't take kindly to this idea. \n"}, {"text": "Monet Tumusiime, who portrayed Lee in \"My Roanoke Nightmare\", is revealed to be addicted to which of these?", "correct": "Alcohol", "options": ["Gambling", "Bath salts", "Heroin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlcohol.\n\n\tLee Harris ends up filming an interview with \"E! News'\" Kristen Dos Santos about her involvement in \"Return to Roanoke\" though it's a bit unclear as to whether or not she's guilty of murdering Mason.  She has, since leaving the house however, been signed on for a seven-figure book deal.\r Sidney worries that Lee is a dangerous person and could kill again if placed into the house.  The executives are actually more concerned with Monet Tumusiime, the woman who portrayed Lee in \"My Roanoke Nightmare\" since, as an alcoholic, they can't knowingly give her alcohol.\r Diana gets a call from production; there's been a problem at the house.  They arrive to find an ambulance at the set.  Someone, using a chainsaw to chop wood nearby, ended up decapitated in a horrific accident.  Sidney decides to keep production going.  Planes are landing in four hours.  \r Diana, disgusted by Sidney's decision, decides to leave immediately, angrily driving off down the laneway.  She records her departure as proof of what's happening on-set, but as she drives she comes across someone standing in the distance.  She decides not to stop to see who it is, but as she continues to depart, something wearing the head of a pig attacks her from the back seat.  Footage from her dashcam is found three months later by police officers.  Her body is not. \n"}, {"text": "Between seasons of the show, Audrey Tindall, who portrayed Shelby, married the actor playing which role?", "correct": "Edward Mott", "options": ["Dr. Elias Cunningham", "Matt Miller", "Ambrose White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward Mott.\n\n\tBritish actress Audrey Tindall has her first confessional for \"Return to Roanoke\" and expresses her excitement about the new season.  She also reveals that she and the actor playing Edward Mott have gotten married since filming ended, having met during the reenactments and built up their love.\r Rory and Audrey are the first to arrive at the Roanoke house for \"Return to Roanoke\" and they claim the master bedroom.  Before anything can happen though, Rory receives a call.  He's been asked to do a screen test in Los Angeles for Brad Pitt's new movie.  In her confessional, Audrey appears a bit worried. \n"}, {"text": "Audrey and Rory, while walking through the house, believe they encounter a ghost.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHeading through the house, Audrey tells Rory that he should tell Sidney about the screen test and fly to Los Angeles to pursue the new role.  They find themselves interrupted, however, when walking through the dining room because Rory sees someone stalk past the window.  Checking the next window, it appears that Agnes is breaking in; she smashes the window.\r Audrey and Rory head to the front door, but Sidney has arrived with Monet and Shelby.  Audrey is more than worried.  Months earlier, Agnes visited her apartment with a large knife, possibly because she won the Saturn Award over her colleague.  Sidney confirms that they found no sign of anyone on the grounds. \n"}, {"text": "Sidney, in an attempt to aid production, takes away the phones of his \"Return to Roanoke\" cast members.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAlthough Audrey is taken aback by the events already occurring in the house, Shelby takes the time to congratulate her and Rory on their marriage (while Monet searches the bar).  It's not long, however, before Lee and Matt arrive, clearly apprehensive.\r Sidney gives all six of the cast members who have arrived new phones (while taking their old ones away) explaining that he wants them all to document the events as they transpire.  Their new phones won't phone out, but they will film everything.  The reenactors quickly make use of the devices as the Millers have a bit of a fight over their proposed living arrangements, particularly because Matt and Shelby are expected to share a room. \n"}, {"text": "According to subtitles provided by the show, how many people on the cast survived filming of \"Return to Roanoke\"?", "correct": "One & 1", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne & 1.\n\n\tAudrey, Rory, and Monet end up in the kitchen where they discuss how silly everything is.  The stories about the house, for instance, can't be real if they're all there during the blood moon.  Matt comes in to show them that it's almost that time; the blood moon is almost full, and will be by the next night.\r Over the next three days, during the blood moon, every participant in the series died under mysterious circumstances except for one.\r The show was never expected to be aired on account of the grisly deaths that were captured on film.  The footage of \"Return to Roanoke\" has been assembled by what has been found after the fact. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first to be killed in \"Return to Roanoke\"?", "correct": "Rory", "options": ["Lee", "Dominic", "Monet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRory.\n\n\tRory and Audrey end up in the hot tub outside, filming their romantic ventures.  In her room, Monet pours herself some smuggled vodka.  Matt settles into the basement.  Lee, walking through the front hall, doesn't notice the figure stalking behind her, passing in front of the camera.\r Audrey heads upstairs while Shelby tries to avoid Lee in the kitchen, heading down to see Matt in the basement and to convince him to come upstairs.  Lee ends up in the kitchen with Monet who, angrily, says she only started drinking after she had to live in her head for months during the portrayal.\r Shelby is the one to get the front door when it knocks.  It's Dominic.  Matt ends up fighting him immediately, breaking into a physical altercation the moment he steps through the front door.\r Audrey takes a shower and hears the door to the bathroom open behind her, believing it to be Rory.  When she steps out of the shower though, it's not him.  In the mirror, she sees the figure wearing the pig's head.  She gets out of the bathroom and races downstairs to the safety of her reenactor companions.  When Rory checks upstairs, he scans through every room.  He finds nothing...  instead, the nurses find him.  Two woman in nurse's outfits slit his throat and stab him to death as he checks inside a closet.\r Down in the dining room, Matt sees the word MURDER in blood on the wall; the nurses have used Rory as their final 'R'.  He tells the others...'R' is for Rory. \n"}]}
