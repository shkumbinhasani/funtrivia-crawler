{"id": "202816", "name": "Fractured American Idol 2005 Trivia Quiz | Fractured TV | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Wordplay", "Fractured TV"], "questions": [{"text": "Hullo homey show?", "correct": "Aloha Mischeaux", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAloha Mischeaux.\n\n\tAloha usually wore a flower in her hair. Nineteen during the competition, she's from St. Louis, Missouri. Aloha is a gutsy singer who seems very comfortable onstage ala Fantasia Barrino. She's a pretty good comedienne, too. She was one of my favorites to win. For some unfathomable reason, \"America\" voted her out before the Top 12 were picked. \n"}, {"text": "Naughty your torn her?", "correct": "Nadia Turner", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNadia Turner.\n\n\tBeautiful Nadia is from Miami, Florida. She was 28 during competition time. She could sing anything it seemed, from rock to soul to Paul McCartney ballads. She was also one of my favorites. She was the sixth to go. In my opinion, she shouldn't have been voted out so soon. \n"}, {"text": "Beau bites?", "correct": "Bo Bice", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBo Bice.\n\n\tOne of the two rockers in the competition (Constantine was the other), Bo--29 at competition time--is from Helena, Alabama. He's a confident, fabulous performer with a big, rich voice. Another favorite of mine. He came in second, and he's sure to go far. \n"}, {"text": "Anthem knee fetter off?", "correct": "Anthony Fedorov & Anthony Federov", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnthony Fedorov & Anthony Federov.\n\n\tNineteen at competition time (he turned 20 on the day he made the Top 4), Anthony is originally from Ukraine. He has a Clay Aiken-style voice and slightly nerdy manner. His is a fairytale success story, since he had a tracheotomy when he was a child. Recovering from the illness that made this necessary, he learned to speak and sing--quite well, too. But, in my humble opinion, he deserved to leave before Nikko, Nadia, Anwar, and Constantine did. He was the ninth to go--so he made the Top 4, but not the Top 3. \n"}, {"text": "Fond cell solemn men?", "correct": "Vonzell Solomon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVonzell Solomon.\n\n\tThe lovely Vonzell, twenty in early 2005, is from Fort Myers, Florida. She's a former mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service. Gospel is her favorite musical style. She's comfortable with an audience and seems like an all-around nice girl. Another favorite of mine. She came in third--she's wonderful! \n"}, {"text": "Linseed garden Nelly?", "correct": "Lindsey Cardinale", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLindsey Cardinale.\n\n\tPretty Lindsey, twenty at the time, is from Ponchatoula, Louisiana. She loves country music. I thought she was a fairly good singer, but I didn't expect to see her in the Top 12--too many topknotch performers in 2005--but she made it after all. However, she was the first to be voted out. She gave a spunky, graceful farewell performance. \n"}, {"text": "Merry owe vast quiz?", "correct": "Mario Vazquez & Mario Vasquez", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMario Vazquez & Mario Vasquez.\n\n\tMario, 27 at the time, is from New York City. He's a dreamboat and sings beautifully. I thought there was a good chance that Mario would win, or at least be in the Top 3. I was flabbergasted when he quit on March 13, but I was also happy for Nikko Smith, who truly deserved a slot in the Top 12. Rumor had it that Mario quit because he didn't want to be tied down to Simon Cowell's recording contract. \n"}, {"text": "Yes sick gushy era?", "correct": "Jessica Sierra", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJessica Sierra.\n\n\tJessica, 19 at competition time, is from Tampa, Florida. She has a strong, deep, sexy voice. Jessica was the third contestant (and the third woman) to leave the Top 12. \n"}, {"text": "Gone stunt teen maroon less?", "correct": "Constantine Maroulis", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nConstantine Maroulis.\n\n\tAnother 29-year-old rocker like Bo Bice, he's from New York City like Mario Vazquez. But he's got his own sexy, slinky style. Constantine loves Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin--and it showed during the competition. I thought that Bo's screams ala John Lennon/Janis Joplin were a bit better than Constantine's, though. He was the seventh to go--and, in my opionion, he's a MUCH better performer than either Anthony or Scott. But so it goes. \n"}, {"text": "Curry yonder would?", "correct": "Carrie Underwood", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarrie Underwood.\n\n\tKnown as \"Farm Girl,\" Carrie was 21 during the competition. She's from Checotah, Oklahoma. She has a gorgeous country-style voice, but she can sing anything. She was a favorite of mine, too. On May 25, 2005, she became the fourth American Idol, joining Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, and Fantasia Barrino. Congratulations, Carrie! \n"}, {"text": "Anne wore Robyn's sun?", "correct": "Anwar Robinson", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnwar Robinson.\n\n\tTwenty-five at the time, Anwar seemed like the nicest guy! He was a middle school music teacher from East Orange, New Jersey. One of the judges said he has the best-trained voice among the Top 20 contestants. He and Nikko were my favorite men among the competitors. In my opinion, \"America\" was wrong to vote him off the show before contestants such as Anthony and Scott. Sadly, he was the fifth to go. \n"}, {"text": "Muck gale law gore dawn?", "correct": "Mikalah Gordon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMikalah Gordon.\n\n\tOnly 17 at competition time, Mikalah seemed like a young Barbra Streisand. She's from Las Vegas, Nevada. She's lively and sassy, and she talks a mile a minute. She could go far as a Broadway musical comedy star or a sitcom actress, I thought. She was the second Top 12 contestant to leave. She, too, gave a graceful, spirited farewell performance. \n"}, {"text": "Knee goes myth?", "correct": "Nikko Smith", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNikko Smith.\n\n\tFrom Town and Country, Missouri, 22 at the time, Nikko is handsome, cool, and very talented. His dad is Baseball Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith. Nikko never meant to audition for AI--he accompanied a girlfriend there to provide moral support. She wasn't picked for Hollywood, but he was! He and Anwar were my favorite men in the competition. I was very sad when Nikko was passed over for the Top 12, and thrilled when Mario's withdrawal reinstated Nikko. And sad again when Nikko was the fourth to leave the Top 12. (In my opinion, shoulda been Anthony--Nikko can sing circles around him!) \n"}, {"text": "Caught sable?", "correct": "Scott Savol", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nScott Savol.\n\n\tFollowing the Ruben Studdard tradition of big guys with big, beautiful voices, Scott is from Shaker Heights, Ohio. He was 28 at competition time, and he's the proud dad of a young son. He's unhappy about being overweight, so I hoped that this competition would make him successful enough to hire a personal trainer. It was fantastic to see him make the Top 12, and I hoped he would make the Top 3. He didn't, though he made the Top 5. Scott was the eighth to leave the Top 12. \n"}, {"text": "Drabbest talker?", "correct": "Travis Tucker", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTravis Tucker.\n\n\tTravis, from Manassas, Virginia, was 21 in early 2005. He's a likeable guy and a great performer--singing and dancing for an audience seemed to make him glow with happiness. He started an a cappella singing group at his university in Virginia. Sadly, he didn't make the Top 12.\r So that's \"A mirror kin Nytol\" 2005 with your host, Wry yen secrets and AI's three celebrity judges: Polyp duel, Grandee shack sewn, and Sigh moan growl! Enjoy! And thanks for taking the quiz. P.S. Just for the record I want to state that I think it was a mistake to pick equal numbers of girls and boys--as it happened, the guys (as a group) were better than the women this year.\r If you'd like to send opinions on the contestants or the whole Poll lob dual/Curry clerk controversy, I will add them to the quiz. \n"}]}
