After she has made her report and is about to leave, one of the police constables follows her out and returns which protective item that she had left inside?", "correct": "Umbrella", "options": ["Raincoat", "Bonnet", "Spats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUmbrella.\n\n\tMrs Wilberforce has a reputation with the local constabulary for reporting fanciful incidents.  It is this trait that has made her such an attractive proposition for the gang of robbers; Professor Marcus already knows that the local police humour her and take little that she says to them seriously.  However, this trait also stands Mrs Wilberforce in good stead at the end of this humorous tale. As for the umbrella; Mrs Wilberforce is always forgetting about it and leaving it somewhere; \"I'm always leaving it, I don't like it very much really, maybe that's the reason\", she says to the Police Superintendent at her local station as she leaves. \n"}, {"text": "General Gordon is the name of one of Mrs Wilberforce's beloved pets. What sort of creature is General Gordon?", "correct": "Parrot", "options": ["Dog ", "Cat", "Guinea Pig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParrot.\n\n\tGeneral Gordon is one of three birds owned by Mrs Wilberforce; two parrots and a Cockatoo.  Unfortunately General Gordon, an Ecuadorian Amazon parrot, is unwell and requires medicine.  This leads to a particularly humorous scene in which Harry Robinson, played by Peter sellers, tries to help but is severely pecked by the parrot which, by this time, has found a perch on top of a sideboard in Mrs Wilberforce's sitting room.  Retired boxer, One-Round Lawson, played by Danny Green, attempts to retrieve the parrot from the top of the sideboard by standing on a chair which, unsurprisingly, collapses under him trapping his lower legs; slapstick comedy at its absolute best!  \rFor those of you interested, the second parrot, an African Grey, was named Admiral Beatty and the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is named Milton. \n"}, {"text": "Masquerading as a musical group, the gang meet at Mrs Wilberforce's to plan their heist.  In an effort to disguise their true intentions, they play a record which Mrs Wilberforce believes that they are actually playing.  From the pen of which 18th Century Italian composer was music being played whilst the gang hatched their plan?", "correct": "Boccherini", "options": ["Bach", "Handel", "Wagner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoccherini.\n\n\tMrs Wilberforce's father had engaged a string quintet to play at her 21st birthday party; it brought back sad memories for Mrs Wilberforce as whilst the minuet from Boccherini's 'String Quintet in E' was played it was announced that the old Queen, Queen Victoria had died and that the news had brought an end to her party.  Ridolfo Luigi Boccherini was born in Lucca, Italy on the 19th of February 1743 and died in Madrid, Spain on the 28th of May 1805.  Boccherini was originally interred in Madrid but in 1927 the Italian leader, Benito Mussolini had his remains returned to his birthplace. \n"}, {"text": "Danny Green, who played the part of retired boxer and the gang's muscleman, has which nickname?", "correct": "One-Round", "options": ["Baggy-Pants", "Dredd", "Goldilocks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne-Round.\n\n\tOne-Round Lawson was portrayed as a slow, dim-witted hard man with a soft side to his nature.

On arrival it is loaded onto a barrow by Harry Robinson who is disguised as a railway porter.  The trunk is transported across the station and smuggled into an area containing incoming baggage; the police immediately make their way to the area where outgoing luggage was being held as they expect the stolen cash to be spirited away from London. Mrs Wilberforce, who has been asked to collect Professor Marcus' trunk, the one now containing the stolen money, arrives at King's Cross and signs for the trunk in the presence of two plain-clothed detectives. She then has the trunk loaded back into a taxi for the journey back to her home.

During an early scene in which Professor Marcus has arrived to look at the rooms available for rent, he attempts to straighten a crooked picture hanging on the wall in Mrs Wilberforce's hallway; which promptly swings out of plumb as soon as he removes his hand.  The entire building is lopsided; \"A lopsided grandma living in a lopsided house\"; and it is for this reason that Mrs Wilberforce is given this nickname by Louis Harvey. \n"}, {"text": "In which musical instrument case do the gang hide the greater part of the proceeds of their robbery, prior to making their escape from Mrs Wilberforce's house?", "correct": "Cello", "options": ["Bass", "Flute", "Violin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCello.\n\n\tAfter the gang have removed the proceeds of the robbery from the strong-boxes in which it was contained, they place it inside One-Round's cello case.  Unfortunately for the gang, as they are waiting in their car to make their getaway, One-Round closes the door to Mrs Wilberforce's house on its carrying strap. Rather than ask Mrs Wilberforce to open the door in order that he can release it, he decides to pull at the case which results in it flying open and the money spilling out onto the pavement; with this the door opens and we see Mrs Wilberforce standing there looking down at him, having finally realised that the musical group are not what they seemed! \n"}, {"text": "When the gang eventually conclude that they must dispatch the meddling Mrs Wilberforce, the gang draw lots to decide who will dispatch her.

Once the remaining members of the gang have realised what has happened the vicious Louis Harvey pursues the Major up onto the roof ridge. As the major tries to escape he falls, along with a heavy chimney pot and is killed.  When Professor Marcus asks what has happened to the major, he is told by Harry Robinson that \"He come down... with the chimney pot\".
