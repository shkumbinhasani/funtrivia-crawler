Who wrote the novel?", "correct": "Tom Wolfe", "options": ["Danielle Steele", "Robert Ludlum", "Anne Rice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom Wolfe.\n\n\tPopular writer Tom Wolfe wrote a popular novel ... but the critics hated the movie and it died at the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Hanks starred with a legendary comedian in \"Nothing in Common\".
