{"id": "346802", "name": "Hard Survivor: The Australian Outback Quiz / Test | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Survivor", "Survivor: The Outback"], "questions": [{"text": "In this season of \"Survivor\", the two original teams were 'Ogakor' and which of these other options?", "correct": "Kucha", "options": ["Pagong", "Gitanos", "Samburu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKucha.\n\n\tOn Day 1, a plane dropped down on a remote runway in the Australian Outback.  It contained a total of sixteen people.  Wearing blue, the Kucha tribe contained contain eight; wearing green, the Ogakor tribe also contained eight members.  As soon as the plane departed, teams needed to open survival crates left for them and, in five minutes, gather everything they could carry and trek five miles through the wilderness to their camps, both in opposite directions.  The camps were four miles apart and each featured their flag and a canoe.\r'Kucha' is an Australian aboriginal word for 'kangaroo' and 'Ogakor' means 'crocodile'.  Both were encountered during the teams' forty-two days in the wilderness. \n"}, {"text": "Colby's luxury item proved to be useful for his team.  This particular item indicated that he lived in which American state?", "correct": "Texas", "options": ["New York", "Louisiana", "Washington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTexas.\n\n\tThis season was the first to make a prominent featuring of several luxury items brought by survivors into the game.  Colby's Texan flag, for example, was admittedly brought along to be used as a shelter.  It was used as a tent from the very first day.  Late in the game, while bartering for more rice, the merged team needed to give up their flag to receive food.\rOther interesting items included Rodger's Bible (containing letters from his family), Keith's paella pan, Jerri's bongo drum and Jeff's colouring book.  Jeff's luxury item was coloured in by the other survivors and signed before being sold on eBay for charity. \n"}, {"text": "After Day 10, teams experienced the threat of which natural disaster first-hand?", "correct": "Wildfires", "options": ["Earthquakes", "Droughts", "Monsoons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWildfires.\n\n\tAlthough the survivors arrived during the rainy season, production of the show was threatened by a series of wildfires skirting the filming locations for both main camps.  While many tribe members were worried about the possibility of wildfire movement after the first week and the possibility of migration, it did force local animals to move closer to the tribes.  As a result, the Kucha tribe was able to catch and eat a pig.\rAside from the smoke and ash of the wildfires, teams were also plagued by rain on occasion, creating horrible nights of sleep and risking the loss of their fire. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 18, which tribe member was evacuated and removed from the competition?", "correct": "Mike", "options": ["Kimmi", "Rodger", "Mitchell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike.\n\n\tPrior to the Immunity Challenge on Day 18, Kucha experienced a surprising turn of events when one of their strongest members, Mike, fell unconscious into the fire pit, burning himself and needing to be rushed out of the Outback.  As a result of his immediate expulsion from the game, both teams became even with five members on each.  This was the first time that any Survivor contestant had been removed from the game for emergency or medical reasons.  Ultimately, this had a major impact on the game-- the merger occurred a day later.  The final team Immunity Challenge was cancelled. \n"}, {"text": "When the teams merged on Day 20, they took on what new name, also the name of a river fish?", "correct": "Barramundi", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarramundi.\n\n\tOn Day 19, Kucha received a 'Girls' Night Out' message while Ogakor received one for the men.  Elizabeth and Alicia joined the girls at Ogakor Beach while Keith and Colby headed to Kucha's camp.  They arrived and spent the night sharing food and investigating each others' camps in preparation for the merger.  On Day 20 it turned out that no choices needed to be made at all; in fifteen minutes, teams needed to gather everything they needed from their camps and head to a new beach marked with their new flag; the name they chose was 'Barramundi' and their team colour was orange. \n"}, {"text": "How many Tribal Council ceremonies contained tie votes?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe first tie vote occurred within the Ogakor tribe during their third Tribal Council ceremony.  After three votes for Keith and three votes for Mitchell, the two pleaded their case (though Mitchell actually announced his defeat and virtual resignation) and the vote was recast; this resulted in another tie.  According to \"Survivor\" rules, the person voted out would be the one with the most prior votes.  Since Mitchell already had a vote to his name, he was eliminated.\rThe second tie occurred after the merger, between Colby and Jeff, split along team lines.  This too went into deadlock, resulting in Jeff's elimination due to two earlier votes cast against him. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 28, the merged tribe experienced the first ever \"Survivor\" auction.  Which of these was not an item bid on during the event?", "correct": "Popcorn", "options": ["Mountain Dew", "Peanut butter and chocolate", "Four Doritos and salsa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPopcorn.\n\n\tIn place of the normal Reward Challenge posed for teams at the beginning of their three week cycle, the remaining seven tribe members of the Barramundi tribe headed to the first-ever \"Survivor\" auction to bid on different items.  Everyone had $500 (AUS) and needed to bid.  While some items seemed meager at first (eg. four Doritos and salsa, four squares of chocolate and peanut butter, a can of Mountain Dew, etc.), later prizes like a cheeseburger and a meal of mashed potatoes, bread, vegetables and turkey, were much treasured.  Some items hidden in mystery boxes ended up being duds-- a glass of river water, for instance.\rThis opposed the second Immunity Challenge of the game involving bush tucker such as mangrove worms, cow brain, mudwell, witchitigrub larva, bugs with pincers, and tripe. \n"}, {"text": "On Day 31, the merged tribe encountered which of these disasters?", "correct": "Their camp was flooded", "options": ["Their food was eaten by crocodiles", "Their tent was struck by lightning", "Their beach turned out to be a locust breeding ground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir camp was flooded.\n\n\tReturning from a Reward Challenge on Day 31, the Barramundi tribe was shocked to find that their camp, constructed in the middle of a dry creek bed, had flooded in their absence, washing away their encampment, their food, and their supplies.  This was one of the final major natural disasters to affect the group before their final week in the Outback.  The final six members of the tribe had to make do with what they could salvage to rough it out for the remaining days.  At this point, there were only six tribe members remaining. \n"}, {"text": "The reward for the final Reward Challenge of the competition (during the final four) was which of these?", "correct": "A car", "options": ["The immunity talisman", "A phone call home", "A full meal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA car.\n\n\tWith tribe members dwindling in their last nine days in Australia, the rewards became greater and greater.  For the penultimate reward challenge, the final five headed out to perform internet chats with their loved ones.  To win this reward, teams needed to answer questions with their loved ones to win a thirty-minute chat.\rFor the final reward challenge for the final four survivors, the tribe members competed in an obstacle course comprised of different structures from throughout the previous thirty-nine days.  The winner, Colby, won a Pontiac Aztec. \n"}, {"text": "Which tribe member ultimately became the Sole Survivor of this season?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Colby", "Keith", "Elizabeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tThe final Tribal Council pitted Colby and Tina, both originally Ogakor members, against each other for the $1,000,000 prize.  When it came down to the seven jury members, Colby received votes from Rodger, Nick, and Amber; Tina ended up winning the title of Sole Survivor with four votes, one each cast from Elizabeth, K eith, Jerri, and Alicia.  This made Tina the first female winner of \"Survivor\" and the second million-dollar winner overall.  Other than Mike, who was removed from the game, Tina was the only person in this season of \"Survivor\" never to receive a vote against her. \n"}]}
