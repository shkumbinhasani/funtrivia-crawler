{"id": "406351", "name": "How Sweet It Is! (Making Maple Syrup) Trivia Quiz | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink"], "questions": [{"text": "The area where a large group of maple trees grow that are used for syrup production is called a \"sugarbush\". How old must the trees in the sugarbush be to be tapped for maple syrup making? (Think twoscore)", "correct": "At least 40 years old", "options": ["At least 4 years old", "It doesn't matter", "At least 100 years old"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt least 40 years old.\n\n\tThe farmers make wood roads into the forest where there is the heaviest concentration of mature sugar maple trees. Other species are cleared out to make more room for the maples to grow. Trees must be at least 40 years old to be used without damaging the tree. \n"}, {"text": "When the water, stored in the tree's roots, combine with natural sugar that is in the tree, what is created? ", "correct": "Sap", "options": ["Maple juice", "Syrup", "Sugar jam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSap.\n\n\tOn a warm day the water flows up from the roots and mixes with the natural sugar to produce sap. Sap is a clear liquid that is between 2% to 5% natural sugar.  Typical sugar weather causes a freeze at night and a thaw during the next day that causes the sap to be pushed out the sap hole into a bucket. \n"}, {"text": "The maple sugar season is about six weeks long. When does it usually start?", "correct": "Late February or early March", "options": ["Late September early October", "Around Christmas", "During the month of June"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLate February or early March.\n\n\tFor successful sap gathering, warm days and cold nights are needed. When the weather begins to get warmer, farmers drill tap holes into the trees. Once the hole is drilled and the shavings are brushed out a spout is inserted so the sap can begin flowing out. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these are used to collect sap to make maple syrup?", "correct": "Either a metal sap bucket or a plastic tube", "options": ["A plastic trash bag that is attached to the spout with a rubber band", "A granite cistern that is placed on the ground at the base of the tree", "The sap flows into the back of a tin-lined wagon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEither a metal sap bucket or a plastic tube.\n\n\tAfter the spout is inserted into the tree, a 16-quart bucket with a lid to keep out rain and snow is attached to the tree. A newer way developed to collect sap is the use of plastic tubing. Plastic spouts are driven into the tree and plastic tubing is attached to the spout. The sap runs down a hill in the tube and is collected in a large tub at the bottom. In the correct topography up to 100 trees can be connected. \n"}, {"text": "How often must the sap be collected during maple sugar season?", "correct": "Every day", "options": ["At the end of the six-week season", "Once a week", "Whenever the bucket becomes full"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvery day.\n\n\tThe sap must be collected daily because it remains perishable until it is boiled. The sugar maker usually goes out with a sled or wagon pulled by horses or a tractor, collects the sap from each tree by putting it in a collection pail and then pouring the sap into a gathering tank in the back of the wagon/sled. Typically, it would take a team of four people eight hours to collect about 1,200 buckets. If plastic tubing is used the sap is pumped from the collection tubs once a day. \n"}, {"text": "On average, it takes about 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe amount of sap needed varies depending on its sugar content. Some sugar makers use the Rule of 86, which states that one gallon of syrup is equal to 86 gallons divided by the percent of sugar in the sap. Since the sap collected from the trees is usually around 2-4 %, it is estimated that it takes roughly 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup. \n"}, {"text": "What is the structure called where the sap is boiled down into syrup? ", "correct": "Sugarhouse", "options": ["Sap Room", "Syrup Laboratory", "Boiling Barn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSugarhouse.\n\n\tThe sugarhouse contains the evaporator (a large pan and fire box used to boil the sap down into syrup) and a woodshed where 25-30 cords of wood are stacked for fuel. The wood has been dried for a year. During the sugar season workers spend most of their time in the sugarhouse. Meals are eaten there, and neighbors and friends often stop by to visit because the one doing the boiling cannot leave his post. \n"}, {"text": "Why does a sugar maker use a thermometer and hydrometer in the syrup making process?", "correct": "To know when the syrup has reached the correct thickness", "options": ["To see if more wood should be added to the fire", "To check the sweetness of the syrup", "To check the depth of the sap in the evaporator pan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo know when the syrup has reached the correct thickness.\n\n\tThe evaporator is divided into two pans. The sap enters the pan at about 2-4% sugar. When enough water has been boiled away that the liquid is now at 7% sugar, it flows into another pan where it thickens. The sugar maker uses the thermometer to check the temperature and hydrometer (to check the density) to make sure the thickness of the syrup complies with state standards. Maple syrup is considered syrup at 219 degrees Fahrenheit. \n"}, {"text": "How often can a maple tree be tapped for sap collection?", "correct": "The tree can be tapped each year", "options": ["The tree can be tapped every week during sugar season", "There is no limit on how often you can tap a tree", "The tree can only be tapped once every five years"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe tree can be tapped each year.\n\n\tA tree can be tapped each year without damaging the tree. However, a new hole must be drilled at least six inches from the previous year's hole. The sugaring process takes only about seven percent of the sap, so the tree is not harmed. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a good use for maple syrup?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Put it on pancakes or waffles", "Use as a substitute for granulated sugar", "Use to make glazes or barbecue sauce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tMaple syrup has many table uses (pancakes, waffles, French toast, hot cereal, etc.) as well as cooking uses (making glazes, sauces, making pies, etc.). While in Vermont I even had maple syrup on a slice of pizza! (It was delicious.) If substituting syrup for granulated sugar, use three quarters of a cup of syrup for one cup of sugar and cut back on the amount of liquid in the recipe. I hope you enjoyed this quiz. \n"}]}
