{"id": "245618", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'For the Good of the Outfit' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "In the O.R., the doctors at the 4077th suddenly find themselves operating on locals, including women and children.  It turns out that a nearby village called Tai Dong has been bombed, and possibly by American forces.  Which of the doctors comments that he had recently visited Tai Dong and saw no enemy artillery there?", "correct": "Trapper", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Henry", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrapper.\n\n\tMargaret mentions that Tai Dong was shelled that morning, which prompts Trapper's comments.  An irked Frank Burns shouts, 'I insist on quiet in here.'  Trapper responds, 'Will someone please turn the war down for Frank.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper decide to look into the situation a little more, suspecting that Tai Dong might have been shelled by U.S. forces.  Sure enough, Trapper discovers that the shell fragments they have dislodged from their patients 'are as American as apple pie and ________.' ", "correct": "Napalm", "options": ["Ham sandwiches", "Atom bombs", "Heart attacks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNapalm.\n\n\tNow, Hawkeye and Trapper have the physical evidence they need to move forward with their investigation.  Unfortunately, Henry wants nothing to do with it, stating, 'I just want to remind you how thrilled the army is about people who rock the boat.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Trapper want to enlist Frank's help, but the latter is very resistant to participating, largely because of all the practical jokes the two doctors have pulled on him lately.  For example, what 'autographed message' have they written on Frank's mother's photo?", "correct": "Dear Frank, Dad was not your father.  Love, mom", "options": ["Dear Frank, You were adopted. Love, mom", "Dear Frank, Please send money. Love, mom", "Dear Frank, Your real name is Herbert. Love, mom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDear Frank, Dad was not your father.  Love, mom\n\n\tAmong the other practical jokes recently pulled on Frank include peanut butter in his stethoscope and ether in his aftershave.  The Swamp rats can be truly cruel to Frank! \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the officer who is sent to the 4077th from the inspector general's office to investigate the Tai Dong incident?", "correct": "Major Stoner", "options": ["Colonel Torkelson", "Captain Quimby", "Lieutenant Appleby"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMajor Stoner.\n\n\tMajor Stoner, played by character actor Frank Aletter, serves as an adjutant inspector general at the inspector general's office.  He appears to be very interested in moving the investigation along, but later we learn that he has assisted in whitewashing the whole affair.  He is eventually reassigned to COMSERVPAC in Honolulu, according to General Clayton. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not included in the package Hawkeye delivers to the adjutant inspector general in the hope that the investigation will be facilitated?", "correct": "Signed affidavits from the local victims", "options": ["Shell fragments", "Complete medical profiles", "X-rays"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSigned affidavits from the local victims.\n\n\tHawkeye is very thorough, and rather naive, in this situation.  He believe that he has an open and shut case, but he is to be disturbed by the results.  When he delivers the package to Major Stoner, Stoner suggests that Hawkeye may receive a commendation. \n"}, {"text": "Does Frank ever offer to become a co-signer of the report that Hawkeye and Trapper have submitted regarding the Tai Dong incident?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tInitially, Frank declines, not wanting to 'rock the boat', as he views it.  Later, when it becomes clear that there could be commendations for those involved in the investigation, he becomes eager to sign.  It's too late, however, as Major Stoner has already processed the report.  Margaret is incensed that Hawkeye and Trapper have stolen Frank's glory, to which Hawkeye responds that 'we begged him to do the decent thing'.  Frank's response, 'Well how do I know what the decent thing is?' \n"}, {"text": "Much to their chagrin, Hawkeye and Trapper learn that the U.S. has claimed no responsibility for the attack on Tai Dong.  Rather, the enemy has been blamed.  How do they discover this?", "correct": "Reading 'Stars and Stripes'", "options": ["From Major Stoner", "Radar hears it through channels", "The locals inform them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReading 'Stars and Stripes'.\n\n\tTrapper reads the following: 'Tai Dong shelled: The Army revealed that the South Korean village of Tai Dong sustained damage and casualties as a result of enemy artillery attack.'  Hawkeye responds, 'Now we know how Dreyfus felt when he read his story in stars and stripes.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's next step is to write home to his father.  Specifically, Hawkeye requests that his father attempt to get the attention of a certain senator.  What is this senator's name?", "correct": "Baxter", "options": ["Councill", "Shelby", "Fillmore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaxter.\n\n\tHawkeye's letter reads, in part, as follows: 'Dear Dad, you always said Senator Baxter was good for a favor because of all your work in the primaries, well I've got a favor that needs doing.'  Later we learn that Senator Baxter has been indicted for influence peddling and faces 20 years in the pokey! \n"}, {"text": "Henry gives Hawkeye some bad news, the letter to his dad has been stopped at division HQ.  Hawkeye is apoplectic, but Henry is unmoved.  It seems that the army is rebuilding Tai Dong, and Henry is satisfied with this.  Henry especially emphasizes what strange new feature that the rebuilt town will boast?", "correct": "Soft ice cream stand", "options": ["Drive-in restaurant", "Bowling alley", "Ice skating rink"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoft ice cream stand.\n\n\tHenry claims that Tai Dong will receive 'all new housing, a temple, a town hall with inside toilets, a shopping center, and they're getting the first soft ice cream stand in all of East Asia.'  \r Hawkeye is still unsatisfied, however.  He wants the village to be rebuilt *and* he wants justice! \n"}, {"text": "By the end of the episode, Hawkeye and Trapper are defeated; the army will not take responsibility for the incident at Tai Dong.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFrank Burns and Margaret save the day!  While Hawkeye and Trapper's report and evidence have been buried, Frank and Margaret have assembled a report of their own, complete with shell fragments and other evidence.  This prompts a resigned General Clayton to say, 'Even the army has to take its lumps. I guess this is one of those times!'\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
