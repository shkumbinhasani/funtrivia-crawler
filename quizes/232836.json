{"id": "232836", "name": "Where in Kanto Are We? Online Trivia | Pokemon Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Pokemon Games", " Pokemon Red/ Blue/Yellow"], "questions": [{"text": "Where are we if we're fighting Channelers?", "correct": "Pok\u00e9mon Tower", "options": ["Celadon City", "Route 22", "Fuchsia City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Tower.\n\n\tThe Pok\u00e9mon Tower is the large building in the east end of Lavender Town.  This building is haunted by ghost Pok\u00e9mon such as Gastly and Haunter, which can't be defeated with physical attacks.  Not only can ghost Pok\u00e9mon be found here though; Cubone is also found in all three versions of the game.  If we're playing \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", we can also find Jessie and James on the seventh floor of the building.  After fighting some Channelers and members of Team Rocket, we need to fight a Marowak and save Mr. Fuji. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're using our Bike Voucher?", "correct": "Cerulean City", "options": ["Route 5", "Vermilion City", "Pewter City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCerulean City.\n\n\tAlthough the Bike Voucher is picked up in Vermilion City, we don't actually use it unless we're trading it for a million-dollar bike in Cerulean City.  The bike is one of the better items in the game allowing us to move across Kanto much faster than we normally would.  Cerulean City is also home to the second gym leader, Misty, who uses water Pok\u00e9mon to her advantage.  Cerulean City connects to Mt. Moon to the west, and the Power Plant to the east. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're directly between Route 19 and Route 20?", "correct": "Seafoam Island", "options": ["Power Plant", "Victory Road", "Safari Zone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeafoam Island.\n\n\tThe only reason that we may want to even step foot onto Seafoam Island is to collect Articuno, a rare bird Pok\u00e9mon.  In order to get here, we can head east from Cinnabar Island or south-west from Fuchsia City.  Once inside, we'll need to use the Surf and Strength techniques to make our way through the caverns of the island.  The trickiest part is organizing large boulders to stop the fast current of the waters within the island.  This area has an abundance of water-type Pok\u00e9mon as well as Zubats and Golbats. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're choosing a Dome Fossil?", "correct": "Mount Moon", "options": ["Rock Tunnel", "Cinnabar Island", "Lavender Town"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Moon.\n\n\tThe Dome Fossil and the Helix Fossil are only found near the Cerulean City exit of Mt. Moon.  Only one of these can be ours in the game, and to get it we need to fight a member of Team Rocket.  To get the other one, we'll need to trade using the Link Cable or win one in \"Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\" (N64).  Once we get one of these fossils, we can take it to the Cinnabar Island lab (much like the Old Amber from Pewter City) and have it resurrected into a Pok\u00e9mon.  The Dome Fossil will become Kabuto and the Helix Fossil can be an Omanyte. \n"}, {"text": "Where could we be if we're getting one of the starter Pok\u00e9mon from the games (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Pikachu, or Squirtle) in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, or Yellow\"?", "correct": "Vermilion City", "options": ["Saffron City", "Unknown Dungeon", "Route 7"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVermilion City.\n\n\tThe starting Pok\u00e9mon of the three games are Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" and Pikachu in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".  Despite this, though, it's still possible to find these Pok\u00e9mon in different games.  Pikachu can be found in the wild in Viridian Forest and the Power Plant in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", while Bulbasaur can be found in Cerulean City, Charmander on Route 24, and Squirtle in Vermilion City in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".  Eevee, our rival's starting Pok\u00e9mon, can be found in Celadon City in all three games. \n"}, {"text": "Where could we be if we're in a town with two gyms?", "correct": "Saffron City", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaffron City.\n\n\tSaffron City not only contains Sabrina's psychic Pok\u00e9mon gym, but it also contains the fighting dojo.  The fighting dojo doesn't involve badges, but it does involve Pok\u00e9mon nonetheless.  If we beat the karate master of this gym, we can take a Hitmonlee or a Hitmonchan.  Both of these are extremely rare fighting Pok\u00e9mon, which can't be found elsewhere. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're catching Caterpies and Weedles, and in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red or Blue\", some Pikachus?", "correct": "Viridian Forest", "options": ["Power Plant", "Route 2", "Cinnabar Island"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViridian Forest.\n\n\tViridian Forest is a large area north of Viridian City and south of Pewter City.  Not only is it one of the largest areas filled with Pok\u00e9mon in the beginning of the game, but it also features our first trainers (Bug Catchers).  Although many of these trainers only carry Weedles, Kakunas, Caterpies, and Metapods, we can use these to gain experience for the boss battle in Pewter City. Pikachu can be found in this area in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", but he can only be given to us at the beginning of the game in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\".  In \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", we can also find Pidgeys and Pidgeottos in this area. \n"}, {"text": "Where are we if we're capturing Moltres?", "correct": "Victory Road", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictory Road.\n\n\tVictory Road is the final step on the way to the Elite Four.  We need to use HMs and our strongest Pok\u00e9mon to reach the end of the route and the well-known Indigo Plateau.  Here, we can also find our way to the legendary Moltres, the fiery bird Pok\u00e9mon.  The area is full of ground-type and rock-type Pok\u00e9mon at high levels, but at the end, you can heal and buy all the items you want. \n"}, {"text": "Which area are we in if we're using 'Flash' outside of battle?", "correct": "Rock Tunnel", "options": ["Unknown Dungeon", "Mount Moon", "Indigo Plateau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRock Tunnel.\n\n\tRock Tunnel is located between Route 9 and Route 10.  It contains many rock/ground/fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon, so it might be best to bring some water, grass, or psychic-types along with us.  We need to pass through the Rock Tunnel in order to reach Lavender Town, but to do that, we need to get HM05 (Flash) from Professor Oak's aide on Route 2.  Once we get this, we need to permanently teach it to one of our Pok\u00e9mon.  This is best done on an electric-type Pok\u00e9mon, but it's also possible to teach it to a psychic Pok\u00e9mon like Abra or Drowzee. \n"}, {"text": "Where could we NOT be if we're fighting Team Rocket members?", "correct": "Viridian City", "options": ["Lavender Town", "Mount Moon", "Celadon City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViridian City.\n\n\tTeam Rocket is Kanto's most famous crime syndicate, and they always seem to pop up in Kanto's cities.  Team Rocket can be found in Mt. Moon, Celadon City, Pok\u00e9mon Tower, Saffron City, and Silph Co.  Viridian City only contains Giovanni, the head of the organization.  At many of these locations, we can we can also find Jessie and James in \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\". \n"}]}
