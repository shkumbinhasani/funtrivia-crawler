As you travel across England to visit long lost relatives, you decide to take a break.  You pull over and stop at the nearest 'greasy spoon' cafe and are intrigued by the mention of the 'Full English' on the menu.  Of the following, which item would you NOT expect to be served as a part of your breakfast?", "correct": "Fried Okra", "options": ["Fried Eggs", "Pork Sausages", "Fried Bread"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFried Okra.\n\n\tThere will, most certainly, be variations on the basic breakfast in different areas of England. However, if you ordered a full english breakfast in most cafes/restaurants, you should expect to receive sausages, bacon, fried/poached or scrambled eggs, mushrooms, baked beans and/or grilled tomatoes, fried bread or toast and, if the cafe is up to scratch, a nice big mug of steaming hot tea, but most definitely NOT a portion of okra. I don't think that there are many countries in the world where you can go into a cafe at three o'clock in the afternoon and order a full cooked breakfast!  \r The 'Full English' is brimming with goodness! \n"}, {"text": "Team member Lil_Miss_Fickle says...

However, there must be some basis in fact as we ourselves have literally dozens of words that describe the less intelligent amongst us!  'Addle-aid', 'bacon-aid', 'daw-bake', 'stunpile' and 'gappermouth' are all words used, albeit, not so commonly these days, as mild insults toward the stupid.  An arrogant person may be described as 'Biggetty', if you were a good looking man (or woman) you might be 'anzum' and a spotty youth may be described as 'amper', 'bragety' or 'burly-vaced'. \n"}, {"text": "SisterSeagull would like to know if you can identify the Victorian poet and novelist who gave us the following literary works: 'The Mayor of Casterbridge', 'Far from the Madding Crowd' and 'Jude the Obscure'?", "correct": "Thomas Hardy", "options": ["Christopher Marlowe", "Charles Dickens", "Ralph Vaughan-Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Hardy.\n\n\tThomas Hardy was born in the village of Upper Bockhampton in the county of Dorset, England on the 2nd of June 1840, the son of a stonemason. Many of Hardy's literary works were critical of the society in which he lived and, as a countryman, his work reflected the decline in rural life that was taking place at the time.Although probably more famous for his novels, Hardy always considered himself, first and foremost, a poet even though his first poetry collection was not published until 1898. Hardy had moved to London in 1862 to attend Kings College, but returned to Dorset in 1867 to concentrate on his writing. Hardy married twice - firstly in 1874 and then again in 1914. Hardy was taken ill in December 1927 with pleurisy and died the following month on the 11th of January 1928. His ashes were interred in Poets Corner, Westminster Abbey but his heart was buried, where it belonged, in Stinsford, Dorset not far from the place of his birth. \n"}, {"text": "Team Leader, Superhooppete, would put money on the fact that you don't know which player of Spanish nationality, scored the first goal of the 2012/13 English Premier League season and against which team he scored it against, when the season 'kicked off' on the 18th of August 2012?

Just a short drive from Hayle in Cornwall lies the village of Phillack which has one such establishment.  It is the only pub in England to bear this name... but what name?", "correct": "The Bucket of Blood", "options": ["The Hung, Drawn and Quartered", "The Silenced Woman", "The Slaughtered Lamb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bucket of Blood.\n\n\tThe Bucket of Blood is one of my favourite public houses. It gained its name through local legend. Early one morning, around 200 years ago, the landlord went to draw water from his well. When the pail reached the top he was horrified to see that the water was coloured bright red with blood! On further investigation the dismembered body of a revenue officer was discovered having been thrown down the well by his killers - the pub's own customers!  \r The building looks the same now as it did hundreds of years ago. Flagstones on the floor, an open fire for when the wind howls in from the sea, creaking doors and windows and low, low beams in the ceiling. Sometimes, on a winters evening, you can hear the screams of the victim as the locals butcher him alive and, of course, the establishment is now haunted by the spirit of the murdered victim.\r The pub sign is enough to make your blood run cold as it sways and creaks in the wind... \n"}, {"text": "This quiz title, \"This Sceptred Isle...This England\", is taken from an historical work by William Shakespeare, England's greatest playwright, but SisterSeagull would like to know if you can identify the correct one?", "correct": "Richard II", "options": ["Measure for Measure", "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "Henry V"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard II.\n\n\t\"This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, \rThis earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, \rThis other Eden, demi-paradise, \rThis fortress built by Nature for herself \rAgainst infection and the hand of war, \rThis happy breed of men, this little world, \rThis precious stone set in the silver sea, \rWhich serves it in the office of a wall \rOr as a moat defensive to a house, \rAgainst the envy of less happier lands,-- \rThis blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England\".\r \"Richard II\", Act 2 scene 1 \n"}, {"text": "This question is posed by another team member.
