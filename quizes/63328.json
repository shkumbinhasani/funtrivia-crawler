What is the middle name of Commander William Riker (Johnathan Frakes) in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'?", "correct": "Thomas", "options": ["Tiberius", "Thelonious", "Timothy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas.\n\n\tFrakes, a jazz trombonist, lobbied with 'ST:TNG' producers to let his character's middle name be Thelonious (after Thelonious Monk)...but when a 'clone' of Riker was created in the sixth season episode 'Second Chances,' the 'other' Riker opted to take as his first name the middle name of the original William T. Riker, and 'Thomas' seemed a more viable first name than 'Thelonious,' for better or worse. Tiberius, of course, is the middle name of original 'Star Trek' captain James Kirk. \n"}, {"text": "What is the middle name of Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) in 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'?", "correct": "Lafayette", "options": ["Cornwallis", "Washington", "Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLafayette.\n\n\tStated several times during the seven-year run of 'ST:DS9,' my favorite of all the 'Star Trek' series (as unpopular an opinion as that may be).

George: 'GLC must live on!' \n"}, {"text": "The handyman on 'One Day At a Time' was an amusing character named Dwayne Schneider (Pat Harrington). What was his middle initial?", "correct": "F", "options": ["J", "T", "D"], "explanation": "\n\n\nF.\n\n\tTroy (Ethan Hawke) said it best in 'Reality Bites': 'You could cut the sexual tension between Schneider and Ann Romano with a knife.'

Fox) was arguably responsible for the enormous popularity of 'Family Ties.' What was his middle initial?", "correct": "P", "options": ["J", "T", "W"], "explanation": "\n\n\nP.\n\n\tEven if you've only watched the opening credits of the show, you should have gotten this one right -- his initials ('APK') were engraved in the silver-plated frame of the picture shown of his character. A number of players have sent me notes telling me that Alex's middle name was once revealed as \"Peace,\" but no one can point me to the episode in which that factoid was allegedly revealed, so for the moment, I'm considering it an urban legend.
