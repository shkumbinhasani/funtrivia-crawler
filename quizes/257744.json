{"id": "257744", "name": "How much do you know about The Pursuit of Happyness? | Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", " The Pursuit of Happyness"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Pursuit of Happyness\" is anchored to a very specific time and place, from the characters' constant use of buses and trains to a televised presidential address lamenting the state of the economy. Where and when is the movie set?", "correct": "San Francisco in 1981", "options": ["New York in 1990", "Chicago in 1972", "Dallas in 2004"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco in 1981.\n\n\tBART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), a heavy-rail train system that has served the San Francisco area since 1972, is almost a character in its own right. It aids in the escape of a thief, robs Gardner of a valuable item itself (when the \"Doors closing\" warning is issued, it means it!), gives him access to far-flung neighborhoods, and even provides some shelter at night.\r Ronald Reagan is the president who appears on a television screen early in the movie, talking obliquely about the recession and adding to the mood of financial desperation in the Gardner family. \n"}, {"text": "At the center of the film is the relationship between Chris Gardner (Will Smith) and his five-year-old son Christopher Jr. (Jaden Smith), a strong and loving bond despite the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. How did young Jaden land the part?", "correct": "He is the son of Will Smith.", "options": ["The director was impressed by his ease and charm in a cereal commercial.", "The director, choosing between Jaden and one other child, decided that it would be good luck for both leads to have the same last name.", "He is the grandson of the real Chris Gardner."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is the son of Will Smith.\n\n\tJaden Christopher Syre Smith, the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith, had quite an advantage in the casting process! The first role of any child actor is always a gamble, but in this film it paid off in a fine performance and in the clear love and ease between father and son.\r The real Christopher Jr. was only two years old when these events took place, and has said that he doesn't remember any of it. \n"}, {"text": "The title of the movie misspells the word \"happiness,\" but this isn't the fault of the marketing department. Instead, the misspelling is a reference to a sign that appears several times in the film. Where is the word \"happyness\" displayed?", "correct": "On a mural outside Christopher's daycare", "options": ["On a pamphlet posted all over the Gardners' neighborhood", "On a motivational sign by the brokerage elevator", "On an advertisement in the city buses"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a mural outside Christopher's daycare.\n\n\tThe outside wall of Christopher's Chinatown daycare sports a colorful mural filled with smiling children and inspiring words, from \"happyness\" to a few words of graffiti that aren't really appropriate for a daycare. Chris tries to get the spelling fixed, and attempts to explain the matter to his son after his efforts fail. A true five-year-old, Christopher next wants to know whether the graffiti was spelled right. \n"}, {"text": "Chris Gardner, his wife Linda, and their son Christopher are living on the edge of financial disaster. She works two shifts, while he spends his days trying to sell the not-quite-revolutionary medical equipment that they'd invested their life savings in. What type of equipment does Chris tote around the city, peddling to doctors and hospitals?", "correct": "Bone density scanners", "options": ["Portable MRI machines", "Ventilators", "Blood oxygen monitors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBone density scanners.\n\n\tChris's narration explains that bone density scanners are not quite the blockbuster he'd thought they would be: they yield a little more density than X-ray machines, but they're much, much more expensive. As a result, even this natural salesman has trouble closing the deal. About half a dozen scanners remain at the time the film begins, and as Chris comes home day after day without making any sales, his frazzled wife gets closer and closer to the edge. \n"}, {"text": "One bright day, Chris is strolling the streets of the Financial District, medical equipment in hand, when he gets the fateful idea to apply for an internship at the Dean Witter stock brokerage firm. What inspires him to make this bold move?", "correct": "He sees a stockbroker parking a luxurious red convertible.", "options": ["Reading a brochure about Dean Witter's services, he thinks, \"Hey, this is just sales. I can do that!\"", "He sees a colorful, persuasive poster advertising the internship.", "He overhears a conversation between two stockbrokers about their European vacation homes."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe sees a stockbroker parking a luxurious red convertible.\n\n\tThe stockbroker parks his glorious car right as Chris is walking by. Struck by the vehicle's sheer opulence, the medical salesman turns around and asks the driver: \"I have two questions for you. What do you do, and how do you do it?\" The stockbroker explains briefly, Chris starts thinking, and pretty soon he's persuaded himself he can do it.\r He soon finds out about Dean Witter's internship program, fills out an application, and sets about trying to charm the internship director so that he'll see beyond the fact that Chris has only a high school education. Sadly, his new plan does not go over well at home. \"From salesman to intern?\" Linda asks. \"That's backwards!\" This is the last blow their marriage can take; she makes plans to leave him. \n"}, {"text": "As the application process continues, Chris suffers further setbacks. Linda leaves, taking with her the family's only regular paycheck. Chris's landlord evicts him, allowing him to stay an extra few days with young Christopher only if Chris agrees to paint the place himself. Finally, Chris's final interview for the internship arrives -- and he is forced to arrive unshowered, unshaven and half-dressed. Why?", "correct": "While he was painting the day before, he'd been arrested for failure to pay parking tickets and held overnight in jail.", "options": ["While he was painting the previous day, he'd been evicted anyway, and had no place to clean up and change.", "Out of spite, Linda had taken all of his business suits when she left.", "He'd started painting the apartment that morning, remembering the interview only just in time to catch the train downtown."], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhile he was painting the day before, he'd been arrested for failure to pay parking tickets and held overnight in jail.\n\n\tChris's car was impounded for failure to pay parking tickets early in the movie, but the debt remains. At the police station, he writes a check for the balance -- there's just enough to cover it -- but he's held until the check clears at 9:30 in the morning. That leaves just 45 minutes to get to the Financial District and the interview, and nowhere near enough time to change into a suit or clean the dried paint off his trousers and undershirt.\r It had taken a great deal of dedication to line this interview up; Chris had gone so far as to get into the internship director's taxi and prove his intellectual mettle by solving a Rubik's cube during the ride. Considering the value of first impressions, it looks as though everything is lost when he shows up for the interview dressed as a housepainter, but he manages to carry it off with candor, charm and wit. (\"What would you say if a man came in here without a shirt, and I hired him?\" asks the chairman of the company. \"I'd say he must have had really great pants,\" Chris replies.)\r He's offered a coveted position in the internship program, but realizes during the interview that the six-month internship is unpaid. He considers his options, weighs his sinking bank balance against his dreams, and decides to give it a shot. \n"}, {"text": "At first, Chris seems to be holding it all together. He drops Christopher off at daycare, heads to work and spends the day making sales calls, striving for the job offer that awaits the best intern. He leaves at 4:00 (the other interns stay until the evening) to pick his son up and take him home to the long-term motel. On weekends he sells medical equipment, making just enough to cover rent and food. Then, one day, this delicate balancing act is disrupted, Chris's bank account is emptied, and he and his son face ruin. How does this happen?", "correct": "The IRS collects the Gardner's taxes from the previous year -- directly from Chris's bank account.", "options": ["Linda, living in New York now, needs money for rent and makes a withdrawal from their joint account.", "Chris's last two pieces of medical equipment are lost or stolen, and he has no way to earn money.", "Unbeknownst to Chris, his bank has started charging fees for low-balance accounts, and these quickly empty the account."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe IRS collects the Gardner's taxes from the previous year -- directly from Chris's bank account.\n\n\tThe Gardners' IRS bill -- mentioned earlier in the film as well -- comes to only about $650, but it's too much for them to pay while keeping a roof over their heads and food on the table. The IRS isn't so concerned about all that, so they simply take the money from Chris's bank account, leaving him with $25 and change. How will he feed his son and pay for daycare and housing? \n"}, {"text": "After Chris's bank account is emptied, a second eviction isn't far behind. Father and son come home one night to find their motel room lock changed and their belongings boxed and bagged in the corridor. Where do they go for shelter on their first night of homelessness?", "correct": "The men's room of a subway station", "options": ["A park bench by a fountain", "The sidewalk in front of a nearby office building, where the grates provide heat", "The motel corridor (which does, after all, have a roof)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe men's room of a subway station.\n\n\tChristopher takes the eviction very badly, throwing a tantrum in the corridor and demanding that his dad just open the door. He's five years old, after all; how can his father possibly explain the system to him in a way he'll understand? They head to a BART station, where Chris manages to turn the outing into an adventure (and the men's room into an exciting \"cave\").\r Most of their belongings are left behind; there's just no way for the two of them to carry them all. They keep their clothing, a few beloved toys for Christopher, and the last bone density scanner -- Chris's only hope of income for the next few months. \n"}, {"text": "The Gardners' homelessness makes it quite a lot harder for Chris to face the challenges of his internship -- and not just because the nature of his job reminds him constantly that he is a \"have not\" among \"haves.\" He has found only one shelter that will take both him and his son -- the one run by Glide Memorial Church -- but the nature of the shelter imposes new obstacles. Why?", "correct": "The shelter is first-come, first-served, so he must race there every afternoon to get beds.", "options": ["The shelter is located in a loud neighborhood, and lack of sleep begins to take a toll on Chris's performance.", "The shelter requires regular drug testing, which Chris finds humiliating and inconvenient.", "The shelter administrators have trouble believing that a man with such a prestigious internship really requires their services, and Chris must go to great lengths to persuade them."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe shelter is first-come, first-served, so he must race there every afternoon to get beds.\n\n\tMany are called to the Glide shelter, but few can be chosen: there just aren't enough beds. The line stretches around the block on most evenings. So Chris has to leave work early, head to Chinatown to get Christopher from daycare, take the bus to the Tenderloin district, and stand in line with other hopefuls, hoping that he and his son will make the cutoff. Both father and son sacrifice in these daily races; there's a heartbreaking shot of young Christopher's face after his beloved Captain America doll is inadvertently left in the street.\r Chris tries to get them into another shelter, but most take only women and children; Glide is the only place where he and his son can be together. The strain of trying every afternoon to find a room -- and, some nights, failing -- takes a heavy toll. Although Chris is a natural salesman and is having great success landing accounts at Dean Witter, his increasing despair has visible effects. \n"}, {"text": "During the last few weeks of the internship, Chris finally has a stroke of good luck: he manages to repair and sell his last remaining piece of medical equipment, and he and his son stay in a long-term motel. Words cannot express how much this improves their situation -- but Chris can't help worrying about what will happen if he doesn't land that coveted Dean Witter job at the end of the internship. Does he get the job?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIn the end, Chris Gardner's hard work and dedication pay off with a handsomely paid job at the Dean Witter brokerage firm. He is so touched, and so relieved, at getting the job that he nearly loses his composure in the boardroom, and as he leaves the building to pick up his son at daycare he can't help crying in earnest. His struggle is over; his dream has arrived; his better life can now begin. As he is surrounded by a crowd of successful brokers on the sidewalk, the real Chris Gardner -- who started his own brokerage firm (Gardner Rich) several years later -- passes by, and the two exchange nods.\r Though it took a few liberties with Gardner's life story, \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" is a beautiful and moving film. I hope you've enjoyed the movie and this quiz! \n"}]}
