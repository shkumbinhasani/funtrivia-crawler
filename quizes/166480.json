{"id": "166480", "name": "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind Quiz | Movies | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"], "questions": [{"text": "Where does the first scene in this film take place?", "correct": "Mexico", "options": ["Mongolia", "The United States of America", "deep space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico.\n\n\tAs a Jeep is shown driving through a sandstorm, we're shown a title card that reads \"Sonora Desert, Mexico\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the first line spoken in this film?", "correct": "\"Are we the first?\"", "options": ["\"Watch the skies!\"", "\"Who are you people?\"", "\"We are not alone.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Are we the first?\".\n\n\tOne of the nameless (and virtually faceless) men working for the U.S. government (is he SETI?  FBI?  CIA?) asks this question of the first Mexican national he sees.  He then repeats the question in Spanish. \n"}, {"text": "David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) spends almost the entire film acting as translator for Claude Lacombe, a Frenchman who speaks very little English.  Laughlin's own dialogue reveals that he is not, in fact, a translator by trade.  What is Laughlin's actual job?", "correct": "cartographer", "options": ["archaeologist", "astronomer", "geologist"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncartographer.\n\n\tBefore Laughlin more or less stumbled into the job of translating for Lacombe, he was a cartographer, or mapmaker.  Conveniently, his expertise in this area later facilitates the \"translation\" of the aliens' signals into cartographic coordinates. \n"}, {"text": "An early scene in the film depicts a number of air traffic controllers dealing with the fallout following a near-collision with a UFO.  How many (terrestrial) aircraft were involved in this incident?", "correct": "two & 2", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntwo & 2.\n\n\tThe head flight traffic controller asks the pilots of two aircraft, in turn, if they want to file reports detailing an encounter with a UFO.  Both pilots flatly decline, presumably because they wouldn't know how to word what they had experienced, and/or didn't want to be labeled as \"crazy\". \n"}, {"text": "When we first meet Barry Guiler (Cary Guffey) and his mother Jillian (Melinda Dillon), a number of electrical and electronic items in their home spring to life as a result of the aliens' influence.  One such item is the record player in Barry's room.  The record in question is instructional in nature, and features a \"sing-along\" format.  On what pre-school discipline is the record focused on teaching young Barry?", "correct": "shapes", "options": ["letters", "numbers", "colors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nshapes.\n\n\tThe woman singing on the record is trying to teach her audience about the shape of a square versus that of a rectangle. \n"}, {"text": "When we first meet Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), he is excited at the prospect of taking his children to see a particular film. What's the film?", "correct": "Pinocchio", "options": ["Forbidden Planet", "The Cat From Outer Space", "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPinocchio.\n\n\tRoy tells his kids that the film is even more enjoyable than \"goofy golf,\" which I assume is some version of miniature golf.  The song \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" from the soundtrack of \"Pinocchio,\" is referenced a couple of times in John Williams' score for this film. \n"}, {"text": "Roy Neary has three children.  Which is NOT the name of one of his children?", "correct": "Ronnie", "options": ["Toby", "Brad", "Sylvia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonnie.\n\n\tRonnie is actually the name of Roy's wife, played by Teri Garr.  Toby Neary, by the way, is played by Justin Dreyfuss, the nephew of the man who plays his father. \n"}, {"text": "Just before the power goes out in the Neary house, it's revealed that Roy has told his children that they can stay up late to watch a particluar movie.  What movie is it?", "correct": "The Ten Commandments", "options": ["The Wizard of Oz", "The Greatest Story Ever Told", "2001: A Space Odyssey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ten Commandments.\n\n\tRonnie Neary seems less than pleased with this arrangement, noting that the film is over three hours long. \n"}, {"text": "Just before the UFOs cause a major blackout in the Nearys' neighborhood, we see a McDonald's restaurant.  In 2004, most of us know that McDonald's signs now read \"Billions and Billions Served\"...but this film was released in 1977.  According to the sign at this particular McDonald's, how many people had been served?", "correct": "24 billion", "options": ["120 billion", "240 billion", "12 billion"], "explanation": "\n\n\n24 billion.\n\n\tJerry Seinfeld once opined that those signs were a bit self-indulgent.  He would have preferred a sign that simply said, \"McDonald's: We're Doing Very Well.\" \n"}, {"text": "During the blackout, Roy gets hopelessly lost trying to find a particular road.  What's the name of the road?", "correct": "Cornbread", "options": ["Cobbler", "Ambrosia", "Aspic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCornbread.\n\n\tAfter Roy is cursed at by a fellow motorist, he sarcastically asks, \"Do you know where Cornbread is?  TURKEY!\"  (Note to players born after 1980: \"turkey\" used to be a nasty name to call someone.  Just so you know.) \n"}, {"text": "When Roy's truck, stopped in front of a railroad crossing, is scanned by a UFO, a number of strange things happen.  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Roy's hair stands on end.", "options": ["The gauges in Roy's truck go haywire.", "Roy's flashlight goes out.", "The crickets outside the truck stop chirping."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoy's hair stands on end.\n\n\tRoy gets a nasty \"sunburn\" on one side of his face when he looks up at the undercarriage of the UFO, but nothing unusual happens to his hair. \n"}, {"text": "Roy's truck is parked next to a row of mailboxes when he is scanned by the UFO.  One of the mailboxes is clearly marked with a name.  What's the name?", "correct": "Dickson", "options": ["Willis", "Smart", "Little"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDickson.\n\n\tThe mailboxes thrash about wildly, an odd side effect of the UFO's presence. \n"}, {"text": "Roy actually SEES the UFO that scans him at the railroad crossing.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tRoy's first glimpse at the UFO isn't very useful -- a bright discharge seems to hurt his eyes (and \"sunburn\" his face), but after the scan is complete and the UFO starts to move on, Roy looks up through his windshield and gets a decent (if shadowy) look at the craft as it glides away.  The expression on his face makes it clear that he's getting a pretty good eyeful. \n"}, {"text": "Just before Barry Guiler and and his mother meet Roy Neary for the first time, Barry encounters an old man (played by Roberts Blossom and credited as simply \"Farmer\") who is whistling.  What's the name of the song he's whistling?", "correct": "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain", "options": ["Pop Goes the Weasel", "When You Wish Upon a Star", "The High and the Mighty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain.\n\n\tQuite appropriate, considering that several small UFOs \"come around the mountain\" only seconds later...and one could also interpret the use of this tune as foreshadowing to the approach of the mother ship later in the film. \n"}, {"text": "As Barry waves to the \"Farmer,\" he (Barry) is wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the name of a particular institute of higher learning.  Which one?", "correct": "Boston University", "options": ["Duke University", "University of Notre Dame", "UCLA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston University.\n\n\tWhy Barry wears a shirt with \"BOSTON UNIV\" on it is never explained, as he and Jillian live in Indiana.  Perhaps his mother went to school there? \n"}, {"text": "As police officers (and Roy Neary) chase a group of low-flying UFOs around in the dark caused by the blackout, there's a mildly funny moment in which the UFOs fly through a toll booth, restoring its power.  What U.S. state do the UFOs enter by passing through this toll booth?", "correct": "Ohio", "options": ["Indiana", "Michigan", "Illinois"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOhio.\n\n\tA sign at the toll booth clearly reads \"Ohio State Line.\"  Since the UFOs started in Indiana, they're apparently headed east at this point. \n"}, {"text": "The Nearys have a nosy next-door neighbor who is simply flabbergasted by Roy's highly unorthodox behavior.  What's her name?", "correct": "Mrs. Harris", "options": ["Mrs. Hayes", "Mrs. Vaughn", "Mrs. Taylor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMrs. Harris\n\n\tMrs. Harris -- from whose garden Roy eventually steals the chicken wire he needs for his giant model of Devil's Tower -- is played by Mary Gafrey. \n"}, {"text": "Roy drags his wife and kids out of bed in the middle of the night to the spot where he and the Guilers saw the small UFOs.  When Roy's wife asks what the craft looked like, Roy answers, \"Like an ice cream cone.\"  His wife asks, \"What flavor?\"  What is Roy's response?", "correct": "\"Orange.\"", "options": ["\"Vanilla.\"", "\"Peppermint.\"", "\"Strawberry.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Orange.\"\n\n\tRoy actually saw several UFOs that sported a variety of colors, but apparently the orange one sticks out the most in Roy's mind.  (Do they even MAKE orange-flavored ice cream...?) \n"}, {"text": "We're shown the highly unusual image of an ocean liner that is discovered in the middle of a desert -- deposited there, it seems, by the aliens who had abducted it years before.  What is the name of this ship?", "correct": "the COTOPAXI", "options": ["the MOSHULU", "the ALBA VARTEN", "the NOSTROMO"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe COTOPAXI.\n\n\tThe COTOPAXI is presumably named for Mt. Cotopaxi, the world's tallest active volcano, located in Ecuador.  An interesting note from http://www.ecuador-images.net/mountain.cotopaxi.htm: \"Loosely translated from the Quechua, Cotopaxi means 'Smooth Neck of the Moon'.\"  Could the fact that the ship's name references a celestial body (albeit a close one) have anything to do with its having been chosen for abduction?  Hmmm...\r By the way, all of the wrong choices in this question refer to ships from other famous movies.  Can you name them all?  =) \n"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, back at the Neary house, Roy's children decide to have some fun with him and take a picture of him while he is doing something decidedly un-photogenic.  What is Roy doing when his children surprise him with the Polaroid?", "correct": "brushing his teeth", "options": ["going to the bathroom", "showering", "picking his nose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbrushing his teeth.\n\n\tHis son spanks him with a ping-pong paddle, and when Roy spins around, his mouth is full of toothpaste as the picture is snapped.  Roy is laughing, though, and growling like a beast, which suggests that the kids didn't really sneak up on him at all. \n"}, {"text": "The first time we hear the by-now-legendary five-note \"musical message\" of the aliens, it is being sung by a large group of people.  On what continent does this scene take place?", "correct": "Asia", "options": ["South America", "Africa", "Europe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsia.\n\n\tMore specifically, hundreds (perhaps thousands?) of people are singing the tune in a desert in India. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the film, Roy Neary is plagued by the image of a certain shape.  He sees the shape manifest itself in a number of rather odd places.  Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "in Play-Doh", "options": ["in a mudpile", "in mashed potatoes", "in shaving cream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nin Play-Doh.\n\n\tBarry Guiler builds a small mountain out of a mudpile, and Roy recognizes the shape (\"Dammit, I KNOW this,\" he says).  Roy also sees a mountain-like shape in a palmful of shaving cream and, perhaps most famously, in a huge amassment of mashed potatoes on his dinner plate.  We never see any Play-Doh in the film, even though Roy has three young children. \n"}, {"text": "Roy and Jillian return to the spot where they first saw the small UFOs, and they are joined by numerous other spectators as well.  Presumably, all assembled are hoping that the UFOs revisit the same spot.  When bright lights are spotted in the distance, one man cries out, \"Look! Out of the ________________ !\"  What's the missing word?", "correct": "northwest", "options": ["northeast", "southeast", "southwest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnorthwest.\n\n\tUnfortunately, the lights in question are generated by helicopters, not aliens. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Farmer\" is one of the assembled onlookers hoping for another close encounter.  He has fashioned a sign out of poster board.  What does it say?", "correct": "STOP AND BE FRIENDLY", "options": ["TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER", "WE MEAN YOU NO HARM", "WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSTOP AND BE FRIENDLY.\n\n\tSeems like a sensible sentiment to me. \n"}, {"text": "The group of scientists who have been tracking the movements of the aliens suddenly realize that they need a globe, so they hijack one from the nearby County Supervisor's office.  They treat it rather roughly, though, causing one municipal employee to point out how expensive the globe is.  How much is the globe worth?", "correct": "$2500", "options": ["$1500", "$1000", "$2000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$2500.\n\n\tOnce the pins are pulled from the armature and the enormous globe hits the floor, we hear a voice call out, \"Hey!  That's a $2500 globe!\"\r Hope you liked this one.  Part II will soon follow. \n"}]}
