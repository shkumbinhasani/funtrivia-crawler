{"id": "188323", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - Charles Emerson Winchester III Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "M*A*S*H - Characters and Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "Major Charles Emerson Winchester III was brought on the television show 'M*A*S*H' to replace the beloved Frank Burns.  During which season of the show did Charles first appear?", "correct": "6th", "options": ["4th", "7th", "5th"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6th.\n\n\tCharles Emerson Winchester III first appeared in the 6th season episode entitled 'Fade In, Fade Out'.  Frank Burn's last appearance was in the 5th season episode entitled 'Margaret's Wedding'.  Winchester immediately found himself in Frank's place in more ways than one.  Not only did he replace him as a surgeon, he also replaced him as a rival to Hawkeye and BJ.  Charles brought a certain sophistication and panache that Frank lacked...bringing a different feel to the rivalry than had previously existed. \n"}, {"text": "Who portrayed Charles Emerson Winchester III, a character with a vocabulary the size of Alaska and an ego to match?", "correct": "David Ogden Stiers", "options": ["Larry Linville", "Wayne Rogers", "Mike Farrell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers.\n\n\tFor you 'M*A*S*H'-o-philes out there this question was utterly simple.  David Ogden Stiers, who also appeared in several Perry Mason television episodes in the late 1980s, along with numerous other television and film appearances (not to mention appearances in voice in various children's films) was the lovely fellow who developed Charles' pomposity to an elevated pitch.  From what I have gathered, in 'real life' Mr. Stiers is anything but arrogant and overbearing. \n"}, {"text": "For those of you who are fans of the show, this question should be simplicity itself.  What American city does Charles call home?", "correct": "Boston", "options": ["Baltimore", "San Francisco", "Atlanta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston.\n\n\tCharles is what you might refer to as a Boston blue blood, though some might consider the poor fellow to be nouveau riche.  He certainly does go through endless efforts to establish himself as a member of the highest class.  However, we must not forget that Charles was once outclassed by 'the son of a bloody butler' (recall the episode 'U.N., the Night and the Music'). \n"}, {"text": "Charles sometimes talks of his sister who lives back home in the states.  What is her rather pretentious name?", "correct": "Honoria", "options": ["Caesaria", "Calpurnia", "Agrippina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHonoria.\n\n\tCharles has one sister, Honoria, a name that hearkens back to ancient Rome.  Interestingly, we discover in one season eleven episode that Honoria suffers from a severe stuttering problem.  Her name is pronounced with emphasis on the second syllable, don't make the same pronounciation mistake that Colonel Flagg makes! \n"}, {"text": "Charles is an extremely gifted surgeon, no doubt, but in an episode during the 8th season of 'M*A*S*H' he reveals that he always wanted to excel at playing what musical instrument?", "correct": "Piano", "options": ["Violin", "Guitar", "Harp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiano.\n\n\tCharles prides himself in his excellent skills as a surgeon, to be sure.  However, he reveals in the season eight episode called 'Morale Victory' that he always wanted to become a concert pianist.  He was unable to make the kind of beautiful music that a truly gifted pianist (such as his mother) could make. \n"}, {"text": "In another episode, Charles dabbles in the playing of another musical instrument, this time driving his Swamp-mates to distraction.  Which instrument does Charles 'play' in the season six episode called 'The Smell of Music'?", "correct": "French horn", "options": ["Viola", "Clarinet", "Accordian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrench horn.\n\n\tCharles is really unable to play the french horn at all, he simply blows into the metal contraption randomly, producing an utterly cacophonous din.  Hawkeye and BJ exact revenge on Charles for his musical ineptitude by refusing to shower for days.  The entire situation is resolved when Hawkeye and BJ receive an involuntary bath and Charles' french horn is flattened under a jeep as directed by Margaret, the true hero of the episode! \n"}, {"text": "Charles Emerson Winchester III is a proud graduate of the medical school at Yale University.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tGood lord, no!  Never let Charles know I asked this question, it would be the end of me.  Charles graduated from Harvard Medical School in Boston, and went on to practice thoracic surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. \n"}, {"text": "Entering the 4077th as a bachelor, Charles Emerson Winchester III is legitimately married to a fine young lady while appearing on the show.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tCharles came close to a matrimonial entanglement twice during the run of the series, but he was never actually married.  In the season seven episode 'Ain't Love Grand', Charles attempts to play the role of Henry Higgins to a Korean Eliza Doolittle (played by Sylvia Chang), but fails to woo her properly. In the season eight episode 'Mr. and Mrs. Who?', Charles believes himself to be married to a woman (played by Claudette Nevins) but then finds out that their wedding was phony.  BJ has the honors of unmarrying Mr. and Mrs. Winchester, and delivers the wonderful line, 'Do you Chuck Emerson Winchester the third take this lovely, if gullible young woman as your unlawful, unwedded, unwife?' \n"}, {"text": "In the penultimate episode of 'M*A*S*H', entitled 'As Time Goes By', the members of the 4077th place a variety of items in a time capsule.  Charles leaves a bottle of what sort of alcoholic drink for posterity?", "correct": "Cognac", "options": ["Beer", "Scotch", "Champagne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCognac.\n\n\tCharles is the one who initially raises the concept of a time capsule while reading a newspaper, which sparks Margaret to create one for the 4077th which will soon be disbanding.  Charles chooses a bottle of cognac as his contribution, insisting to Margaret that it will be well over 100 years old when finally opened and enjoyed.  What style the man has! \n"}, {"text": "In the final episode of 'M*A*S*H', entitled 'Goodbye, Farewell and Amen', Charles is taken away from the 4077th in a garbage truck.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSoon after discovering that he will be head of Thoracic Surgery at Boston Mercy Hospital, Charles finds himself leaving the 4077th in the most ironic of conveyances, a garbage truck driven by Luther Rizzo.  Just before boarding the truck, Charles gave Margaret a copy of 'Sonnets from the Portuguese' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a lovely gesture.  The man may be full of hubris, but he understands the finer things in life.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz.
