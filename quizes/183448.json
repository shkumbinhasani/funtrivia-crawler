{"id": "183448", "name": "Movies about Siamese Twins Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Stuck on You"], "questions": [{"text": "Only one pair of brothers would be daring enough to direct a film such as 'Stuck on You' that deals with the sensitive topic of 'conjoined twins'.  What is the last name of these gritty brothers?", "correct": "Farrelly", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFarrelly.\n\n\tBobby and Peter Farrelly have a penchant for tackling the tough and precarious topics, and their leap into the world of conjoined twins is no exception.  It's doubtful that another director (or set of directors) could have pulled off a comedy about Siamese twins that could amuse on one hand and avoid offense (at least, for the most part) on the other. \n"}, {"text": "In the film 'Stuck on You', which of these pairs of actors were able to make the kind of connection needed to believably portray Bob and Walt, a pair of conjoined brothers?", "correct": "Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear", "options": ["Jean Claude van Damme and Cheech Marin", "Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman", "Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Damon and Greg Kinnear.\n\n\tAlthough the other choices I listed would have made intriguing Siamese twins, it was none other than Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear who pulled off the difficult task of playing conjoined twins in 'Stuck on You'.  Greg Kinnear was marvelous as the brazen and acerbic actor Walt, while Matt Damon managed well in his straight man role as the athletic, nerve-ridden Bob. \n"}, {"text": "'Stuck on You' opens in the cold winter confines of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.  The brothers own a fast food restaurant there, and are experts at the grill.  What is the name of the little eatery where they work their burger flipping magic?", "correct": "Quickee Burger", "options": ["Hamburger Heaven", "Get 'Em and Grill", "Buns and Beef"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuickee Burger.\n\n\tBob and Walt are maestros behind the counter as they produce beautiful burgers and fries on their kitchen canvas.  Their restaurant has a gimmick, if a customer's meal isn't prepared within three minutes then it's on the house.  During the opening scenes a group of men challenge the brothers with a 'tester' (as the waitress calls it), but Bob and Walt are up to the task. \n"}, {"text": "Life is good for the conjoined Bob and Walt, but still, there's something missing for Walt in Martha's Vineyard.  You see, Walt dreams of an acting career and he convinces Bob to tag along with him to Hollywood to fulfill his dreams.  Bob will benefit from the trip as well, as he has been corresponding with a young woman from the Los Angeles area for three years and he will finally be able to meet her in person.  What is her name?", "correct": "May Fong", "options": ["Pima Singh", "Hortensia Estevez", "Sofia Sokhalov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMay Fong.\n\n\tBob has been developing a relationship with May over the internet using the e-mail handle 'holdthepickle', a reference to his proud vocation as a burger flipper.  May and Bob have exchanged pictures, but unfortunately, Bob has managed to delete his brother Walt from the photos.  May is in for a shock! \n"}, {"text": "Bob and Walt are conjoined at the torso, and especially share which of the following body parts?", "correct": "Liver", "options": ["Stomach", "Heart", "Pancreas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiver.\n\n\tOne might ask at the beginning of the film (if one insists on activating their cerebral cortex for such a movie!), why have not the brothers sought surgery to separate themselves?  Well, they have inquired about it, but were informed by doctors that Walt would only have a 50/50 shot of surviving the procedure.  Naturally, the Farrelly brothers milk the 'liver' motif for all it is worth during the film. \n"}, {"text": "Upon reaching Hollywood, the brothers go to work in seeking acting roles for Walt, but are rather unsuccessful in the process. In the course of their search, they happen to encounter one of their acting heroes.  Which Oscar winner do they stumble upon in a Hollywood cafe? ", "correct": "Meryl Streep", "options": ["Michael Douglas", "Sally Field", "Gene Hackman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeryl Streep.\n\n\tEarly in the film the brothers comment on Meryl Streep and her connections with Martha's Vineyard.  Lo and behold, shortly after they arrive in Hollywood they meet the actress in a small bistro.  Initially, Meryl reacts to the brothers in a somewhat aloof manner, but then she recognizes them as the star quarterback and halfback (in a rather hilarious flashback scene, I might add) on their high school football team.  Later in the film, Meryl appears in Walt's musical version of 'Bonnie and Clyde'. \n"}, {"text": "Another Oscar winner, Cher, generously appears in this little film.  What is the name of the rather abrasive character Cher portrays in 'Stuck on You'?", "correct": "Cher", "options": ["Fanny Bodango", "Colette LaGuille", "Sylvia Frupper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCher.\n\n\tCher portrays none other than herself in this film, and plays herself rather marvelously, I might add.  In actuality, Cher behaves in a rather callous fashion, dismissing the brothers in a brusque manner until she realizes she needs to utilize them for her own devious machinations. \n"}, {"text": "During their first meeting, Cher largely disregards the brothers.  Later, she realizes that they may be of use.  What is the name of the action/drama television series in which Cher wishes Walt to co-star?", "correct": "Honey and the Beaze", "options": ["Sugar and the Melman", "Toffee and the Trucker", "Candy and the Hoopah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoney and the Beaze.\n\n\tCher is very unhappy with the television show concept, and wants to terminate the job as soon as possible.  In her contract she is allowed to select her own co-star, and hence she chooses Walt in the hopes that his unusual disability will quickly get the show cancelled.  The plan backfires as the Beaze character (played by Walt) is an instant hit with fans. \n"}, {"text": "In her personal life, Cher is known on occasion to have dated a few men who have been, shall we say, less elevated in age.  In 'Stuck on You', which of these actors plays Cher's latest love interest?", "correct": "Frankie Muniz", "options": ["Haley Joel Osment", "Macauley Culkin", "Aaron Carter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrankie Muniz.\n\n\tFrankie Muniz, who has become famous for his roles in the television series 'Malcolm in the Middle' and various films, makes a special appearance as Cher's amour du jour.  In one scene, Cher requests that Muniz, 'Go to bed. You have a geography test in the morning.'  Cher was quite a sport to have made such fun of her personal life in the film. \n"}, {"text": "By the end of 'Stuck on You', the seasoned Hollywood actor Walt is able to fulfill his dreams and stage a musical version of what Hollywood classic film?", "correct": "Bonnie and Clyde", "options": ["Gone with the Wind", "Casablanca", "Ben Hur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonnie and Clyde.\n\n\tThe twins elect to have separation surgery towards the end of the film, and Bob leaves for Massachusetts with May Fong soon after.  Both twins find it very difficult to be without their better halves, and Walt also eventually returns to Martha's Vineyard to reunite with his brother.  There he stages a magical, musical version of 'Bonnie and Clyde', with Greg Kinnear actually singing the lyrics.  \r I hope you have enjoyed this little test and will try some of my other quizzes. \n"}]}
