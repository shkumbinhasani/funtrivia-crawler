Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "The theme song of the show is different from the first three seasons.", "options": ["Gil Grissom (William Petersen) is shown with a beard.", "The episode ends with a title card reading \"To Be Continued\".", "All of these \"firsts\" happened in this episode."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe theme song of the show is different from the first three seasons.\n\n\t\"Assume Nothing\" gives us our first-ever view of a bearded Grissom, and the episode does indeed end with a dramatic \"To Be Continued\" title card, which had never happened before.  The theme song (an abbreviated version of \"Who Are You?\" by The Who) is exactly the same as it was in the first three seasons. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 1, \"Assume Nothing,\" one member of the CSI team puts his/her career in serious jeopardy by off-handedly sharing information about a crime scene with a civilian, who later shares said information with the press.  Which member of the team gets in trouble for having loose lips?", "correct": "Nick Stokes (George Eads)", "options": ["Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan)", "Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger)", "Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNick Stokes (George Eads).\n\n\tNick, while trying to trace the path that the suspects in question took after committing multiple homicides, runs across an old buddy from college (played by Josh Holloway, who went on to become famous for his role as Sawyer on \"LOST\"!).  Nick mentions that the hotel room under investigation has been given the nickname \"Murder Central\" by CSIs, and his old buddy presumably leaks that inside info to the first TV reporter he sees. \n"}, {"text": "Gil Grissom, ever the quote-dropper, shares the glory in \"Assume Nothing\" when he and a murder suspect churn out a Shakespeare quote together:  \"Let me not the marriage of true minds admit impediments/Love is not love [...] but bears it out till [sic] the edge of doom.\"  Which work of Shakespeare are Grissom and the murder suspect quoting?", "correct": "one of the sonnets", "options": ["Romeo and Juliet", "a letter that Shakespeare wrote to his wife, Anne Hathaway", "A Midsummer Night's Dream"], "explanation": "\n\n\none of the sonnets.\n\n\tThe quote comes from \"Sonnet CXVI: Let Me Not to the Marriage of Two Minds\".  Gil and his suspect get a few words wrong, but the import of the sonnet is, as Gil says to the suspect, \"Love is not conditional.\" \n"}, {"text": "There's a feud in effect in episode 2, \"All For Our Country\", and it's not pretty.  Which two groups of people find themselves in direct and ugly conflict, thanks to the particulars of the murder case being investigated?", "correct": "the CSI's and the Las Vegas Police Department", "options": ["the male CSI's and the female CSI's", "the \"day shift\" CSI's and the \"night shift\" CSI's", "the CSI's and the press corps of Las Vegas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe CSI's and the Las Vegas Police Department.\n\n\tGrissom initially suspects that police officers (specifically, from the Homicide division, which Captain Jim Brass oversees) might be responsible for the murder that he is trying to solve.  This eventually gets Grissom and Brass shouting at each other, and Grissom even winds up being blatantly threatened by a uniformed officer in the parking lot of CSI headquarters! \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"All For Our Country,\" a college student dies thanks to a blow to the head.  Where was he when he received this fatal head wound?", "correct": "in a bar", "options": ["in the bathtub", "at a concert", "in his car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nin a bar.\n\n\tWhile watching a football game in a sports bar, Daniel O'Hannissey got sucker-punched in the back of the head by Wayne, a young man who was angry that Daniel's college team was beating the team from his own college.  \r The shark-shaped ring that Wayne wore punctured Daniel's skull and caused a subdural hematoma -- a \"slow leak,\" as described by coroner Albert Robbins (Robert David Hall).  A few hours later, Daniel died while taking a bath. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 3, \"Homebodies\", Grissom and his crew use something other than the usual fingerprint to identify their suspect, a man who enjoys breaking into people's homes and robbing/brutalizing/raping the inhabitants.  What do the CSI's use to identify this guy?", "correct": "a bite mark", "options": ["dandruff", "a footprint", "ear wax"], "explanation": "\n\n\na bite mark.\n\n\tSteve Jansson, the suspect in question, left behind dental impressions at the scenes of two of his crimes -- when he took a big bite out of a piece of cake at the home of an elderly woman, and when he bit the shoulder of a teenager while he was sexually assaulting her.\r Unfortunately, despite the bite-mark evidence, the suspect was never actually arrested, since the sexual assault victim was unable to bring herself to pick him out of a line-up. \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"Homebodies\", Catherine and Warrick investigate a shooting death that at first looks like a homicide, but winds up being identified as a suicide.  What normally innocuous object or objects did the victim use to make his suicide look like murder?", "correct": "balloons", "options": ["marbles", "a swing set", "a squirt gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nballoons.\n\n\tFrank Maddox, a bounty hunter at the end of his rope, decided to kill himself, but in order to make it look like he was murdered, he tied helium-filled balloons to his gun, so that after he shot himself fatally, the gun literally floated away.  It landed miles away in a suburban neighborhood. \n"}, {"text": "Episode 4, \"Feeling the Heat\", contains perhaps the most tragic story of the season.  A young couple deliberately leaves their infant to die of heatstroke in a car, reasoning that this is a kinder death than the one they think is in store for him.  They believe that he has a particular genetic disorder.  Which one?", "correct": "Tay-Sachs Syndrome", "options": ["Coffin-Lowry Syndrome", "Smith-Magenis Syndrome", "Jackson-Weiss Syndrome"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTay-Sachs Syndrome.\n\n\tThe occasionally reliable www.wikipedia.org has this to say about Tay-Sachs Syndrome:  \"Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first six months of life. Then, as nerve cells become distended with fatty material, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities occurs. The child becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow. Muscles begin to atrophy and paralysis sets in. Death usually occurs between 2-5 years.\"\r The tragedy here is that, even though the infant's older sibling did die after a years-long battle with Tay-Sachs, the infant himself didn't even have the disease!  His parents panicked when a doctor suggested that the baby MIGHT have the disease.  As Catherine says to the parents at the end of the episode, \"You killed a perfectly healthy baby.\"  That's some chilling, horrific stuff. \n"}, {"text": "Warrick investigates the case of an overweight man found dead in his home in \"Feeling the Heat\".  What was the cause of death?", "correct": "electrocution", "options": ["starvation", "diabetic shock", "brain aneurysm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nelectrocution.\n\n\tWesley Jones was killed when a massive surge of electricity entered his body (via his bare foot, which was flat on the floor) and \"short-circuited\" his heart.  The energy surge exited his body via his hand, which was holding a telephone at the time.  Warrick initially thought that the exit point was the entry point, and theorized that the phone itself might have somehow killed the man! \n"}, {"text": "The infamous episode 5, \"Fur and Loathing\", gives us a peek into yet another subculture:  a group of people called \"Furries\" who derive pleasure from dressing up as cuddly animals and socializing as animals do.  The ball gets rolling when Grissom and Catherine discover the corpse of a man dressed in a \"Furry\" suit.  What kind of animal is he dressed as?", "correct": "raccoon", "options": ["cat", "dog", "rabbit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nraccoon.\n\n\tGrissom later learns that the deceased, Robert Pitt, went by the less-than-original name \"Rocky Raccoon\" in the \"Furry\" world. \n"}, {"text": "The writers of \"CSI\" made up the \"Furry\" subculture featured in the episode \"Fur and Loathing\".", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIt's the real deal, and it's been around a lot longer than \"CSI\"!  Check out http://www.tigerden.com/infopage/furry/ for an extensive list of links and details about \"Furries\". \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"Fur and Loathing\", Nick and Sara investigate a dead body found in a warehouse.  What's unusual about the body?", "correct": "It's frozen solid.", "options": ["It has no head.", "It's extremely bloated due to bacterial growth.", "It's been nailed to the floor."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's frozen solid.\n\n\tAl Sesto, the deceased, was fatally shot in what Nick calls \"the coldest place in Vegas\", a warehouse that apparently stores frozen goods.  Dr. Albert Robbins (Robert David Hall) and his team have to pour boiling water on the floor in order to melt the ice and extricate the corpse from the scene! \n"}, {"text": "Episode 6, \"Jackpot\", is unusual in that it focuses almost completely on a single member of the CSI team, working far from home and with very little assistance from the rest of the characters.  Who gets the spotlight in this episode?", "correct": "Gil Grissom", "options": ["Sara Sidle", "Catherine Willows", "Warrick Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGil Grissom.\n\n\tGrissom follows a lead to the small town of Jackpot, Nevada.  He winds up working a murder case almost entirely on his own...and, for a while, even without the use of his trusty field kit! \n"}, {"text": "\"Jackpot\" opens with Dr. Albert Robbins (Robert David Hall) opening a package that contains a human body part.  What is it?", "correct": "a head", "options": ["a foot", "a heart", "a hand"], "explanation": "\n\n\na head.\n\n\tGrissom spends the rest of this episode a) tracking down the body to which the head belongs, and b) determining why someone would kill a man in such a grisly manner. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following statements is NOT true about Ross Jensen, the victim in \"Jackpot\"?", "correct": "He was a resident of Jackpot, Nevada.", "options": ["He was a recreational drug user.", "He was a homosexual.", "He was murdered by his college roommate."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was a resident of Jackpot, Nevada.\n\n\tRoss (whose marijuana Jim Brass found during a search of his dorm room) was having an affair with the father of his roommate, Eric Brooks.  Eric found out about the affair and decided to kill Ross.\r While Eric and his father are natives of Jackpot, NV, it's made clear that Ross Jensen didn't meet the Brookses until he wound up rooming with Eric at college, so he apparently grew up somewhere else.\r Part II of this quiz is coming soon! \n"}]}
