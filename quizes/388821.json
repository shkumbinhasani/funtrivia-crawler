This is extremely unhelpful for Agent Cooper's investigation as he was looking to get a lot of information about Laura Palmer's death from Renault. \n"}, {"text": "This place is up north of the border\nWith many a video recorder\nThey noticed our Coop\nThe Hawk he did swoop\nTo save him from total disorder", "correct": "One-Eyed Jack's", "options": ["Big Ed's Gas Farm", "Horne's Department Store", "Silver Mustang Casino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne-Eyed Jack's.\n\n\tOne-Eyed Jack's is a brothel and casino owned by Ben Horne and located north of the Canadian border in British Columbia.
