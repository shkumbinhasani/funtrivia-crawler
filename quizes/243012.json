{"id": "243012", "name": "I Hate Blackberries! Quiz | Botany | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Botany", "Angiosperms and Gymnosperms"], "questions": [{"text": "The Himalayan blackberry has become a dreaded and despised weed across the world. Where have they not spread their spiky tendrils?", "correct": "Mexico", "options": ["Australia", "South Africa", "Chile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexico.\n\n\tHimalayan blackberry prefers wet soils, so the Pacific Northwest in the US has the most gigantic infestations. But many other areas and countries have been invaded as well, including New Zealand, Australia, South America, South Africa and parts of Asia. \n"}, {"text": "What area has the dubious honor of being the original home of the Himalayan blackberry? ", "correct": "Armenia", "options": ["Great Britain", "The Himalayas", "The Pacific Northwest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmenia.\n\n\tOne of several scientific names that has been given to the Himalayan blackberry is Rubus armeniacus, due to its origins. It's more often referred to as Rubus discolor, and occasionally Rubus procerus. \n"}, {"text": "Himalayan blackberry has many vices. Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Leaves are poisonous to livestock", "options": ["Crowds out native plants", "Dead canes are a fire hazard", "Blocks trails with impassable thickets"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeaves are poisonous to livestock.\n\n\tWhile blackberry leaves are not poisonous, they are not favored browse to livestock- except for goats, which relish them and are used to control blackberries. \r Himalayan blackberry aggressively outcompetes native plants and forms monocultures of acres of nothing but blackberries. These thickets are impenetrable by humans or large animals due to the wicked thorns on the canes (blackberry is a member of the rose family.)\r Blackberry canes only live about two years; thus a large infestation creates a huge amount of dried dead canes that can pose a fire hazard. \n"}, {"text": "Himalayan blackberries can quickly overtake an area. Which is NOT one of the ways that they can spread?", "correct": "Pieces of thorny cane become entangled in animal fur, fall out, and root", "options": ["Canes root wherever they touch the ground", "Roots send up suckers", "Animals eat the berries and spread the seeds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPieces of thorny cane become entangled in animal fur, fall out, and root.\n\n\tThe long canes of Himalayan blackberries can grow over 10 feet per year, rooting wherever they touch the ground. At the same time, the roots spread and send up suckers everywhere. And, of course, the bounty of tasty berries leads to animals being willing to spread the seeds far and wide, complete with an initial dose of fertilizer. \n"}, {"text": "In which habitat do Himalayan blackberries cause the most problems?", "correct": "Riparian areas near streams and rivers", "options": ["Old-growth forests", "Oak woodlands", "Native-grass prairies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiparian areas near streams and rivers.\n\n\tHimalayan blackberries are intolerant of shade, so are rarely problematic in old-growth forests (except in clearcut areas.) While they can grow in prairies and oak woodlands, they thrive best in the damp soil near rivers and streams. They quickly invade any areas where soil is disturbed as well. \n"}, {"text": "What misguided but famous individual was responsible for the invasion of Himalayan blackberry in the Pacific Northwest?", "correct": "Luther Burbank", "options": ["Meriwether Lewis", "George Washington", "William Clark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuther Burbank.\n\n\tIn 1885, Luther Burbank, the famed horticulturalist whose more sensible accomplishments included breeding freestone peaches and russet potatoes,  brought the blackberry over from Europe. Shame on him. As a fellow soldier in the war wrote in his blog, \"May Luther Burbank rot in his grave for unleashing this despicable vegetation upon our defenseless natives.\" (http://hinessight.blogs.com/hinessight/2004/11/index.html) \n"}, {"text": "In the past, ecologists actually recommended planting Himalayan blackberries in the Pacific Northwest.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs late as the 1980s, some state Departments of Natural Resources used them as a quick way to stabilize denuded streambanks. Now, the same departments are spending big bucks to try and eradicate them. \n"}, {"text": "Many weeds have natural controls- thing like bugs that eat them or diseases that plague them- that can be used to control them. Unfortunately for blackberry destroyers, natural controls for Himalayan blackberry are not available in the US, because of fears that they may infect cultivated blackberries. However, one natural control, scientifically known as Phragmidium violaceum, has been used in Australia and was discovered in 2005 on Himalayan blackberry in Oregon. What is Phragmidium violaceum?", "correct": "A fungal disease", "options": ["An insect", "A small mammal that eats blackberry leaves", "A bacterial disease"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA fungal disease.\n\n\tPhragmidium violaceum is a rust, a type of fungal organism that attacks plant leaves. It is called a \"rust\" because the affected spots look rusty. This disease was first found in the US in western Oregon in April of 2005.It is spreading through parts of Oregon and Washington. Despite the fears of commercial growers, cultivated berries seem to be immune to it. Results in Australia from the introduction of this disease have been mixed- some areas have reported good control while in others plants were little affected.It remains to be seen what the rust will do to Himalayan blackberries in the Pacific Northwest- here's to hoping that it socks 'em good! \n"}, {"text": "If you want to get rid of Himalayan blackberries, which method has the greatest chance of success?", "correct": "Cut them down after flowering, dig up all root crowns, and spray any shoots that emerge in the fall  with herbicides", "options": ["Burn them to the ground", "Cut them down with a brush mower", "Spray them with herbicide in the early spring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCut them down after flowering, dig up all root crowns, and spray any shoots that emerge in the fall  with herbicides.\n\n\tBlackberries sprout vigorously after being cut or burned, and outcompete any other species that was cut or burned at the same time. In order for herbicides to work, they must be transported to the roots to kill them. During the spring, all the nutrients in the plant are traveling out to the flowers, not to the roots. In order for herbicides to work well, they must be applied in the fall when the nutrients are being stored in the roots. However, cutting the plants down works best after flowering, when they have used up most of their resources. \n"}, {"text": "Do Himalayan blackberries have any benefits whatsoever to the environment?", "correct": "Yes, but they are outweighed by their deficits", "options": ["No, they are an utterly useless pox upon the face of the earth", "Only in their natural environment in their country of origin", "Yes, they really are pretty benign and on the whole do more good than harm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes, but they are outweighed by their deficits.\n\n\tSigh. The (insert expletive of your choice here) Himalayan blackberries do have some good points. Their fruit is really, really good; relished by human and animal alike. They do provide nesting cover for birds. Their roots help prevent erosion...in other words, they may be better than bare dirt. But the tremendous harm that they do to natural habitats cannot be overlooked, and there are native plants that can provide all of the benefits of blackberries with none of the deficits. \n"}]}
