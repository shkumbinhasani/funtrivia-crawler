{"id": "226925", "name": "A Quiz...BOND Quiz.... | Authors | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors D-G", " Ian Fleming"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"Goldfinger\", the novel, Pussy Galore had more character time than Tilly Masterson.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, Tilly Masterson, the sister of Jill Masterson, the girl who was painted gold as revenge for turning on Goldfinger in the card game cheat, had something like a half to two thirds of the novel length as a character. Pussy Galore, in fact, had only about two percent character time in the book.  She was one of the people recruited to help facilitate \"Operation Grandslam\" and was not an employee of Goldfinger's at _all_. She actually headed an aerialist troupe. The phrase, \"Pussy Galore's Flying Circus\", referred to her trapeze acrobats, not pilots.\r The recruiters? Tilly and 007 themselves! \n"}, {"text": "In \"You Only Live Twice\", Ernst Stavro Blofeld was the main villain, but what was so unusual about him in this novel?", "correct": "He wore medieval armor and had his wife accompany him just about everywhere", "options": ["He was without his angora cat for most of the novel", "His earlobes were surgically altered to look normal", "He was speculating on extinct volcano housing starts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wore medieval armor and had his wife accompany him just about everywhere.\n\n\tFor some odd reason, Fleming saw fit to have Blofeld wear medieval armor throughout this novel, as he traveled everywhere with his wife, while trying to corner the market in geothermal (geyser) power. The novel, \"YOLT\" bore VERY little resemblance to the movie, with only Tiger, Kissy Suzuki, Blofeld and the attempted poisoning of Bond that killed the _other_ Japanese girl instead, (as well  as the heavy/light cargo ship quandary,) as shared plot points. \r Bond was also made up to look Japanese in both the novel and movie. Volcanoes and missiles, prominent in the movie, did _not_ figure heavily in the novel. \n"}, {"text": "How was Dr. No dressed, initially, in the novel bearing his name?", "correct": "In traditional Chinese robe, with long fingernails.", "options": ["In a very elegant Saville Row suit, with pinstripes", "In a Nehru jacket mit der prosthetic hand, just like in the movie", "In hospital scrubs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn traditional Chinese robe, with long fingernails.\n\n\tDr. No was described as being in a Chinese robe that ended just above the floor, giving him the illusion of \"floating\" over the floor as he walked. The description was very reminiscent of the classic \"Fu Manchu\", Machiavellian oriental villain. \n"}, {"text": "What car is Tilly driving when she runs into 007 in \"Goldfinger\"?", "correct": "A Triumph TR-2", "options": ["An MG-A", "What else, the Mustang!", "An AC Ace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Triumph TR-2.\n\n\tYep...a garden variety, ugly as sin Triumph TR-2, which was essentially an earlier incarnation of the familiar TR-3 with an odd looking grille. Bond first notices the car in a traffic jam, and is struck when he sees it again later, with Tilly M., its foxy driver. \n"}, {"text": "What was the original plotline to \"Octopussy\", a short story whose title graced the confused Roger Moore travesty co-starring Maud Adams and Louis Jordan?", "correct": "A man trying to retrieve  WWII gold booty he stashed in  the Alps years earlier", "options": ["Bond takes on AT&T, Microsoft and Unilever", "Bond nails an evil arch-villainess with eight legs", "Bond smashes an oil cartel larger than OPEC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA man trying to retrieve  WWII gold booty he stashed in  the Alps years earlier.\n\n\t\"Octopussy\", a short story written shortly before Ian Fleming died, was about an English vet who had hidden some Nazi gold in the Alps, committing murder to keep others from getting it. \"Octopussy\" was the name of his pet octopus. \r This story bore _zero_ resemblance to the Roger Moore film, something not unusual for Moore's run, where only \"Live and Let Die\" took any real cues from the book that the film sprang from. \"For Your Eyes Only\", for instance, was a very serious spy mission concerning UN couriers being ambushed on the central west coastal area of Europe. The _movie_ bears a strong resemblance to \"From Russia With Love\" mixed with \"Lolita\"!\r The \"Octopussy\" film bore a strong resemblance to \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and \"Thunderball\", what with villainess Octopussy's harem of young women (!), the Faberge Egg angle and the nuclear blackmail.\r Roger Moore's run of Bond films, while the longest, time-period-wise, was easily the worst, in my opinion. Most of the movies, in fact, were jumbled versions of earlier Bond films. \"View To A Kill\", in fact, was essentially \"Goldfinger\" re-created almost verbatim. \n"}, {"text": "How was Dr. No disposed of in the novel, as opposed to the film?", "correct": "Bond dumps cormorant guano on him with a steamshovel", "options": ["Dr. No commits hari-kari after Bond topples his operation", "Bond gets him in a headlock, he turns blue, and faints", "Honey decks him by hitting him on the head with a large conch shell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBond dumps cormorant guano on him with a steamshovel.\n\n\tYep. Can you believe that? If they had filmed that ending for the movie, it would have borne a _very_ strong resemblance to one of the many Bond parodies that followed \"Goldfinger\" and \"Thunderball\". \n"}, {"text": "Which actor, who portrayed Ernst Stavro Blofeld, resembled Fleming's description of him the most?", "correct": "Telly Savalas", "options": ["Charles Gray", "Donald Pleasance", "Max Von Sydow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelly Savalas.\n\n\tSavalas, who played the character in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", had the right combination of features that Fleming describes in the novel \"Thunderball\". Blofeld's pupils were described as \"Deep black pools surrounded...TOTALLY surrounded...\" by the whites of the eyes, (Savalas had very prominent pupils.) This was a phrase used by Fleming to describe Bond's recurring arch-nemesis. \r Pleasance was probably cast for his smarmimness, in \"YOLT\" and Gray for his pomposity, in \"Diamonds Are Forever\". Von Sydow probably was because he was the only one who hadn't PLAYED him yet...(In \"Never Say Never Again\", yet another rehash of \"Thunderball\".)\r In the first two Bond films, \"Dr. No\" and \"From Russia With Love\" and the fourth, (you guessed it,) \"Thunderball\", Blofeld was heard but his face never seen, usually stroking the fur of his angora cat, with a voice-over that sounded, in fact, a lot like Von Sydow. \n"}, {"text": "Which novel was Bond married in?", "correct": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", "options": ["The Living Daylights", "You Only Live Twice", "The Man With The Golden Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn Her Majesty's Secret Service.\n\n\tTracy Di Vicenzo (Draco), played by Diana Rigg in the movie, is the daughter of a crime boss who also happens to be minor European royalty. At the end of the novel, she is killed by Blofeld's wife while she and Bond are on their way to their honeymoon. \n"}, {"text": "Where does the novel \"Live and Let Die\" take place?", "correct": "In New York City , St. Petersburg, Fla. and Jamaica", "options": ["New York City, Oslo and Venice", "New York City, New Orleans and St. Moritz", "New York City, Cardiff and Instanbul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn New York City , St. Petersburg, Fla. and Jamaica\n\n\tAnother novel altered for the screen, \"L&LD\" originally had the plot of Mr. Big running yet another Fleming gold hoarding scheme to finance cold war Soviet spy operations. Seventeenth century antique gold coins are used. Felix Leiter, as he is in the film \"License To Kill\" by Franz Sanchez's gunsels, is critically injured by Mr. Big's henchmen in the novel. \r In the film, \"Mr. Big\" (Katanga) was a heroin trafficker, and the film largely resembled a \"blaxploitation\" flick. This was Roger Moore's first outing as Bond, and was ridiculous from the very start. The ending featured Mr. Big, played by Yaphet Kotto, being blown up by swallowing a small nodule of highly compressed gas. The jump cut to a dummy was obvious, perhaps rightly so, but it still put the topping on what was the first in a long line of truly ridiculous Bond movies starring Moore. If you'll notice, in the highway chase scene near the beginning of the movie, just about every other car _on_ the highway, except for the pimpmobiles, is a Chevy Impala or Caprice. A precursor to \"Batman Returns\", perhaps?\r A collective sigh of relief must have gone up among Bond fandom when Moore announced his retirement from the role. I know most movie critics were probably relieved. \n"}, {"text": "What was similar about \"Dr. No\" and \"You Only Live Twice\", as far as water is concerned?", "correct": "They both have scenes near the end  that involve 007 frantically avoiding being drowned by water rushing  through conduits", "options": ["They both have Blofeld parading around in scuba gear for a good portion of the stories", "There are piranha figuring heavily in both stories", "Bond's clothes shrink when exposed to water vapor from hot springs in both stories"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey both have scenes near the end  that involve 007 frantically avoiding being drowned by water rushing  through conduits.\n\n\tIn \"You Only Live Twice\", near the end, Bond is in a stunned state, trying hard to avoid being waterlogged by geyser eruptions in an aqueduct, as he is in \"Dr. No\", but by sewage and used hot water rushing through pipes.\r Some tense moments in both the novels _and_ the movies! \n"}, {"text": "How did Oddjob die in \"Goldfinger?", "correct": "_He_ was the one sucked out of the airplane near the end", "options": ["Electrocuted, just like in the movie", "He fell off the top of Fort Knox", "Bond shied his own lethal bowler at him"], "explanation": "\n\n\n_He_ was the one sucked out of the airplane near the end.\n\n\tYep! _Oddjob_ was the one sucked out of the airplane near the end, _not_ Goldfinger! The imbroglio in Fort Knox didn't go the way it did in the movie. Oddjob survived to attack Bond on the plane, wrestling with him for possession of a gun, which, as in the film, blasts a plane window open, drawing Oddjob through it. Goldfinger, in fact, was strangled by Bond, who used his own bare hands, soon after. \n"}, {"text": "What bothersome, temporary illness afflicted Bond in \"You Only Live Twice\"?", "correct": "Amnesia", "options": ["Tetanus", "Chickenpox", "Aphasia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmnesia.\n\n\tAt the very end of the novel, after Blofeld is disposed of, the stress of the preceding adventure gives Bond a bout of amnesia, with the novel ending there. Presumably Kissy will \"re-educate\" him, giving him \"very _best_ duck\"! \n"}, {"text": "Who actually told Bond about Auric Goldfinger's systematic card cheating?", "correct": "A man named Junius Du Pont", "options": ["His old CIA buddy, Felix Leiter", "Miss Moneypenny", "\"M\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nA man named Junius Du Pont.\n\n\tJunius Du Pont, a man who had run into Bond once before while he was in the casino in \"Casino Royale\" playing baccarat against a Frenchman named \"La Chiffre\", ran into him again in an airport in the Caribbean while he was on his way to New York after an assignment. He had him pegged as an intelligence man, and had dabbled in the field himself, post-war! He told Bond about Goldfinger, and about being rooked out of tens of thousands of dollars by him. He _knew_ he was cheating, but couldn't prove it! This piqued Bond's interest in a man he had, until then, never heard of. \n"}, {"text": "What organization was funding Goldfinger's operation?", "correct": "SMERSH", "options": ["The KGB", "The Red Chinese government", "North Korea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSMERSH.\n\n\tYes, Goldfinger was working for the Russians, as a member of SMERSH, an actual organization formed in Russia in 1943 as a counterintelligence agency to take care of traitors, spies and troublemakers. Its name means \"Death to spies\". \n"}, {"text": "What Bond novel had scenes of suspected Sapphic admiration between two of the female characters?", "correct": "Goldfinger", "options": ["From Russia With Love", "Dr. No", "Diamonds Are Forever"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoldfinger.\n\n\tIn the novel, near the end, when \"Operation Grandslam\" is in full swing, Tilly Masterson casts somewhat obvious, admiring glances at Pussy Galore whenever she encounters her. Bond takes note of it and comments to himself about it! T'is a pity, since he had been plotting a way to get into her pants _himself_! \n"}]}
