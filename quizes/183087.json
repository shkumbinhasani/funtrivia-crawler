{"id": "183087", "name": "Human Prehistory Quiz | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "    Pre-History"], "questions": [{"text": "Recorded human history can safely be said to have begun around the time when people discovered different methods of writing.  Prior to the advent of writing, human beings still created objects from stone, wood, etc.  Which of these is not a method of deciphering the age of these prehistoric objects and/or human remains?  ", "correct": "Mantoux Test", "options": ["Potassium-Argon Dating", "Radiocarbon Dating", "Dendrochronology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMantoux Test.\n\n\tDendrochronology is the science of dating using tree rings.  It's useful for dating some objects as far back as about 9000 B.C.  For objects ranging up to about 40,000 years old radiocarbon dating (C-14) is used.  Objects between 40,000 and 500,000 years old are difficult to date using current methods, but for objects older than 500,000 years the potassium-argon test is used.  The Mantoux text is given to people who are suspected of being immune to tuberculosis. \n"}, {"text": "Christian Jurgensen Thomson developed his famous 'Three Age System' for subdividing human prehistory in 1806.  Which of these was not an 'age' in Thomson's system? ", "correct": "Silver Age", "options": ["Iron Age", "Stone Age", "Bronze Age"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilver Age.\n\n\tC. J. Thomson, a Danish archaeologist, subdivided human prehistory into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, respectively.  The Stone Age was further subdivided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) and Neolithic (New Stone Age). \n"}, {"text": "The last glaciation of the most recent Ice Age is sometimes referred to by the name of what river in Europe?  ", "correct": "W\u00fcrm", "options": ["Elbe", "Dneiper", "Po"], "explanation": "\n\n\nW\u00fcrm.\n\n\tThe W\u00fcrm, or Wisconsin, Glaciation began its retreat about 15,000 years ago, but not before human beings would cross the Bering Strait from Asia into the Americas.  During the most recent Ice Age, the Neanderthals, a people especially suited for cold weather, flourished in Europe.  The term 'W\u00fcrm' comes from a river in Switzerland at which the glaciation was first discovered. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these individuals first identified a member of the early hominid species known as Australopithecus?  ", "correct": "Raymond Dart", "options": ["Willard Libby", "Vincent Sarich", "A. E. Douglass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaymond Dart.\n\n\tDart was an anatomy professor who, while exploring the Taung limestone quarry in Bechuanaland found a tiny skull which he identified as an early hominid, rather than an ape.   After naming the species Autralopithecus africanus, he announced his discovery to the public, but his findings were met with extreme skepticism and derision.  Another scholar, Robert Broom, believed Dart and left for Africa where he made his own discoveries that corroborated Dart's claims. \n"}, {"text": "The Leakey family is responsible for some of the most famous archaeological finds known to us.  Louis Leakey was the patriarch of the family, and has become known as 'The Old Man of __________' because of his many discoveries at a certain location.  Which of these fits the blank?\n", "correct": "Olduvai Gorge", "options": ["Makgadikgadi Salt Pan", "Nubian Desert", "Lake Victoria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlduvai Gorge.\n\n\tIt was in the bed of the Olduvai Gorge, in the midst of the Serengeti Plain in northern Tanzania, where the Louis first discovered stone tools in 1931.  Louis Leakey also discovered the first sample of Homo habilis in the Olduvai Gorge. \n"}, {"text": "The earliest evidence of toolmaking was found at a site on the east side of Lake Turkana which has been given what name?  ", "correct": "Koobi Fora", "options": ["Clovis", "Tashik Tash", "Svartkrans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKoobi Fora.\n\n\tThe Koobi Fora has yielded finds that have been dated to about 2.5 million years ago.  The tools found at the Koobi Fora, located in eastern Africa, were most likely employed by members of the species Homo habilis.  The Leakeys, among many others, have been active at this site for decades. \n"}, {"text": "Which early race of hominids was given the name 'handy man' because of their ability to use tools and other implements?  ", "correct": "Homo habilis & Homo Habilus", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomo habilis & Homo Habilus.\n\n\tHomo habilis literally means 'handy man', and as described above, was likely the first of the hominid species to employ tools, mostly using stone and wood in constructing simple instruments that could be used for hunting, cooking and other activities related to daily life. \n"}, {"text": "Eugene Dubois was a Dutch physician who set out in the 1890s to find remains of early humanoids.  He located the first example of what he called 'Pithecanthropus erectus', also known as Homo erectus, on what island in 1891?  ", "correct": "Java", "options": ["Celebes", "Borneo", "New Guinea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJava.\n\n\tThe discovery of Dubois' 'Javan Man' was originally treated with great skepticism, much as Dart's discovery some years later.  Dubois initially believed his discovery to be 'the missing link' between man and ape, but we now know that Homo erectus is but a small piece of a greater puzzle.  It was not until the 1920s that the scientific community fully accepted Dubois' discovery, and this only after similar human remains were discovered in China. \n"}, {"text": "In what country can the famous Zhoukoudian Cave be found, where a great many remains of the species Homo erectus have been discovered?  ", "correct": "China", "options": ["Mongolia", "India", "Russia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChina.\n\n\tZhoukoudian Cave in northern China is the site where the famous 'Peking Man' was first discovered.  It was this discovery that helped convince the world of the veracity of Dubois' claims.  The fascinating story of Zhoukoudian, now a World Heritage Site, can be found at the following webpage: http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is the name of a cave wherein tools have been found that were employed by the Neanderthals?  ", "correct": "Le Moustier", "options": ["Ajanta", "Karst", "Diros"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLe Moustier.\n\n\tPerhaps the most revealing find in relations to Neanderthal tool-making was the discovery of the Mousterian technology at the Le Moustier cave in the south of France.  Remains of the Neanderthals, originally located at a cave in the Neander Valley near D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany, have been found across Europe.  The Neanderthals were the first hominid group to bury their dead, and probably developed the first form of systematic spirituality.
