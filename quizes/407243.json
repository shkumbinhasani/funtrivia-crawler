{"id": "407243", "name": "\"The Amazing Race 29\" [3] Quiz | Amazing Race | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "Teams departed from Tanzania in Leg 5 and headed five thousand miles north to what Norwegian city?", "correct": "\u00c5lesund", "options": ["Trondheim", "Begern", "Oslo"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\u00c5lesund.\n\n\tOpening their clue on Coco Beach in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, teams were instructed to travel into Europe's northern reaches to the city of \u00c5lesund, Norway on the edge of the Norwegian Sea.  Arriving the next day, they could drive themselves to the water's edge to H\u00f8gsteinen Fyr Lighthouse to complete their first task-- eating a full serving of rakfisk (long-fermented fish) would result in their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The only Fast Forward of the race was collected by which of these teams?", "correct": "Becca and Floyd", "options": ["Tara and Joey", "Matt and Redmond", "Liz and Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecca and Floyd.\n\n\tFinishing their rakfisk, teams opened their clue to find the race's only Fast Forward, and it required a leap of faith in more ways than one.  Only one team would be able to take a nearby helicopter to a mystery location, Geirangerfjord, where they would be suited up and told that they would need to perform a 10,000ft tandem skydive from a helicopter over the fjord to be able to skip all tasks and go directly to their next Pit Stop. Becca and Floyd completed this task, nulling out the need for them to use their Express Pass before the deadline at the end of this leg.  Interestingly, however, they placed third. \n"}, {"text": "During the Leg 5 Road Block, team members climbed up a structure meant to be which of these?", "correct": "Bonfire", "options": ["Radio tower", "Apartment building", "Playground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBonfire.\n\n\tThe six teams that did not pursue the Fast Forward instead drove themselves to Slinningen, Norway for a unique Road Block opportunity in which one member of each pair needed to get into a harness and climb a tower of pallets built thirteen storeys high on the waterfront.  At the top they would need to take a provided pallet and hammer it to the pile in an attempt to help the locals beat their hand-stacked bonfire tower record.  Matt, Joey, Ashton, Scott, London, and Liz rose to the top and completed this challenge. \n"}, {"text": "Which Detour task was completed by more teams in Norway in Leg 5?", "correct": "'Trolls'", "options": ["'Troll'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Trolls'.\n\n\tFinishing their Road Block task, teams were given the unique Detour choice of 'Trolls' or 'Troll', both of which took teams back into Downtown \u00c5lesund.  In 'Trolls', teams had to collect a map and a scroll containing a Norwegian poem.  Then, visiting six locations on the map, they would have to recite the poem and collect oversized fireworks which, when returned, would allow teams to get their Pit Stop destination. In 'Troll', teams instead hopped into kayaks and searched the Brosundet Canal for one of a handful of red and yellow fishing lures containing the name of their next destination.  'Trolls' was done by Vanck and Ashton, London and Logan, Brooke and Scott, and Liz and Michael; 'Troll' was for Matt and Redmond and Tara and Joey. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was last to arrive at the Pit Stop in Leg 5?", "correct": "Liz and Michael", "options": ["London and Logan", "Brooke and Scott", "Vanck and Ashton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiz and Michael.\n\n\tOnce people grabbed their key word they could race onward and upward, by any means, to the lookout point atop Mount Aksla to find Phil and the race's fifth Pit Stop.  Though Becca and Floyd completed the Fast Forward and had an Express Pass in their back pocket, it was Tara and Joey who managed to reach the mat in first place.  Fortunately, all seven teams were told to keep on racing, which meant that last place duo Liz and Michael were spared from elimination and were allowed to rip open their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "To start Leg 6, teams had to travel to what Italian city?", "correct": "Milan", "options": ["Rome", "Turin", "Naples"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilan.\n\n\tTeams dove directly into Leg 6, taking off from the Pit Stop at the top of Mount Aksla with a smartphone and booking flights to Milan, Italy via the Travelocity mobile app.  This meant that teams needed to take a train to Oslo, then fly to the North Italian travel hub (via London) to get their next clue.  Upon landing in Milan, teams had to travel to Piazza Fontana, a block over from the Duomo di Milano, to find their clue box waiting for them.  Teams were warned, as well, that there would be a Double U-Turn ahead. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these did team members need to eat during the Road Block in Leg 6?", "correct": "Gnocchi", "options": ["Tiramisu", "Pizza", "Spaghetti"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGnocchi.\n\n\tReaching Milan, Italy late in the evening, teams found their Road Block waiting at Piazza Fontana.  Here, one member of each team needed to enjoy a meal on the ATMosfera Tram Ristorante, a streetcar restaurant taking a circuit around Milan's historical city center.  Tara, Michael, Vanck, Redmond, Scott, Floyd, and Logan had to eat parmigiana melanzane and a bowl of gnocchi while looking for three different marked words on the tram route: Cernobbio, Concordia, and Lago. If they could name all three, they would get their next clue, otherwise they'd have to take the circuit...and the meal...all over again. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was the only one forced to complete both sides of the Detour in Italy in Leg 6 (as per the Double U-Turn board)?", "correct": "Vanck and Ashton", "options": ["Becca and Floyd", "Matt and Redmond", "Liz and Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVanck and Ashton.\n\n\tFinishing the Road Block, teams headed to Cernobbio on the shores of Lake Como.  Taking an early morning steamship across the lake to the Varenna Ferry Terminal, teams started their day with a visit to the Double U-Turn board in Greenway dei Patriarchi.  Set before the Detour, this gave teams the chance to force two other teams to complete both sides of the Detour. In a severe social move, Liz and Michael U-Turned Vanck and Ashton while Becca and Floyd intentionally U-Turned Liz and Michael, who'd already passed, to burn the board for the other teams.  It meant that only Vanck and Ashton had to overcome both choices. \n"}, {"text": "Though one team was forced to complete both sides of the Detour in Leg 6, Tara and Joey and London and Logan were also the only ones who chose to complete which task?", "correct": "'Make a Mold'", "options": ["'Grab a Hold'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Make a Mold'.\n\n\tOnce teams dealt with the U-Turn board, they broke into their Detour clues.  In 'Make a Mold', teams headed to Castello di Vezio and created a local art piece, letting a wire and plaster mold set over one of their bodies to mimic a ghost.  Once the plaster set they could collect their next clue.  Only Tara and Joey chose to complete this task while all the rest chose 'Grab a Hold', which required that they divide and conquer a climbing challenge.  While one team member climbed up a 90-foot rock face at L'Angolo Benedetto Castelli, the other belayed. \n"}, {"text": "Which team was eliminated in Italy at the end of Leg 6?", "correct": "Vanck and Ashton", "options": ["Brooke and Scott", "Liz and Michael", "London and Logan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVanck and Ashton.\n\n\tAs teams completed the Detour, they needed to hop aboard a Riva Aquarama and head to the town of Tremezzo on the Lake Como coast.  There, they could check into the sixth Pit Stop of the race at Teresio Olivelli Park on the edge of the water.  Becca and Floyd, excelling in a climbing challenge due to Becca's profession as a rock climbing instructor and beating Matt and Redmond in a footrace, managed to nab their first first place win, bagging a trip for two to Ushuaia, Argentina courtesy of Travelocity. Ultimately, the calculated Double U-Turn spelled doom for Vanck and Ashton; the other teams' concerted efforts forced them into last place and they were eliminated from the race. \n"}]}
