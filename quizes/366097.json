{"id": "366097", "name": "\"LEGO: Lord of the Rings\" Abilities Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Lego Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Without using any treasure items, only one of the nine characters of the Fellowship is able to start a fire. With the aid of the tinderbox, which of the following characters is able to create a flame (upon some of which he also is able to cook meals)?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Merry", "Pippin", "Frodo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tSamwise Gamgee, a Hobbit, has both a spade and a tinderbox, allowing him to dig and create fires. Throughout the game, there are places where any character may start a fire; they can find a torch and dip it in an existing fire to create a new one elsewhere. However, only Sam may create such a fire with his tinderbox.\r Sam can also pull on certain things using his Elven rope, which he acquires throughout the game. Interestingly, not even Legolas can do this without using a special treasure item. \n"}, {"text": "If you come across cracked rocks, one certain player can come in handy. With his mighty axe, he is able to smash through these surfaces. Which of the Fellowship would you enlist to break through these rocks (without using any treasure items)?", "correct": "Gimli", "options": ["Aragorn", "Legolas", "Gandalf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGimli.\n\n\tGimli the Dwarf has the ability to smash through certain walls and cracks in the floor using his axe. Sometimes the cracked surfaces contain bonuses, such as extra studs or special treasures. Other times, the only way to advance is by smashing obstacles blocking the path. Gimli can also be thrown by certain characters towards certain rocks that are out of his reach (but don't tell the elf). \n"}, {"text": "Dark places often contain many wonderful treasures, including mithril bricks and certain treasures. Unfortunately, most every character is afraid of the dark, and you must enlist one specific character to travel these dark crevices. Which of these can use his Phial of Galadriel to enter these spooky spots?", "correct": "Frodo", "options": ["Pippin", "Sam", "Merry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrodo.\n\n\tFrodo Baggins is, of course, a Hobbit and the main character of the \"Lord of the Ring\" series, as well as the \"LEGO\" video game. He has a few abilities unique to himself. He can use his Phial of Galadriel to light up dark paths, though this is not an ability he has from the start. He acquires it later on, and he also receives an Elven cloak that allows him to turn invisible, which is especially helpful when the Nazgul (Ringwraiths) are near. Bilbo also gives him a special mithril vest that allows him to take eight hearts of damage instead of the normal four before he dies. \n"}, {"text": "Morgul blocks appear throughout the game as black and red items that no character seems to be able to break. One is able to do so (without equipping special items), but not until very late in the game when he acquires a new sword, Anduril. Which of these characters can break these special blocks after he receives Anduril?", "correct": "Aragorn", "options": ["Gandalf", "Gimli", "Legolas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAragorn.\n\n\tWhile playing the very first level, the \"Prologue\", two of the characters are able to break Morgul blocks. They are Elendil and Isuldur. Unfortunately, they are not of the Fellowship, and Morgul blocks can therefore not be destroyed for much of the game. When Aragorn (who is a human character) receives his sword, Anduril, he is able to destroy the Morgul blocks with it. \n"}, {"text": "It is possible to go fishing with a few different characters throughout the game, but only one can do so at any time, as he carries his fishing rod with him wherever he goes. Without having to equip any treasure items, which of these characters can fish for treasure?", "correct": "Merry", "options": ["Pippin", "Sam", "Frodo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMerry.\n\n\tMeriadoc Brandybuck is one of the four Hobbits who make up the Fellowship of the Ring. He carries a barrow-blade as well as a fishing rod. Merry is the only one able to fish without equipping any special treasure items. If you fish perfectly and wait for the ring to touch the required button to press, you can even get a bonus. \n"}, {"text": "Fire can often block the path to certain bonuses or even the way you must take. One character, fortunately for you, carries a water bucket with him wherever he goes. He can scoop of water from certain locations and pour it onto the fire so you may pass. Which of these characters has this ability?", "correct": "Pippin", "options": ["Merry", "Frodo", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPippin.\n\n\tPeregrin Took (the Hobbit known as Pippin) carries a water bucket with him, and it can (and does) come in handy on several occasions as you try to put out fires (I blame Sam and his tinderbox for the fires). Of course, this isn't to say that other characters cannot do the same. Many characters can equip treasure items to give them this ability, and in one level, while following Gollum through the marsh, both Sam and Frodo have the option of finding a bucket so they may put out fires in the marsh.\r Pippin is, however, the only one with the ability to carry water permanently, without the use of treasures. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes, in order to move on to the next location, or get to a special area high above, you need to create a staircase out of LEGO pieces. One character is able to use these blocks to create a staircase to allow the characters to reach the high area. It takes a magic touch for which of these to turn the blocked path into a block path?", "correct": "Gandalf", "options": ["Gimli", "Aragorn", "Legolas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGandalf.\n\n\tGandalf is first met as Gandalf the Grey (his hair and outfit are both grey), and, being a wizard, he possesses magic abilities. Not only can he magically move pricks to create staircases, he is also able to create a shield around himself and others to prevent damage from attacks. He later falls to his presumed death, but is later reunited with the rest as Gandalf the White (though he is at first thought to be Saruman, when Treebeard the Ent refers to him as \"the white wizard\"). \n"}, {"text": "Some places can only be reached by a skilled jumper, and one character from the Fellowship can jump higher than the rest. He can also walk across tightropes that others would not quite be balanced enough to navigate, and he can use his weapon to create a new path for him to travel. Which of the companions is able to do these things without the assistance of special treasure pieces?", "correct": "Legolas", "options": ["Aragorn", "Gimli", "Gandalf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLegolas.\n\n\tLegolas is an Elf, and as an Elf he possesses several abilities that the other characters couldn't dream of! For one, an Elf is extremely nimble, so Legolas can walk effortlessly on tightropes and jump higher than most. He can also use his mad archery skills to create a new way to get across large gaps; he can swing from arrow to arrow to land on the other side of an otherwise impassable chasm. His bow and arrow is also useful to hit certain targets that the other eight characters cannot reach, as Legolas is the only one with a long distance weapon. \n"}, {"text": "One thing often encountered in a \"LEGO\" video game is something known as the \"shorty door\". These doors can only be used by the smaller characters, as they are the only ones who could fit through the small spaces. The four Hobbits are all able to use these doors, but there is one other character from the Fellowship who is able to use these as well. Who is it?", "correct": "Gimli", "options": ["Aragorn", "Legolas", "Boromir"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGimli.\n\n\tSince Gimli is a Dwarf, he is short enough to enter through these special doors. This is necessary in several instances; on the \"Pass of Caradhras\", for example, Gimli must be carried across high snow (shorter characters cannot travel across without assistance), enter the short door, and smash the cracked floor to create an avalanche. This reduces the deep snow to allow the rest to move on as well.\r Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin can all enter these doors as well, as Hobbits are generally a short race. \n"}, {"text": "None of the primary nine characters are able to climb LEGO walls, so it is not until a new characters joins the team that you are able to reach certain areas. Which of these additional characters that are later added is the one who is able to climb walls?", "correct": "Gollum", "options": ["Arwen", "Eowyn", "Shagrat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGollum.\n\n\tGollum is able to climb certain walls that no other character can. You can typically identify these special walls by the fish skeletons found embedded in them. Gollum is first added to the group after he has been defeated by Sam and Frodo, but cannot be played until much later (I will say, it is quite discouraging to pass walls Gollum can climb while he is with you but unplayable). \n"}]}
