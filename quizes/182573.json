{"id": "182573", "name": "The Most Important 'R' People Quiz | Mixed People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", " Mixed People", " People by Surname"], "questions": [{"text": "The first notable dynasty in Russia's long history was named after this man who was probably of Swedish origin but could just as well have been Danish.  We are, of course, speaking about...?\n", "correct": "Rurik", "options": ["Romany", "Rubliac", "Russom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRurik.\n\n\tRurik (also spelled Riurik or R\u00f6rek) was a Viking, but whether he originally came from Sweden or Denmark is in dispute.  What we do know is that in 862 AD he came to control Novgorod and established the first dynasty in what is now modern day Russia.  He and his followers formed the Rurik Dynasty and were succeeded by the Kievan Rus, a proto-state that was the precursor to future Russian states.  The name Russia is derived from the followers of Rurik. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most notable presidents of the United States was Ronald Wilson Reagan.  Is it true that Ronald Reagan won the presidency on his first attempt at the office?  ", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tRonald Reagan, who was elected as president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947, and elected as governor of California in 1966, failed on his first attempt to run for president of the United States in 1968 (and again in 1976).  He was eventually elected in 1980 and served two terms.  Many attribute the end of the Cold War largely to Reagan's efforts, and he is given much credit for helping to revive the U.S. economy in the 1980s.  Critics argue that Reagan's policies were reckless because huge deficits were accrued during his time in office and scandals such as the Iran-Contra Affair and the Savings and Loan debacle occurred under his watch.  The debate continues, but no doubt Reagan's legacy will be considered significant by historians, no matter how they view it. \n"}, {"text": "Ernest Rutherford was one of the most important scientists of the early 20th century.  In which country was he born in 1871?  ", "correct": "New Zealand", "options": ["South Africa", "Australia", "Canada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Zealand.\n\n\tRutherford was a British physicist, born in New Zealand.  He made a very significant impact on our understanding of both radiation and nuclear physics.  Rutherford's 'Theory of Radioactivity' (co-authored by Frederick Soddy) in 1903, and his discoveries of the atomic nucleus and the orbital nature of atoms eventually garnered for him a Nobel Prize for Chemistry.  Rutherford is sometimes called the Father of Nuclear Physics. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most important figures of science in the medieval Islamic world was this doctor, philosopher and chemist who lived from 864 to 930 A.D.  What was his Latin name?  ", "correct": "Rhazes", "options": ["Regiomontanus", "Rufus", "Rashidius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhazes.\n\n\tRhazes could possibly have been the most important figure of Islamic science during the Middle Ages.  Not only did he carry on the traditions of Greco-Roman learning (which were eventually transferred back to Europe during the late Middle Ages) he made a number of significant contributions to the sciences of chemistry and medicine.  Rhazes first identified the diseases Smallpox and Asthma, and was the first author of a book on immunology.  Rhazes also published important works on medical ethics and the use of natural treatments.  He discovered sulfuric acid, and was the first to employ alcohol in medical practice.  His other accomplishments are innumerable, so I leave it to you to read more about him! \n"}, {"text": "Which noted British chemist was the discoverer of helium and the rest of the noble gases? ", "correct": "Ramsay", "options": ["Rumford", "Reid", "Richter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRamsay.\n\n\tRamsay, following the recommendations of his colleague Lord Rayleigh (who also might deserve to be included in this quiz), discovered the existence of argon in 1894.  Soon afterward, he isolated helium, krypton and xenon; the family of ideal, or noble, gases was discovered.  For this noble feat he was awarded a Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1904. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most significant of the many pharaohs of ancient Egypt was Ramses II.  Which great battle against the Hittites occurred during his reign?  ", "correct": "Kadesh", "options": ["Amphipolis", "Neon", "Cyzicus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKadesh.\n\n\tThe Battle of Kadesh (1286 B.C.) was considered a high point of Ramses the II's early reign, though ironically the Hittites got the better of the Egyptians in that battle (despite Egyptian attempts to claim otherwise).  During Ramses II's reign, Egypt likely reached its highest point, expanding into Libya and Nubia and stabilizing relations with the Hittites.  Ramses II's reign was characterized by the building of more major projects than any other pharaoh, including the complex at Abu Simbel and the columned hall at Karnak.  He has left an indelable legacy for Egyptologists. \n"}, {"text": "A key figure in the field of economics, he is considered to be the co-founder of the 'classical school'.  To whom am I referring?  ", "correct": "Ricardo", "options": ["Roberts", "Rankin", "Rhodes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRicardo.\n\n\tDavid Ricardo lived from 1772 to 1823, and during his life made huge contributions to the field of economics.  Ricardo published his 'Principles of Political Economy and Taxation' in 1817, therein establishing such famous concepts as the 'iron law of wages' and 'comparative advantage'.  His theory on the 'surplus value of labor' influenced Karl Marx, and his ideas in general helped pave the for modern thinking in the discipline. \n"}, {"text": "This German was the discoverer of x-rays and the first winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics.  Which of these names fits the description?  ", "correct": "Roentgen", "options": ["Remak", "Ruhmkorff", "Roemer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoentgen.\n\n\tWilhelm Conrad Roentgen (or more precisely R\u00f6ntgen) lived from 1845 to 1923.  In 1895, while doing some experiments with cathode rays Roentgen discovered x-rays.  His discovery electrified (no pun intended...well, maybe some pun) the field of physics, and in a few brief years Becquerel and the Curies were to make their famous discoveries in the field of radiation after being inspired by Roentgen.  For his efforts, Roentgen was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901, the first such prize.  He humbly donated his award money to the University of W\u00fcrzburg. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite philosophers, and one of the most important in history, was a certain Rousseau (1712-1778), who authored such works as 'The Social Contract'.  What was Rousseau's given name?  ", "correct": "Jean-Jacques", "options": ["Eug\u00e8ne", "Henri", "Th\u00e9odore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean-Jacques.\n\n\tEug\u00e8ne, Henri, Th\u00e9odore are also famous Rousseaus, but all were artists.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the famed philosopher who wrote 'The Social Contract' among other highly influential philosophical works.  In his works he discovered the concept of the 'noble savage' and announced that 'man is born free, but everywhere is in chains'.  His ideas greatly affected both the American and French revolutionaries who were active at the end of the 18th century. \n"}, {"text": "Another key U.S. 'R' president was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the man who occupied the White House during both the Great Depression and World War II.  What position did he hold directly before becoming president in 1932?  ", "correct": "Governor of New York", "options": ["Senator", "Ambassador to Germany", "Secretary of the Navy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGovernor of New York.\n\n\tFDR is another important and somewhat controversial figure that has resided in the White House.  Many give him credit for having moved the United States from a position of economic desperation during the early 1930s to an economic boom through his New Deal policies, while others believe that the war was responsible for the economic revival.  Few doubt Roosevelt's prowess as a 'war president', but some have questioned whether or not he knew about the Pearl Harbor attack beforehand.  Like Reagan, whether one agrees with his politics or not, one must admit that Roosevelt played a key role in shaping world politics in the 20th century.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz and I invite you to try the others in this people A-Z series. \n"}]}
