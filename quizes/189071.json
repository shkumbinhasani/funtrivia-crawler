In fact, as of 2004 his movie was the only non-documentary film to have been allowed the privilege of filming within the confines of that holy Islamic city. \n"}, {"text": "Let's stay in the Middle East for a bit.  Which of these popular movies was partially filmed at the ancient stone site of Petra in Jordan?", "correct": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", "options": ["Twelve Monkeys", "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold", "The Fifth Element"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\n\tSteven Spielberg is well-known for having enjoyed using many unusual locales for the filming of the Indiana Jones films.  In 'The Last Crusade', the third of the series, we are treated to scenes filmed in Spain, Italy, Germany, England, Australia, the U.S. and, of course, Jordan.  \r In this installment, Indiana Jones searches for the Holy Grail along with his father, played by Sean Connery.  Their pursuit of the grail takes them to Petra, Jordan's city of stone, which, incidentally, is nearly 3,000 years old. \n"}, {"text": "In the various James Bond films you will occasionally see scenes of famous international monuments and other world sites.

This is one of only a few films to have ever featured the interior of the Colosseum.  The Italian government is unlikely to allow more filming within the confines of the ancient monument, they no longer even allow concerts to be performed there for fear that the noise will crack the stone. \n"}, {"text": "I simply can't resist another question about Rome.
