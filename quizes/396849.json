What they discover is that the plane has a bit of a history.\rThat history tracks back to the city of T\u00f8nsberg, Norway in 1942 during the Second World War.  There, as the Germans invaded, a contingent of higher-ranking Nazi officials arrived to desecrate a tomb.  Their leader, Johann Schmidt, is excited to find the contents-- the Tesseract, the jewel of Odin's treasure room.  What's in the coffin that's opened is not the Tesseract, but they find it anyways; it's hidden within a wall-sized wood carving of the tree of Yggdrasil.  He leaves with the item, killing its protector, before departing. \n"}, {"text": "Steve tries for a fifth time to enlist and, finally, succeeds at which of these events?", "correct": "World's Fair", "options": ["Stark Expo", "The Olympic Games", "Independence Day Parade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld's Fair.\n\n\tIn New York City, Steve Rogers enlists...again...to serve his country.  He's rejected...again...due to a multitude of health issues that he's had over the years.  Every time he enlists, it's the same deal.  His close friend, 'Bucky' Barnes, is expected to go overseas the next day, so the two of them head to the 1943 World Expo in Queens and watch a flying car demonstration performed by none other than Howard Stark.  While at the expo, Steve tries one more time, heading to a temporary enlistment center to try to enlist, and it's there that a scientist, Dr. Abraham Erskine, overhears him and earmarks him for the Strategic Scientific Reserve, offering him a chance, as a little guy, to do something.\rIn a secret mountain lab, Schmidt works with Dr. Arnim Zola to unlock the secrets of the Tesseract, and what they find could change the world.  Their next step is to stop the Allies but taking the serum that they've developed. \n"}, {"text": "During basic training, Col. Phillips tosses a grenade at his troops.  What does Rogers do?", "correct": "Jumps onto it", "options": ["Throws it back", "Runs away", "Stands, paralyzed with fear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJumps onto it.\n\n\tSteve is sent along with the men of the Strategic Scientific Reserve almost immediately, falling into the training regime under Col. Chester Phillips and Peggy Carter and finding that he's not really cut out for the expected physical requirements.  The regime's goal, at the end of it all, is to single out one candidate to become the inaugural member of a super-soldier initiative set up to end the war. Surprisingly, while Steve is horribly inadequate for basic training, Dr. Erskine believes him to be the only choice because of his problem solving and unbreakable spirit.  Col. Phillips, believing that another soldier, Hodges, is a better choice, tests his men by throwing a dummy grenade into their group to test their reactions. Everyone flees except Steve, who throws himself onto it to protect his fellow soldiers.  That night, when Rogers has a chance to talk to Erskine, he asks why he was chosen, and Erskine brings up their plan to overthrow Hydra and Johann Schmidt, who leads the division and searches for an immense power within the planet.  He, personally, tried to change himself using a super-soldier serum and while it worked to an extent, it had its obvious side effects.  Erskine chose Steve because he was weak to start and wouldn't squander the gift he would give him.  He needs to stay who he is: an imperfect soldier but a good man. \n"}, {"text": "The lab where Steve is experimented on is found in which of these locations?", "correct": "An antiques store", "options": ["A library", "A public school", "A deli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn antiques store.\n\n\tPeggy Carter escorts Steve to a Brooklyn Antiques shop, bringing him in to reveal a hidden tunnel in the back room leading to an expansive laboratory.  Time isn't wasted, especially since the lab needs to use the city's power grid to perform the experiment.  Steve is placed onto a contraption and Howard Stark is asked to confirm that they are ready to begin the procedure.  The procedure requires that serum be injected into all of Steve's muscle groups to spark immediate changes and stimulate growth, and that's done with a flick of a switch.  Steve is sealed away in a chamber and blasted with gamma rays (well, 'vita-rays') to the maximum capabilities of the machine before it shuts down, and when the chamber opens, he appears to be a different man.  The procedure is a success.\rThere's no time to celebrate, however, when Dr. Erskine is shot twice and killed by an assassin.  Peggy pursues the shooter while Steve mourns the loss and follows close behind.  Peggy manages to slow down the assassin's escape, but Steve is able to pursue on foot through the Brooklyn streets, keeping up with a stolen taxi and gaining enough ground to intercept it and crash it.  The assassin flees with a hostage in tow and makes haste to a hidden submarine, but Rogers wins that chase too, and the assassin kills himself with a cyanide capsule. \n"}, {"text": "The Strategic Scientific Reserve is sent to Europe to search specifically for Hydra.  Does Steve go with them?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tHydra is proud to have stopped the United States from continuing to develop their serum with the death of Erskine, but the loss of the last remaining vial causes problems for both sides since no one can reproduce the miracle super-soldier formula.  In Europe, Schmidt speaks with Hitler's men and shows off the recent advances, specifically acquiring the power of the Gods to operate without Hitler.  He demonstrates this by killing them with it and planning to destroy the world's greatest cities with his weapon.\rIn America, meanwhile, Rogers undergoes further tests as his blood is the only thing that they can use to reverse engineer the serum.  Howard Stark, at this time, investigates the German submarine from the Brooklyn piers to find that the technology is too far advanced and could only be from Hydra, the German deep science division, indicating that Schmidt was the orchestrator of the assassination.  The Strategic Scientific Reserve heads to London, but Steve is left behind and expected to go on tour to promote Patriotism and acquire bonds for the troops.  It's not what Steve wanted, but he supports the troops and becomes famous as Captain America for doing so. \n"}, {"text": "Peggy recruits who of the following to help Steve get to Austria?", "correct": "Howard Stark", "options": ["Col. Phillips", "Dr. Erskine", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoward Stark.\n\n\tIt all changes when he heads to Europe to perform for the troops.  Reaching the Front in Italy in 1943, Steve tries his schtick with actual soldiers and gets heckled.  It's lousy, but he gets the chance to run into Peggy Carter again.  It's not the greatest reunion though; it's from her that he learns he was performing to the remainder of Bucky Barnes' battalion-- the 107th-- and that most of them died or were captured not long before his arrival.  Col. Phillips confirms Barnes' death, and with the soldiers thirty miles behind enemy lines, there's nothing they can do.  Steve decides to head over there on his own, and while Col. Phillips doesn't know, Peggy lets him go, recruiting Howard Stark to fly him where he needs to be.  She gives Stark a transponder and then leaps out of the plane, braving artillery fire.\rHydra, meanwhile, continues to expand by using their prisoners to build their labs.  Some of the captured men of the 107th end up in cells on the night Steve flies in and infiltrates. \n"}, {"text": "Schmidt reveals that beneath his face, his skull is which colour?", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Gold", "Black", "Yellow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tReaching the Hydra base, Rogers manages to force his way inside and sneak through the structure to find the cells.  When he does, he introduces himself as Captain America and frees everyone sends them out to perform a prison break.  He goes deeper though, letting the chaos unfold while he persists.  Schmidt, seeing this from his surveillance room, starts the timers and grabs the Tesseract while Zola grabs his blueprints. Steve manages to find Bucky strapped to a table in one of the lab rooms and the two escape as the main chamber is detonated, destroying all of Schmidt's work.  They catch up to Schmidt as he's about to depart and it leads to a small interaction, but the two can't come to blows for long. Schmidt does, however, reveal himself as one of Erskine's greatest successes and pulls off his mask to reveal a red skull underneath his face, citing it as a side effect of the serum in its early days and indicating that it made him more than human.  He and Zola flee while Steve and Bucky scramble, narrowly escaping as the facility crumbles. \n"}, {"text": "From what material is Captain America's shield made?", "correct": "Vibranium", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVibranium.\n\n\tSteve is considered killed in action after his trip across enemy lines but, to the shock of many, he returns a hero having freed all the men from the Hydra compound.  Col. Phillips doesn't allow Steve to give himself over for disciplinary action.  Instead, the troops celebrate Captain America.  He's subsequently awarded a medal for valour and given a promotion-- actually to Captain.  He builds a team of his own, bringing Bucky and others along with him as an exclusive squad.\rHoward Stark investigates a sample of Tesseract energy that Rogers snagged from the facility and comes to discover the stakes that are at play.  He ends up taking Steve aside to work on some items for him, demonstrating shields and creating an outfit designed to protect him from German bayonets.  The shield Steve ends up choosing is a sleek prototype made from vibranium, the rarest metal in the world, designed to be completely vibration absorbent.\rAnd so Steve's work begins.  He and his team spend months successfully thwarting Hydra and the Nazis. \n"}, {"text": "Steve is unable to save Bucky during their mission on the train.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOne of the missions Captain America sends his men on a trip to the Alps where he and Bucky leap aboard a moving train to capture Dr. Zola.  Steve and Bucky are split up-- Zola quickly discovers that they're present-- and when they finally reunite, a battle against a strongly-armoured foe ends with Bucky being blasted out the side of the train and down the snowy mountainside to his presumed death.  They capture Zola and bring him to London for questioning, but the loss weighs heavily.  They do, of course, get the whereabouts of Schmidt's final Hydra facility from him after Col. Phillips interrogates Zola, and they discover the magnitude of Schmidt's plan: he wishes to wipe out all of the world's cities.\rPeggy finds Steve drinking in a bombed-out London bar and she reminds him that it wasn't his fault that Bucky was lost.  There's little time to grieve though; they only have twenty-four hours, and probably less, before Schmidt enacts his plan. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Howard Stark locate the tesseract after it falls out of Schmidt's plane?", "correct": "In the ocean", "options": ["In Switzerland", "In Captain America's pocket", "In New York City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the ocean.\n\n\tCap rides his motorcycle in through the front door of Schmidt's base and fights his way in solo.  It does get him captured-- he's very obviously outnumbered-- but that was the plan.  He's brought to Schmidt immediately and the battle commences, sending Cap through the tunnels of the compound and, eventually, splitting him from his troops when he boards Schmidt's enormous private plane (at the last moment) as it starts to make its way to New York City.  Seeing that the plane is loaded with world-ending missiles, Cap strives to get rid of them all before Schmidt can drop them, even managing to pilot one to prevent leaving the ship behind.  It all leads to a fight in the control room which ends abruptly when Cap throws his shield, hitting the device containing the Tesseract and allowing it to fall out.  When Schmidt picks it up with his bare hands, it seems to open a portal to the universe which, in an instant, sucks Schmidt through.  As the Tesseract falls to the ground, it instantly eats through the metal floor and falls out into the Arctic sky.\rIt doesn't solve all of the issues though.  Cap still has to deal with the plane full of missiles, and to do that he radios back home and tells Peggy he has no choice-- he has to bring down the plane to save everyone.  He crashes it into the Arctic while he's still on the radio.\rHoward Stark goes looking, but can't find the plane.  He does, however, find the Tesseract on the ocean floor.  The Strategic Scientific Reserve ends its operations and Captain America is lauded as a hero.\r And then one day, Steve wakes up in bed.  He's told he's in a New York City recovery room.  There's something weird though.  Sensing something wrong, he breaks his way out of his room and out of a facility full of people, emerging in modern day New York City, specifically Times Square.  He's only stopped when he's surrounded and approached by Nick Fury.  It turns out he's been asleep for nearly seventy years. \n"}]}
