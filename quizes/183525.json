{"id": "183525", "name": "Did John Wilkes Booth Escape? Quiz | U.S. Presidents | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "     U.S. Presidents", " Abraham Lincoln"], "questions": [{"text": "The generally accepted view is that Booth was finally cornered at which of these locations?", "correct": "Garrett's Farm", "options": ["Dr. Mudd's Residence", "Ford's Theatre", "The Surratt Home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarrett's Farm.\n\n\tBooth was said to be cornered in a tobacco barn on Richard Garrett's farm. The barn was set on fire, but Booth refused to surrender. (See question 3.) After the shooting at Ford's Theatre, Booth made his way\rto Dr. Mudd for treatment of his broken leg. The Surratt home was apparently the site for many conversations among the conspirators. \n"}, {"text": "Speculation as to the involvement of prominent people in Lincoln's assassination usually focuses on which of the following individuals?", "correct": "Secretary Stanton", "options": ["Stephen Douglas", "Mary Todd", "Hannibal Hamlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecretary Stanton.\n\n\tSome books have suggested that Stanton was involved in the plot; that view is rejected by most historians. Be that as it may, Stanton was a decidedly \"curious\" fellow who had many \"peculiarities\". The idea of Stanton's involvement was undoubtedly assisted by the extreme  secrecy that surrounded the aftermath of the shooting and by the treatment of the conspirators. \n"}, {"text": "According to the traditional view, what happened to Booth?", "correct": "Shot by Union troops who had been pursuing him", "options": ["Died in prison", "Executed along with the other conspirators", "Killed in a brawl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShot by Union troops who had been pursuing him.\n\n\tThe conventional view is that Booth emerged from the fiery barn on Garrett's farm and died there as a result of a gunshot to the neck.\r(See qestion 4.) \n"}, {"text": "Who claimed \"credit\" for shooting Booth?", "correct": "Boston Corbett", "options": ["John Parker", "Alexander Stephens", "Henry Rathbone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston Corbett.\n\n\tCorbett was an apparently unbalanced fellow. He took credit for shooting Booth - despite orders not to do so - and collected a reward as a result. It has been suggested, however, that the angle of the bullet that killed Booth is more consistent with suicide: a shot by Booth from the pistol that he was carrying.  (Parker was a guard who was assigned to protect Lincoln at the theatre; Major Rathbone was present with Lincoln when Booth struck). \n"}, {"text": "Who was said to be with Booth when he was captured?", "correct": "David Herold", "options": ["Lewis Payne", "George Atzerodt", "John Surratt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Herold.\n\n\tHerold, believed to be somewhat simple-minded, was said to be with Booth at Garrett's farm. Herold surrendered; Booth did not. (The other three choices were arrested as conspirators.) \n"}, {"text": "Which of the conspirators escaped execution?", "correct": "John Surratt", "options": ["George Atzerodt", "David Herold", "Lewis Payne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Surratt.\n\n\tSurratt found safety out of the country. His mother (and the three other choices given here) were not so lucky. They were executed. \n"}, {"text": "What tattoo did Booth have (which later served as an identifying mark)?", "correct": "His initials", "options": ["The Confederate flag", "A derringer", "\"Sic Semper Tyrannis\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis initials.\n\n\tBooth had impressed \"JWB\" on his hand. \"Sic Semper Tyrannis\" is said to be what Booth yelled as he leapt to the stage after shooting Lincoln. (\"Thus always to tyrants\".) \n"}, {"text": "What was Booth's motive for killing Lincoln?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["White supremacist views", "Dislike of Lincoln", "Sympathy for the Confederate cause"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tBooth certainly hated Lincoln and seems to have been substantially involved with confederate intelligence operations while the war was ongoing. Kidnapping thoughts, however, ultimately changed into  murder plans. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the individuals targeted by the conspirators suffered significant injury at the hands of the conspirators?", "correct": "William Seward", "options": ["Ulysses Grant", "Salmon Chase", "Andrew Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Seward.\n\n\tJohnson was apparently a target, but an attack never occurred. Seward was attacked by a knife-wielding Lewis Payne. Seward was badly injured by the powerful Payne, but survived. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following asserts that Booth escaped and lived for many years following the assassination of Lincoln?", "correct": "Finis Bates", "options": ["D.I. Mead", "Seth Kantor", "Barr McClellan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinis Bates.\n\n\tThere were apparently many claims in the last part of the nineteenth century that Booth had been spotted or that someone had \"admitted\" to being Booth. Many of these claims were made by obvious cranks, but Bates tells an interesting tale about a man that he encountered in Oklahoma long after the assassination had occurred. (The identification of Booth was somewhat uncertain; there was also a desire by the government to claim that the guilty party had been captured. In that regard, there are striking similarities to the aftermath of the JFK assassination.) \n"}]}
