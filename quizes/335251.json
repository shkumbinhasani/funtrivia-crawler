When you don't shift, the symbol is different.  The symbol on the same key as the question mark on most QWERTY keyboards is the ___.", "correct": "Forward slash (/)", "options": ["Period (.)", "Comma (,)", "Equal sign (=)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForward slash (/).\n\n\tOn most QWERTY keyboards, the question mark is on the same key as the forward slash.  When you hold down the shift key, and press this button, you get a question mark.  However, it doesn't work when you use the caps lock function; the caps lock only works for letters, not symbols.  The comma is on the same key as the less than sign, the period is on the same as the greater than sign, and the equal sign is on the same as the plus sign (+).\r NOTE: I cannot show the less than and greater than symbols as they are used in html code. \n"}, {"text": "When you finish a sentence with a question mark, it is no longer a regular sentence.  Identify another term for a sentence asking a question.  ", "correct": "Interrogative Sentence", "options": ["Exclamatory Sentence", "Interjection", "Asking Sentence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterrogative Sentence.\n\n\tA question mark at the end of a sentence makes the sentence an interrogative sentence.  An interrogative sentence usually is a sentence that may or may not have a question mark at the end of it, but it usually requires an answer.  For instance, an interrogative sentence that does not involve the question mark (since I resolve not to use a question mark in this quiz), is \"tell me what two plus two is.\"  The sentence requires a response, and can be asked as a question as well.\r An exclamatory sentence, or interjection, is a sentence that ends in an exclamation point! \n"}, {"text": "A question mark has many other names besides \"question mark\".  Tell me another name for the question point.", "correct": "Eroteme", "options": ["Bang", "Guillemets", "Pilcrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEroteme.\n\n\tThe question mark has many different names: question mark, interrogation point, interrogation mark, question point, query, and eroteme.\r A bang is another name for an exclamation point (!).  Guillemets are also called angle quotes, and I cannot type them here, because they look like two greater than signs and two lesser than signs, and that is html code.  The pilcrow is another name for the paragraph mark (\u00b6). \n"}, {"text": "It is sometimes believed that the question mark began as a two letter abbreviation for the word quaestio.  The two letters would eventually evolve into the question mark we know today.  Name the two letters that were used in the abbreviation.", "correct": "Qo", "options": ["Qu", "Qe", "Qa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQo.\n\n\tThe Latin word \"quaestio\", which means \"question\", was abbreviated using a capital Q and a lowercse O.  Of course, in medieval times, the capital Q looked more like a lowercase q.  The abbreviation \"qo\" was not written as \"qo\", but instead, the q was written on top of the o.  Watch the question mark history below to see the evolution from the original \"qo\" symbol to what we know today.\r q 9 7\ro o .\r Of course, I omitted the last step, which shows the mark becoming the question mark we know today.  You can see how the question mark began as the abbreviation \"qo\", became a little more rounded, resembling a 9 instead of a q, then it opened up and resembled more of a 7, and the o now became a period. \n"}, {"text": "Question marks are often used in algebraic chess notation.  If there is a single question mark, it means that you have made a ___.", "correct": "Bad move", "options": ["Interesting move", "Blunder", "Dubious move"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBad move.\n\n\tAccording to Wikipedia, if you have made a bad move in chess, it is symbolized by a single question mark.  If you made a mistake/blunder, it is symbolized by two question marks.  An interesting move is symbolized by an exclamation point followed by a question mark, and a dubious move is symbolized by a question mark followed by an exclamation point. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes a question mark can replace data that is not known.  For instance, for my family's family reunions, we used to make t-shirts listing everybody.  If anyone is pregnant, the unborn baby would be replaced with a question mark, since they do not yet have a name.  All of these are other ways to replace data that is not known, but your job is to find the one that is NOT a way to replace this data.", "correct": "A tilde", "options": ["Unknown", "N/A", "Leave a blank space"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tilde.\n\n\tYou can signify unknown data in many different ways.  You may use a question mark, or use \"N/A\", which means \"not applicable\".  You could also write the word \"unknown\", like if you do not know where a quote comes from, or just leave a blank space sometimes.\r A tilde is the mark above an \"n\" or other letters, and looks like \"~\".  For instance, in the Spanish language, a tilde is used above an \"n\" when the sound makes a \"nya\" sound, like in pi\u00f1ata. \n"}, {"text": "It is tough to make ten questions about the history of a question mark, so I'll go on to a music question.

The Question Mark set a record for the longest flight because it was refueled during its flight.  This also allowed it to set the record for the farthest distance traveled by a plane.  So you know the plane was called the Question Mark, but I want you tell me which plane refueled the Question Mark.", "correct": "Douglas C-1", "options": ["Atlantic-Fokker C-2A", "Boeing 747", "The Exclamation Point"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouglas C-1.\n\n\tThe Question Mark was an Atlantic-Fokker C-2A, and it was refueled by the Douglas C-1.  In January of 1929, the Question Mark set many records for flight of an aircraft.  It set records for sustained flight in both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air, for a refueled flight, and for distance.  It was able to achieve the distance record for an aircraft because it did not need to land for fuel; it was fueled in midair.  This test flight of the Question Mark proved a success, and many military aircrafts today are fueled in the same way. \n"}, {"text": "I was a bit shocked to learn that there is a kind of insect called a question mark.

It is most often used in the Spanish language, at the beginning of a question.  A mirrored question mark looks like a backwards question mark, with the opening of the question mark facing away from the end of the question, and not towards it.  A full-width question mark is simply a giant-like question mark used in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. \n"}]}
