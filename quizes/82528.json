{"id": "82528", "name": "Outstanding Plot Twists Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"Vertigo\", Jimmy Stewart is led to believe that a particular woman is crazy. She isn't. Instead, she is?", "correct": "An impostor", "options": ["Drinking to excess", "Cheating on her husband", "Planning a crime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn impostor.\n\n\tKim Novak isn't really the wife: she's pretending to be her, however, so that the real wife can be murdered. That card isn't shown until well into the movie. Nicely done by Hitch. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Witness for the Prosecution\", the defendant cheats justice (briefly), but then receives punishment. How?", "correct": "His wife kills him", "options": ["His girl friend dumps him", "He is killed in an accident", "He is found guilty of a different crime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wife kills him.\n\n\tThe wife engages in complicated machinations only to have the ingrate husband shun her for another woman. So ... bang. Clever idea to have the wife frame the husband (intentionallly badly) instead of trying to exonerate him. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Charade\", Audrey Hepburn is deceived by Walter Matthau into believing that he is?", "correct": "A government official", "options": ["Working for her husband", "Working for an insurance company", "A bounty hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA government official.\n\n\tHe isn't, of course, he's just a villain in disguise. That's not revealed, however, until the very end of the movie. Entertaining. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Bullitt\", there's a problem with the man that Steve McQueen and his fellow officers are asked to guard. What is it?", "correct": "He's not who they think he is", "options": ["He's not where they think he is", "He's a member of the police", "He's already dead when the find him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe's not who they think he is.\n\n\t\"You had us guarding the wrong man, Mr. Chalmers\". Good action movie. \n"}, {"text": "At the start of \"Laura\", the title character is mistakenly believed to be a?", "correct": "Victim", "options": ["Police detective", "Witness", "Killer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictim.\n\n\tShe's dead, isn't she? Apparently not, but we don't learn that for a while. Classic mystery. \n"}, {"text": "In  \"Stalag 17\", key information is communicated between the prisoner-spy and the Germans by what?", "correct": "Chess Piece", "options": ["Pack of Cards", "Pair of Dice", "Coin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChess Piece.\n\n\tWith a loop in the overhead light wire indicating that the message was there. Good movie. Nice work by Holden. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Sting\", Newman helps Redford by having someone pose as a cop in order to try to handle a real cop. Who plays the \"real cop\"?", "correct": "Charles Durning", "options": ["Robert Shaw", "Harold Gould", "Dana Elcar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Durning.\n\n\tShaw is the victim of the \"Sting\". Gould is \"Kid Twist\", a part of the con team. Elcar is the fake cop. Great fun. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Malice\", Nicole Kidman schemes to get money via a bogus medical malpractice case. Who is her co-conspirator?", "correct": "Alec Baldwin", "options": ["George C. Scott", "Bill Pullman", "Peter Gallagher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlec Baldwin.\n\n\tScott is a doctor. Gallagher is a lawyer. Pullman is the wronged husband. \"I am God\". Clever plot turns. \n"}, {"text": "Turning to the theatre, \"Sleuth\" is a wonderfully entertaining piece of work with a variety of twists. Anthony Shaffer wrote the play; what else did he write?", "correct": "Whodunit", "options": ["Black Comedy", "Amadeus", "Equus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhodunit.\n\n\tThe other three were by the very talented Peter Shaffer. \"Sleuth\" was Anthony Shaffer's masterpiece; his other works (including \"Murderer\" and \"Whodunit\") never quite reached that high a level. (Yes, there is a movie version: don't bother with it.) \n"}, {"text": "Turning to novels, \"The Magus\" by John Fowles is as wild a ride as you'll ever take in the pages of a book. Which of the following is NOT by Fowles?", "correct": "Mila 18", "options": ["A Maggot", "The French Lieutenant's Woman", "The Collector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMila 18.\n\n\tIt's an amazing novel. \"Collector\" is also a fine read; the other two are less compelling. (Yes, there is a movie version: don't bother with it.) \"Mila\" is by Leon Uris. \n"}]}
