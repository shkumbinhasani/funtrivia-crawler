{"id": "61620", "name": "Break On Through With 'The Doors' Quiz | Movies | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", " The Doors"], "questions": [{"text": "The first voice we hear in the movie is not Val Kilmer's, but Jim Morrison's -- it's a recording of one of his poems from the collection 'An American Prayer.' Which one is it?", "correct": "'The Movie'", "options": ["'Awake Ghost Song'", "'Newborn Awakening'", "'Stoned Immaculate'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'The Movie'.\n\n\t'The movie will begin in five moments, the mindless voice announced...' Val Kilmer, as Morrison, reads off the opening lines of 'Awake Ghost Song' a few minutes later, but the first words spoken in the film are by Morrison himself. \n"}, {"text": "Which real-life member of The Doors has a cameo in the movie?", "correct": "John Densmore, the drummer", "options": ["None of them", "Ray Manzarek, the keyboardist", "They all do"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Densmore, the drummer.\n\n\tDensmore plays the studio engineer in the booth urging Morrison to call it a night in the opening sequence. \n"}, {"text": "As the title of the film floats across the screen, we hear the first actual Doors song in the movie. Which song is it?", "correct": "'Riders On the Storm'", "options": ["'The End'", "'Break On Through'", "'Light My Fire'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Riders On the Storm'.\n\n\tFitting, since the script took a good deal of 'inspiration' from John Densmore's memoir of the same name. In fact, the working title for the movie was 'Riders On the Storm.' \n"}, {"text": "Early in the film, we see a flashback in which young Jim Morrison witnesses a group of Navajos who have been mortally wounded after a car accident. True or false: the child playing Morrison in this scene is actually a relative of Jim Morrison.", "correct": "false & f & no & n", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nfalse & f & no & n.\n\n\tSean Stone, son of director Oliver Stone, plays young Jim Morrison. Sean has small roles in virtually every film his father has ever directed. \n"}, {"text": "Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan) first meets Jim when he climbs a tree and crawls through her second-story window. She asks him, 'You have a problem with doors?' What is Jim's oddly appropriate reply?", "correct": "'Waste of time.'", "options": ["'I don't understand them.'", "'Doors aren't everything.'", "'Who needs doors?'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Waste of time.'\n\n\tWhether or not this exchange actually took place, we'll never know...but I found it interesting, all the same, given Morrison's eventual attitude toward fame in general and 'rock god' status in particular. \n"}, {"text": "Which eventual member of The Doors does Morrison meet first?", "correct": "Ray Manzarek", "options": ["He meets them all at the same time", "John Densmore", "Robby Krieger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRay Manzarek.\n\n\tJim and Ray (Kyle MacLachlan) met as students at UCLA film school well before forming The Doors. Oliver Stone, by the way, plays their film professor. \n"}, {"text": "When Jim first mentions that he has been writing songs, he is urged to sing a few verses, but is too shy. It's quickly pointed out that having a great singing voice is not necessary to succeed in the music scene. Who is put forth as an example of this theory?", "correct": "Bob Dylan", "options": ["Peter Noone", "Ringo Starr", "Mick Jagger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob Dylan.\n\n\tRay says: 'Come on, man, you gotta sing better than Dylan'...and then lapses into a rather amusing parody of Dylan's 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' to prove his point. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this line of poetry, written by Jim for Pam: 'She dances in a ring of fire...and throws off the challenge with a ______.'", "correct": "shrug", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nshrug.\n\n\tBoth Jim and Pam recite this line several times throughout the movie. \n"}, {"text": "As the idea of forming a band is initally being discussed, 'The Doors' is not the first name suggested. What is?", "correct": "Dionysus", "options": ["Fire", "The Blue Bus", "Dementia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDionysus.\n\n\tAs Ray and Jim are discussing a number of literary, mythological, and psychological inspirations, Jim makes a reference to Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and song. Ray immediately latches onto that idea, and says, 'We should call ourselves Dionysus!' Jim immediately one-ups him, however: 'I was thinking 'The Doors'.' \n"}, {"text": "The first time we see The Doors actually rehearsing, what song are they working on?", "correct": "'Break On Through'", "options": ["'Back Door Man'", "'Light My Fire'", "'The Crystal Ship'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Break On Through'.\n\n\tRobby Krieger (Frank Whaley) introduces the group to his composition 'Light My Fire' pretty quickly, but when Jim, Ray, Robby, and John are shown together for the very first time, they're feeling their way around 'Break On Through.' \n"}, {"text": "Drummer John Densmore (Kevin Dillon) has minor reservations about 'Light My Fire' because he thinks it sounds too much like the style of another band. Which band is it?", "correct": "The Byrds", "options": ["The Beatles", "The Rolling Stones", "Herman's Hermits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Byrds.\n\n\tOf course, this scene takes place in 1961, and The Byrds didn't hit it big until their cover of Bob Dylan's 'Mr. Tambourine Man' hit the charts in 1965...but hey, it's an Oliver Stone movie. =) \n"}, {"text": "Jim leads the band into the desert to experiment with peyote. While under the influence, which of The Doors admits to being afraid of his father?", "correct": "Robby Krieger", "options": ["John Densmore", "Jim Morrison", "Ray Manzarek"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobby Krieger.\n\n\tJim certainly has 'father issues' as well, but it's Robby who breaks down in tears and makes this particular admission. \n"}, {"text": "Jim is displeased, to say the least, that The Doors have been asked to change the the line 'girl, we couldn't get much higher' if they want to perform 'Light My Fire' live on television. Ray points out that another notable band made a similar change, so maybe they should, too. What band was he referring to?", "correct": "The Rolling Stones", "options": ["Herman's Hermits", "The Beatles", "The Byrds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones.\n\n\tFor the record, the Stones changed not just a minor lyric, but the *title* of a song in order to play on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' Their hit 'Let's Spend the Night Together' became 'Let's Spend Some Time Together' so as not to suggest a frivolous sexual encounter. Perish the thought! \n"}, {"text": "Fill in the missing word from Pam's line to Jim that more or less serves as the theme of the movie: 'You're a ________, not a rock star.'", "correct": "poet", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\npoet.\n\n\tMost biographies of Morrison make this very assertion, and name it as the root cause of his depression and self-destructive behavior. \n"}, {"text": "Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan) uncovers the fact that Jim has lied to the press about his parents being long dead. According to her research, with which branch of the United States armed services is Jim's father affiliated?", "correct": "the Navy", "options": ["the Army", "the Marines", "the Air Force"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe Navy.\n\n\t'Affiliated' is putting it mildly: Admiral Morrison was the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations in Viet Nam! \n"}, {"text": "When Jim is arrested for onstage 'vulgarity' for the first time, what state is he in?", "correct": "Connecticut", "options": ["South Carolina", "Alabama", "Florida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nConnecticut.\n\n\tJim was arrested -- on stage, no less -- in New Haven, Connecticut in 1968. Less than a year later, he was arrested a second time in Miami, Florida on similar 'public obscenity' charges. \n"}, {"text": "On Thanksgiving, Jim ruins an elaborate dinner prepared by Pam. What was the main course?", "correct": "duck", "options": ["squab", "goose", "turkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nduck.\n\n\tPam, repeatedly: 'You killed my duck!' \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the movie, it's clear that Jim sees 'visions' of American Indians (mostly the dying Navajos he first saw as a young boy) here and there. Later in the movie, other characters are inexplicably able to see these 'phantoms' as well. Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Patricia Kennealy", "options": ["Ray Manzarek", "Pamela Courson", "They all see these 'phantoms'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPatricia Kennealy.\n\n\tAs Jim is dancing about the stage during a performance of 'Not To Touch the Earth,' Ray sees ethereal Indians dancing right along with Jim. And just before Pam discovers Jim's dead body, she sees the tall, bald Indian whom Jim has been seeing on and off throughout the movie. There's never any evidence that Patricia sees these figures at all. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: The Wicca Priestess who marries Jim and Patricia is played by the real Patricia Kennealy.", "correct": "true & t & yes & y", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue & t & yes & y.\n\n\tThat must have been weird for her, huh? \n"}, {"text": "Producer Paul Rothchild (Michael Wincott) finally runs out of patience with Jim's irresponsible behavior when Jim is so drunk that he is unable to sing a certain song properly during a studio session. What song is it?", "correct": "'Touch Me'", "options": ["'Shaman's Blues'", "'The Soft Parade'", "'Wild Child'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Touch Me'.\n\n\tAll of these songs appear on the album 'The Soft Parade,' but it's 'Touch Me' that Jim botches repeatedly. Shortly thereafter, he's able to get in a good recording of 'The Soft Parade' with a little help from Pam...the exact nature of which we will not discuss in this venue. =) \n"}, {"text": "Who is the unfortunate opening act that gets booed off the stage at The Doors' famous 1969 Miami concert?", "correct": "Barry McGuire", "options": ["The McCoys", "Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs", "The Zombies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarry McGuire.\n\n\tThe manic crowd barely lets McGuire and his band finish 'Eve of Destruction' -- they want Morrison! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following real-life figures is NOT portrayed by an actor at some point in 'The Doors'?", "correct": "musician Lou Reed", "options": ["artist Andy Warhol", "TV host Ed Sullivan", "vocalist Nico"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmusician Lou Reed.\n\n\tNico (Kristina Fulton) attends the party thrown by Andy Warhol (Crispin Glover), but she is the only member of Velvet Underground to make an appearance...although we do hear Lou Reed's vocals on the soundtrack during that very scene. And we do get to see Ed Sullivan (Will Jordan) backstage as The Doors are preparing to appear on his show. \n"}, {"text": "A real-life musician best known for his 80's work had a small role in 'The Doors' that was supposed to be bigger. Who is this musician?", "correct": "Billy Idol & Idol", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Idol & Idol.\n\n\tIdol, who played Cat, was severely injured in a motorcycle accident shortly before filming began. His role was appropriately scaled back -- and every time we see Cat, he's on crutches! \n"}, {"text": "Oliver Stone was so concerned about having Val Kilmer capture Jim Morrison's presence that he hired a choreographer to help Kilmer dance, walk, and just generally *move* like the real Morrison. Whom did he hire for this duty?", "correct": "Paula Abdul", "options": ["Jennifer Lopez", "Debbie Allen", "Patricia Kennealy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaula Abdul.\n\n\tWorth every penny, I would say -- Kilmer's transformation is nothing short of uncanny. \n"}, {"text": "And finally, to settle an occasional debate about 'The Doors': almost every time we see Val Kilmer singing, that *is* his actual voice, and not Morrison's, that we're hearing. One notable exception to this rule occurs during the performance of which of the following songs?", "correct": "'L.A. Woman'", "options": ["'The End'", "'Five To One'", "'Not To Touch the Earth'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'L.A. Woman'\n\n\tMy including 'The End' as an option here was a little tricky: when we first hear that song, it is the original Doors track playing in the background as Jim (who is not singing at this point) follows his 'spirit guide' into a cave in the desert. But then, halfway through the song, the scene changes, and we are now seeing a live performance of 'The End'...and from this point forward, it's Kilmer's vocals. We don't hear 'L.A. Woman' until one of the last shots of the movie, and even though Kilmer's lips are moving, it's clearly Morrison's voice. \n"}]}
