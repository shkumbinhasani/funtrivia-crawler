The aurora does come but this time it's stronger than normal, and when they approach it in their vehicle, it seems that something crashes down beneath it.  They drive through the dust to investigate, but sideswipe a figure they don't really see.\r More than a thousand years ago in Tonsberg, Norway, under a more common aurora, the people there believed in their Gods.  While the Frost Giants threatened their way of life, they were aided and protected by these Gods in ferocious battles led by Odin, the Asgardian King, in Jotunheim.  When the Gods won, they took a dangerous relic back to Asgard with them, leaving the Frost Giants in ruin. \n"}, {"text": "Odin claimed that both of his children, Thor and Loki, would be fit for the throne.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAs children, both Thor and Loki heard the tales about the Frost Giants and the great wars from their father, Odin, who assured them that only one of them would be able to ascend the throne in the future and become the King of Asgard, in turn enforcing peace throughout all the realms.  It was Thor who was deemed mighty enough to wield Mjolnir, the enchanted hammer, and on the day of his planned ascension, an ambush occurred. While Thor made his pledges for the throne, only Odin sensed that the Frost Giants had returned to attempt to reclaim the Casket of Ancient Winters.  They managed not to steal the relic, but Thor was angered by the attempt and suggested that they retaliate. Odin, outright, suggested that war would be a horrible answer, and as he is stated, Thor was not yet King.  Loki backed up his brother, in private, sharing his fear that the Frost Giants could strike again in the future, and it was enough to convince Thor that he and his most fearsome warriors that they should head to Jotunheim and fight the threat head-on. \n"}, {"text": "Thor provoked war during his trip to Jotunheim.  What was his punishment from Odin?", "correct": "Banishment", "options": ["Imprisonment", "Servitude", "Reparations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBanishment.\n\n\tOn horseback, Thor brought Loki, Sif, and the Warriors Three to Heimdall, the gatekeeper of the Bifr\u00f6st, able to teleport them through the realms, and there they were allowed to pass through quietly, partly because of Heimdall's curiosity in knowing how enemies passed his watch.  And it was there that they were teleported to Jotunheim in a single blast that propelled them across the universe.  They arrived to find a quiet, chilly, and dark world where Laufey, the King of the Frost Giants, met them and warned them off, insinuating that he would only give them one chance.  He also warned them that there could be a traitor in Asgard who let his people in to steal their relic.  Thor, stubborn and proud, did not heed his warning, instead taking the first swing with Mjolnir when provoked and sparking the battle.  Despite being obviously outnumbered and at a strategic disadvantage, Thor and the others fought until it became obvious that their chances were too slim to continue.  They were only saved when Odin arrived via the Bifr\u00f6st and interfered, accepting that his son had provoked war with his actions.  When they returned to Asgard, he noted his regret in believing that Thor was ready for the throne and, to curb the boy's vanity and arrogance, he stripped him of his title and powers, casting him out of the realm and enchanting Mjolnir to only be wielded if the suitable candidate was worthy enough to do so.\rThor subsequently landed on Earth and was prominently sideswiped by a vehicle in the New Mexican desert. \n"}, {"text": "The arrival of Mjolnir on Earth pulls the attention of who of these?", "correct": "Phil Coulson", "options": ["Tony Stark", "Natasha Romaoff", "Dr. Bruce Banner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil Coulson.\n\n\tJane worries about the scientific breakthrough in New Mexico as it happens, but her colleagues, Dr. Selvig and Darcy, worry more about the man they just hit as his ranting seems to be unnerving.  Darcy tazes him when she's frightened enough to do so and Dr. Selvig piles him into their van so that they can rush him off to a hospital.  Jane eventually comes to agree with their call - he should go to a hospital.\rThe hospital trip turns out to be a rough idea.  When Thor regains consciousness he lashes out at the doctors while they try to get a blood sample.  As it turns out, Odin did take away all of his powers.  Jane, Darcy, and Selvig later return to the hospital to find that Thor has disappeared.  They go to leave, but accidentally back their car into him again.\rThe next day, out in the New Mexico desert, someone drives out to find Mjolnir in a crater.  But no one can lift it from its spot.  It does create a bit of an event though, and that attracts Phil Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D.\rIn Asgard, Thor's companions discover that Loki gave away the group's position in Jotunheim, leading Odin to interfere.  Though it saved their lives, his mischief got Thor banished.  The others begin to theorize that Loki could have had something to do with the attack on the vaults. \n"}, {"text": "Loki discovers which of the following about himself?", "correct": "He is not Odin's biological son.", "options": ["He is from Earth.", "He has a finite amount of life left in him.", "He is the rightful owner of Mjolnir."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is not Odin's biological son.\n\n\tOdin finds Loki in the vault lifting the Casket of Ancient Winters and though he asks him to stop, it's too late.  Odin has no choice but to reveal that the magic of the Casket will have a different effect on him because he's actually a descendant of the Frost Giants, specifically Laufey, and Odin took him from the battlefield and raised him as his son with the hope that his effort would unite the two realms.  Loki, furious, retaliates at Odin and leads his father to fall into a deep sleep.\rBack on Earth, Thor is forced to acclimatize to his new surroundings, but he and the others discover that a 'satellite' has landed out in the desert.  Although the feds have taken control of the situation, Thor believes he can reclaim Mjolnir himself and asks Jane to take him.  Selvig suggests she not get involved since Thor seems to be talking about people, places, and things from Norse mythology, and Jane agrees it's gone a bit too far... so Thor goes it alone.\rBut things change very soon after.  As soon as everyone parts ways, Jane finds that her research is being claimed by S.H.I.E.L.D. because of their investigations.  Everything is taken.  She has no choice in the matter. \n"}, {"text": "Thor fights his way to Mjolnir through S.H.I.E.L.D.'s men.  Who of these is amongst them?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Iron Man", "Black Widow", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tIn Asgard, Sif and Thor's warriors head to the throne room but find Loki sitting in Odin's seat.  Because Odin is deep in a sleep from which he may never awaken and his mother, Frigga, waits by his side, Loki is the only one for the throne.  They ask for Thor's banishment to be reversed, but Loki refuses to undo his father's wishes with his first action and the group is forced to leave.\rWith nothing left to lose, Jane gives Thor the ride he needs out into the desert.  They arrive at their destination in the night to find that S.H.I.E.L.D. has set up an entire base around Mjolnir.  Thor infiltrates alone, donning a poncho after breaching the perimeter and using the chaos to get all the way into the center of the compound.  Coulson sends Clint Barton out to snipe the intruder with a bow and arrow from overhead, but it doesn't much matter.  Thor fights his way in, steps up to the hammer... and can't move it.  He lets S.H.I.E.L.D. apprehend him shortly after. \n"}, {"text": "Who is able to claim Thor from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody?", "correct": "Dr. Selvig", "options": ["Jane", "Darcy", "Loki"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Selvig\n\n\tCoulson speaks to Thor directly in an interrogation room and when Coulson leaves the room, Loki appears before Thor, informing him that Odin has died - his banishment and the threat of a new war was too much to bear - and that a truce with Jotunheim is contingent upon Thor's continued exile.  All of this is a lie, but Thor believes it and he apologizes to his brother.  Loki later tries to move Mjolnir himself, but is unable.\rJane returns to Selvig and Darcy and the three of them think about the Norse mythology they've read in books, ultimately stumbling across Mjolnir, Thor, Loki, and others from the old stories.  Selvig is skeptical of everything, but Jane feels it's best to pursue every lead, no matter how strange, because it could get them closer to understanding their astrophysics research.\rDr. Selvig puts himself forward and pretends that Thor is his colleague to try and break him out for Jane.  Coulson lets this happen knowing full well that Thor is not the man they say he is, but he has them tailed.  And then Selvig and Thor drink way too much.  Back at Jane's office, Thor tries to make sense of her research with her, explaining the Nine Realms, and it's clear that they both seem to have an attraction to one another. \n"}, {"text": "Who is amongst those who heads to Earth to collect Thor?", "correct": "Sif", "options": ["Heimdall", "Frigga", "Odin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSif.\n\n\tLoki, now with the power a circumstances he needs, returns to Jotunheim alone to seek an audience with his true father.  Loki suggests that he can cloak Laufey and his men, bring them into Asgard, and have them kill Odin themselves before reclaiming the Casket of Ancient Winters.  Loki returns to Asgard after this encounter and warns Heimdall not to let anyone use the Bifr\u00f6st.\rBut that instruction is not listened to.  Heimdall calls upon Sif and the Three Warriors while they talk in private about defying Loki and he insists that they commit treason, though he won't defy Loki himself.  Instead, he leaves the Bifr\u00f6st behind and they are allowed to use it themselves, landing in New Mexico near Puente Antiguo.\rLoki sees the Bifr\u00f6st being used from the palace and heads into the vault to summon the Destroyer.  His instructions: Ensure Thor does not return and destroy everything.  In retaliation, Loki freezes Heimdall in place with his Frost Giant powers. \n"}, {"text": "When Thor is finally deemed worthy, Mjolnir comes to him.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhile Coulson and his men investigate the Asgardians' landing site, another event occurs outside Puente Antiguo as the Destroyer drops from the sky and begins annihilating S.H.I.E.L.D.'s men.  Thor admits to his friends that he nothing but a mere man but he and the scientists work to try and save the people of the town.  Sif has the warriors distract the Destroyer while she attacks from behind.  Its magic is immensely strong though, and the four of them aren't a match for it.  Thor sends them back to stop Loki while he formulates a plan, stepping up to the Destroyer and speaking to Loki through it, offering himself as a sacrifice.  The creature turns to leave, but smacks Thor on the way out, casting him across the town while Jane rushes to his aid.\rAs Odin cries in his sleep in Asgard, Mjolnir shoots from the sky, flying straight to Thor, recognizing him as worthy of the power he once held.  As it returns to his hand, lightning strikes and he his revived, empowered more than enough to drum up a maelstrom and defeat the Destroyer once and for all.\rThere's little time to waste once this happens.  Coulson tries to talk to Thor, but there are clearly more important matters than debriefing.  Thor agrees to be Coulson's ally only if Jane's materials can be returned (they can; she'll need them for her research, after all) and he whisks her away into the sky so that she can see the reopening of the bridge of the Bifr\u00f6st.  Thor's cries allow Heimdall to break free of his ice prison and, weakly, activate the Bifr\u00f6st to send Thor and the Asgardians home, but not before a goodbye kiss to Jane.  He vows to return for her. \n"}, {"text": "In Asgard, Thor has no choice but to do which of the following?", "correct": "Destroy the connection to Earth", "options": ["Claim the throne", "Kill Loki", "Relinquish his weapons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDestroy the connection to Earth.\n\n\tThor and the others return to Asgard as Laufey enters Odin's chambers having been brought into Asgard by Loki.  As Laufey stands over Odin and prepares to put an end to his foe, he's shot aside and destroyed by none other than Loki, who orchestrated the whole thing.  Thor returns to the chamber in that moment and urges Loki to tell the truth, but Loki blasts Thor out of the kingdom and heads to the Bifr\u00f6st with the intent to destroy Jotunheim, blasting it apart. to impress Odin and take the throne himself.  The attempt has obvious ripples throughout the realms - even Jane and the others on Earth can see it.  The battle between the brothers escalates, pushing them out of the chamber and onto the bridge where Thor pins Loki down with Mjolnir and, realizing there's no other way to stop the Bifr\u00f6st, he smashes the bridge to sever the power but, also, isolate Asgard in its realm.  As the Bifr\u00f6st is destroyed, Odin arrives to save Thor and Loki from being scattered into the universe, but Loki, realizing that his plan never would have satisfied his father, lets himself fall into the blackness.\rOn Earth, the portal appears to close and give way to a clear, New Mexico sky.  Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head off and recommence their research to, perhaps, find a link back to the other realm.\rIn Asgard, the warriors tell their tales over great feasts.  Thor excuses himself from this to speak to Odin alone and admit that he does not wish to be the King as he is not wise enough yet.  Out on the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, later on, Heimdall says that not all hope is lost in reconnecting with Earth.  He can see Jane and she searches for him. \n"}]}
