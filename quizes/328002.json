{"id": "328002", "name": "Suddenly Snoozin' Quiz | Nervous System and the Senses | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Nervous System and the Senses", "Sleep and Dreams"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin, I have trouble falling asleep.  Once I'm asleep, I have trouble staying asleep.  What sleep disorder could this be?", "correct": "Insomnia", "options": ["Nocturia", "Narcolepsy", "Parasomnia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsomnia.\n\n\tInsomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep.  In addition, it is hard for one with insomnia to stay asleep.  Typically, it takes a month or more of trouble falling asleep and staying asleep before someone can be diagnosed with insomnia.\r Nocturia is a disorder that is characterized by a person needing to go to the bathroom a lot during the night.  Parasomnia is a disorder that involved odd behaviors and movements during sleep, such as sleep walking or night terrors.  Narcolepsy involves fatigue during the day, often making someone fall asleep at odd times, often unwillingly.  An example is someone falling asleep while driving home from work. \n"}, {"text": "Dreams that are remembered the next day usually occur during what sleep cycle?", "correct": "REM Sleep", "options": ["Both of these", "NREM Sleep", "Neither of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nREM Sleep.\n\n\tWhile dreams may occur during NREM (or Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, they are rarely, if ever, remembered upon awakening.  Dreams you remember occur during REM (or Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.  During REM sleep, the eyes move rapidly (hence the name) and the muscles become somewhat \"paralyzed\". \n"}, {"text": "Many people snore while they sleep.  Which of these is a surgery that removes tissue from the throat, in hopes to reduce (or even stop) snoring?  In this surgery, the uvula, adenoids, soft palate, tonsils, and the pharynx may all be removed.", "correct": "Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty", "options": ["Staphylotomy", "Uvulotomy", "Uvulopalatoplasty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUvulopalatopharyngoplasty.\n\n\tIn a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, many parts of the mouth and throat are removed, often times to reduce snoring.  Some or all of the list mentioned in the question are removed.  A uvulotomy, or a staphylotomy, is the removal of the uvula.  A uvulopalatoplasty is an out-patient surgery that removed part of the uvula, or sometimes all of the uvula, in several visits. \n"}, {"text": "There is a sleep disorder that involves a pause in breathing during sleep.  Sometimes a person will stop breathing for several minutes at a time, and sometimes hundreds of times an hour!  What potentially life-threatening disorder might this be?", "correct": "Sleep Apnea", "options": ["DSPS", "Bruxism", "Cataplexy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleep Apnea.\n\n\tSleep apnea can be very dangerous, because a patient will stop breathing for possibly several minutes at a time.  The disorder also causes fatigue and other side effects because the person does not get enough rest at night.\r Bruxism is the grinding or gnashing of the teeth.  DSPS, or Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome, is a disorder where the person cannot sleep at regular times during the \"night\", but falls asleep on a regular basis, usually early in the morning, and gets just as much sleep as a normal person.  Cataplexy, a rare disease, is when someone loses their muscle tone, and collapse to the floor. \n"}, {"text": "Although not considered a disorder, this condition can have serious side effects.  Which of these is when someone does not get enough sleep, also called sleep deficit?", "correct": "Sleep Debt", "options": ["Sleep Loss", "Sleep Starvation", "Sleep Lacking"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleep Debt.\n\n\tSleep debt is simply not getting enough sleep.  There are two kinds of sleep debt; partial and total.  Partial sleep debt is when someone does not get enough sleep for a few days or a few weeks.  However, total sleep debt is when the person is kept awake for days or weeks. \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes people cannot sleep because they have Wittmaack-Ekbom's Syndrome.  What is this condition more commonly known as?", "correct": "Restless Legs Syndrome", "options": ["Hypopnea Syndrome", "Periodic Limb Movement Disorder", "Shift Work Sleep Disorder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRestless Legs Syndrome.\n\n\tRestless Legs Syndrome is a sleep disorder that causes the person to feel a burning or itching sensation in their limbs, usually their legs.  The pain can be relieved by constantly moving the legs.  It can make it very hard to sleep through the night.\r Periodic Limb Movement Disorder is when someone moves their limbs involuntarily while sleeping (e.g. kicking the legs).  Shift Work Sleep Disorder is caused by someone who changes their work schedule, and thus their sleeping schedule, which can cause insufficient sleep, fatigue, or insomnia.  Hypopnea Syndrome is shallow breathing while sleeping. \n"}, {"text": "What is exactly is torpor?", "correct": "Temporary hibernation", "options": ["Long term sleep", "Eternal sleep (death)", "Sleeping with one eye open"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTemporary hibernation.\n\n\tTorpor is common in many animals, such as bats, hummingbirds, and mice.  This is when an animal has a normal body temperature during their active hours, but it drops while sleeping, which conserves energy.  Some animals that \"hibernate\" are in an extended state or torpor, such as groundhogs and squirrels. Lungfish switch to \"torpor mode\" when the pond dries out and they need to wait for water to swim in again.  Bears, though they are thought to hibernate, do not enter the state of torpor, because, though their body temperature decreases, they are still able to respond to their surroundings, while animals actually in torpor cannot. \n"}, {"text": "Many people who have trouble breathing at night may use a special machine to help them.  It is often called a CPAP machine, but what does CPAP stand for?", "correct": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "options": ["Consecutive Primes in Arithmetic Progression", "Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems", "Center for Public Administration and Policy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nContinuous Positive Airway Pressure.\n\n\tEven though all answers can be abbreviated as CPAP, only one has anything to do with sleep!  A CPAP machine forces air into the wearer's nose and mouth, allowing oxygen to get to their lungs.  It is especially helpful to those who have sleep apnea. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these sleeping positions will most likely cause snoring?", "correct": "On the back", "options": ["On the stomach", "On the side", "Sitting up"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the back.\n\n\tWhen sleeping on the back, oftentimes the tongue will fall to the back of the throat.  This will sometimes cause the person to snore.  Other things that exacerbate snoring include, but are not limited to: fat around the throat, obstructions in the nasal passage, fatty \"flaps\" in the throat vibrating together when breathing, drugs relaxing throat muscles, and sleeping on the back, as mentioned above. \n"}, {"text": "Now that I've had a good night's sleep, I need to get the gunk out of the corners of my eyes.  Do you know what that yellow crispy stuff is called?", "correct": "Both of these", "options": ["Rheum", "Gound", "Neither of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth of these.\n\n\tRheum is a thin mucus that comes out the eyes, nose and mouth during sleep.  It is a mixture of mucus and blood cells, skin cells, or dust.  It dries and forms a \"crust\" in the corners of the eyes or mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose.  The rheum \"crust\" in the corner of the eyes is called gound. \n"}]}
