A sharp curve makes it really difficult to hit a home run that way without hitting over 320 feet. In left, The Green Monster measures in at 37 ft 2 in. The wall is a popular target for right handed hitters as it is only 310-315 feet away from the batter. \n"}, {"text": "Alright, another stadium is done.
