While drinking more alcohol is the preferred solution of college-aged drinkers everywhere, it's not quite a true one.  Published studies have shown that while alcohol ingestion will likely dull the feelings of a painful hangover, it'll just put off the actual feelings.  It is not a form of coping with 'alcohol withdrawal' and it is not really a way of curing anything.  On the other hand, studies show that eating food and drink regularly will allow for the body to recover easier in times of a hangover.\rTo say the least, 'hair of the dog' never worked for rabies and it doesn't work here either. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the beer brand consistently seen on \"The Simpsons\"?", "correct": "Duff Beer", "options": ["Alamo Beer", "Pawtucket Ale", "Buzz Beer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuff Beer.\n\n\tWhile many different fictional drinks appear on the long-running TV show, \"The Simpsons\", Duff Beer has appeared in several episodes.

You usually won't find these in games for players below the age of 10.\rMMORPGs and large-scale role-playing games are usually slapped with one of these disclaimers due to their inclusion of said element.
