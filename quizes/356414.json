{"id": "356414", "name": "Point the Finger Quiz | Brain Teasers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Logic Puzzles"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin, you need to know the suspects.  There are three men (George, John, Robert) and three women (Barbara, Christine, Yolanda).  Each person was in a different room (Bathroom, Dining Room, Kitchen, Living Room, Pantry, Study).  A suspected weapon was found in each room (Bag, Firearm, Gas, Knife, Poison, Rope).\n\nWho was found in the kitchen?", "correct": "Robert", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert.\n\n\tWe learn early on that only a man is in the kitchen, leaving us with only three possibilities.  As the information at the end of question two points out, we know the poison was the kitchen.  Clue 8 tells us the firearm is with George, leaving us with only John and Robert.  After each clue is read, there are quite a few gaps, and after some clever deducing we find John in the living room.  This leaves only Robert as an option for the kitchen. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 1: The man in the kitchen was not found with the rope, knife, or bag.\n\nWhich weapon, then, which was not the firearm, was found in the kitchen?", "correct": "Poison", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoison.\n\n\tIn clue 1 from question 2, we learn the kitchen does not contain the rope, knife, or bag.  The second question asked which weapon was in the kitchen, and we learned here that the firearm was not one of them.  In question 10, we learned that the gas was found in the pantry.  That leaves only the poison to be left in the kitchen. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 2: Barbara was either in the study or the bathroom; Yolanda was in the other.\n\nWhich room was Barbara found in?", "correct": "Study", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStudy.\n\n\tWe learned early that Barbara was either in the study or the bathroom.  In clue 7, we read that Yolanda was not with the weapon in the study or the pantry, which meant she could not be in the study, either.  This leaves only Barbara. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 3: The person with the bag, who was not Barbara nor George, was not in the bathroom nor the dining room.\n\nWho had the bag in the room with them?", "correct": "John", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn.\n\n\tTo find who was in the room with the bag, we first had to determine where the bag was.  Near the very end of our deductions, we were left with only the option of the bag being in the living room (this was after all clues were read several times and a fair number of gaps were left, being able to be filled only be using the process of elimination).  Clue 5 told us that the weapon in the living room was with John or George, but the firearm we learned was with George.  It must be John, then, who was found with the bag. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 4: The woman with the rope was found in the study.\n\nWho had the rope?", "correct": "Barbara", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarbara.\n\n\tWe learned near the beginning that either Barbara or Yolanda was in the study (clue 2).  In this clue, we read the rope was in the study.  It stands to reason, then, that the rope was either with Barbara or Yolanda.  However, clue 7 told us Yolanda was not in the study or pantry, which leaves Barbara in the study.  Since we know the rope was in the study, it must be Barbara with the rope. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 5: The weapon in the living room was found with either John or George.\n\nWhat weapon was in the living room?", "correct": "Bag", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBag.\n\n\tIt was not discovered where the bag was until the very end.  By then, we had discovered the rope was in the study, the poison was in the kitchen, and the gas was in the pantry.  With what was left, the only place the firearm could be was in the dining room (with George) and the knife had to be in the bathroom, leaving the bag in the living room. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 6: The knife was not in the dining room.\n\nSo where was the knife?", "correct": "Bathroom", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathroom.\n\n\tThis was again something deduced near the end.  Once all clues were read a couple times and all information was filled in, the bathroom was the only place left for the knife to possibly be in, and as such, it can then be determined the knife was here. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 7: Yolanda was not with the weapon found in the study nor the pantry.\n\nWhat weapon was found with Yolanda?", "correct": "Knife", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnife.\n\n\tYolanda was known to be in the bathroom early, after the clue stating she was either there or in the study, and a later clue telling us she was not in the study.  Near the end, though (as discussed in question 7), we finally determined what room the knife was in.  Since the knife was in the bathroom, and that is where Yolanda was, the knife was therefore with Yolanda. \n"}, {"text": "Clue 8: The firearm was in the room with George.\n\nIn which room was the firearm found?", "correct": "Dining Room", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDining Room.\n\n\tWe knew George had the firearm after reading the clue from this question, but we did not know what room the firearm was in.  After reading all the clues, we eventually discover George to be in the dining room.  Of course, since George was with the firearm, it stands to reason the firearm was also in the dining room. \n"}, {"text": "It was discovered that Mr. Boddy was gassed in the pantry.  The suspect found in that room was the murderer.\n\nWho, then, do you point the finger towards?", "correct": "Christine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristine.\n\n\tAfter all the clues are read, it could eventually be discovered that Christine was with the gas (which also meant, of course, that she was in the pantry).  Since we know this is where Boddy was killed, she was most definitely the culprit.\r See below for a full list of suspects, where they were, and what weapon was in the same room as them.\r John was in the living room with the bag.\rChristine was in the pantry with the gas.\rBarbara was in the study with the rope.\rRobert was in the kitchen with the poison.\rYolanda was in the bathroom with the knife.\rGeorge was in the dining room with the firearm. \n"}]}
