Is it ironic or not that Johnny Depp's idiosyncratic film career began thanks to a quirky filmmaker like Wes Craven? \n"}, {"text": "Depp's career in film continued in 1986 with an appearance in the Vietnam war film 'Platoon'.  Who directed Depp in this modern war epic?", "correct": "Oliver Stone", "options": ["Michael Cimino", "Stanley Kubrick", "Martin Scorsese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliver Stone.\n\n\tDepp was just a part of a magnificent cast in this, the best of Stone's Vietnam War trilogy.  Alongside Depp, who played Private Lerner, appeared Willem Davoe, Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker and a number of other terrific character actors. \n"}, {"text": "One of my personal favorite Johnny Depp performances came as Wade Walker, a rock 'n' roll hoodlum with a heart, in which film directed by John Waters?", "correct": "Cry-Baby", "options": ["Pink Flamingoes", "Hairspray", "Pecker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCry-Baby.\n\n\tJohnny Depp really shines in this oddball 1990 John Waters film (Is that redundant?) that also features appearances by Ricki Lake, Iggy Pop, Willem Dafoe, Polly Bergen, Troy Donahue and Patty Hearst (yes, *the* Patty Hearst!)  Even if you aren't a John Waters fan, check it out just for fun. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Depp's reputation as a master of bizarre film roles continued in 1990 as he took the role of Edward Scissorhands in the film of the same name, his first collaboration with Tim Burton.  Who appeared as Depp's love interest in the film?", "correct": "Winona Ryder", "options": ["Ally Sheedy", "Demi Moore", "Holly Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinona Ryder.\n\n\tIn Depp's most outlandish performance yet (and perhaps ever), he played Mr. Scissorhands, a truly tragic figure.  Some interesting tidbits about this role...Depp only had to say 169 words for the role, a role that required him to lose 25 pounds so he could fit in Edward's tight leather costume. \n"}, {"text": "In 1994, Johnny Depp continued his collaboration with Tim Burton as the two of them brought back to life the career of which icon of Hollyweird?", "correct": "Ed Wood", "options": ["Divine", "Russ Meyer", "Andy Kaufman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEd Wood.\n\n\tJohnny Depp is marvelous in the title role of this film that also features an outstanding, Academy Award-winning portrayal of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau.  Depp claims that his inspiration for this role came from three sources: the 'blind optimism' of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of Jack Haley's Tin Man character in 'The Wizard of Oz' and famous music DJ Casey Kasem.  Personally, I think he sounds a lot like Jon Lovitz! \n"}, {"text": "In 1997, Johnny Depp turned to the crime genre with his role in the film Donnie Brasco.  Did Depp play the title role in this Mike Newell-directed thriller?  ", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAlongside film veteran Al Pacino and character actors Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and James Russo, Depp helped bring the real-life character Donnie Brasco (aka Joe Pistone) to life on the big screen.  This film showed that not only could Depp handle a role with more gravitas, but that he was one of the most versatile young performers of the day. \n"}, {"text": "In 1998, Depp once again was matched with one of the more unusual film directors of the day, this time in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'.  Who directed Depp in his off-the-wall performance as Raoul Duke in this film?", "correct": "Terry Gilliam", "options": ["Wes Anderson", "David Anspaugh", "Chris Eyre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTerry Gilliam.\n\n\tLike Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam is known for his selection of unusual themes and strange imagery...thus, Johnny Depp would fit right into one of his films.  'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is based on the book by Hunter S. Thompson, and Depp's character is essentially based on Thompson himself.  Depp headlines a magnificent cast in this film that also includes Benicio Del Toro, Ellen Barkin, Christina Ricci and several other notables. \n"}, {"text": "In 2000 Johnny Depp took a chance in a true romantic picture when he starred alongside which of these beauties in the lovely, culinary film 'Chocolat'?", "correct": "Juliette Binoche", "options": ["Kate Winslet", "Salma Hayek", "Naomi Watts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuliette Binoche.\n\n\tJohnny Depp plays Roux, the love interest for the Juliette Binoche character Vianne Rocher.  Depp further accentuated his versatility as an entertainer by playing guitar for the film's soundtrack.  Funny thing...Johnny Depp is not a big fan of fancy chocolates, at least according to the audio commentary for the film. \n"}, {"text": "Johnny Depp proved himself once again to be perhaps the least typecast actor in film when he performed the role of which real-life drug dealer in the 2001 film 'Blow'?", "correct": "George Jung", "options": ["Karl Weber", "Wilfredo Martin", "Max Rousseau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Jung.\n\n\tThe Ted Demme-directed film 'Blow', from 2001, featured Depp as George Jung, a sympathetic but yet rather unsavory individual who made and lost millions on the cocaine trade beginning in the 1970s.  Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) also appear and make their mark in this film. \n"}, {"text": "In 2003 Depp had his biggest career triumph yet with his performance in 'Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'.  Which rock 'n' roller did Depp claim as his inspiration for the character Jack Sparrow?", "correct": "Keith Richards", "options": ["Iggy Pop", "Little Richard", "David Bowie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKeith Richards.\n\n\tDepp's nomination for a Best Actor Oscar for 'Pirates' was, stunningly, his first.  Though he did not win, the critical acclaim he received for his performance as Captain Jack assured Depp of pretty much any movie role he might be interested in claiming, along with a huge paycheck for these future roles.  Fortunately, knowing Mr. Depp, we can look forward to more weird stuff from this actor sui generis.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try more of my quizzes in the future! \n"}]}
