{"id": "327059", "name": "The Events Leading to This Quiz...  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Quizmaker Tune-Ups"], "questions": [{"text": "This quiz happens to be an author's challenge, a title I found that was challenged by kyleisalive.  I liked the title, so I began to think.  I didn't want to just take the title without a solid idea.  Which of these would NOT be a reason I wanted a solid idea before accepting this quiz title?", "correct": "So I didn't need to edit my quiz after I wrote it", "options": ["So I didn't have to keep changing categories as I got new ideas", "So I didn't give up and delete the quiz", "So I knew how I'd work up the quiz, making it easier to write"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSo I didn't need to edit my quiz after I wrote it.\n\n\tEven if you have a solid idea and know exactly how your quiz is going to look, it's still a good idea to edit it after you write it.  It is wise to use a spellchecker for errors in that regard, but a checker will not always find all the spelling errors.  Even with a spellchecker, it is best to look over the quiz yourself to find any errors it might miss; a spellchecker might not notice all the errors.  For instance, a spellchecker will see \"there\" and mark it correct, but when reading it yourself, you might notice that you meant \"their\". \n"}, {"text": "Now that I've accepted the quiz title, I need to choose a category.  I originally chose thematic fun as my category.  But there are many subcategories in the thematic fun section.  What is the BEST subcategory to put my 10 question quiz into?", "correct": "Thematic 10 Questions", "options": ["Leave it in Thematic Fun; the editor will put it where it needs to go", "Thematic 10 Questions Easy", "Leave it in General; the editor will choose Thematic Fun for you"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThematic 10 Questions.\n\n\tWhen making a quiz and choosing a category, it is generally wise to be as specific as possible.  In this case, Thematic 10 Questions is as far as I can go.  Since it is a 10 question quiz, I do not want to put it in the 15, 20, or 25 Question Thematic Fun, and I don't want to simply leave it in Thematic Fun or General.  However, I also cannot go too far and put it in Thematic 10 Questions Easy, Hard, Tough, or Impossible.  Since it has never been played before, I have no idea how difficult it would be.  It would be best to leave that for the editors. \n"}, {"text": "Uh oh, now that I've written a few questions in the quiz, it's looking like this would work better in a different category.  Is it possible to change categories?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tYou can change categories at any time, up until the quiz is online (once the quiz is online, changing categories may result in the quiz being taken offline).  It is recommended to stay in your original category if you can, but quizzes change, and may need to be moved elsewhere.  If I wanted, I could even move the quiz to geography, and I could even rename the quiz.  Of course, the best idea is to stick with the title I've got.\r It looks like this quiz should go in the Quizmaker Tune-Up category.  I think I will go and do that now. \n"}, {"text": "Usually, I try to save my quiz after every question.  There is a very good reason for doing so.  Why do I save my quiz so often?", "correct": "So I don't lose any of my hard work", "options": ["Because if you don't, the editor won't accept the quiz", "So the editor can edit one question at a time", "Because if you don't, the question will disappear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSo I don't lose any of my hard work.\n\n\tIf you don't save often, you might lose some of your work.  Computers crash, screens freeze, and FunTrivia might have problems that will cause your work to disappear.  I've personally had this happen: you write the perfect question, even two or three, maybe more, and you go to save, and the site has problems and you lose all your hard work!  This can be prevented by saving and saving often.  Nobody likes losing their hard work.\r Of course, I didn't lose anything writing this quiz, but that's because I saved it often! \n"}, {"text": "It is always a very good idea to check your quiz for spelling before you submit it to the editors.  I, personally, like to edit my quiz after each question.  If I were to edit this quiz correctly, I would have realized there was a misspelled word in this vary question.  Normally, I would have changed this error before I submitted the quiz, to prevent getting a correction note, but for the purpose of this quiz, I have left it in there.  Can you find it, and type in the correct spelling of the word?", "correct": "Very", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVery.\n\n\tIn this question, I misspelled \"very\" and wrote \"vary\".  Normally, I would have realized my error and I would have fixed it, but for this question, I left it in there for you.  This is a perfect example of why you should edit your quiz with your own eyes.  A spellchecker would not have counted \"vary\" as misspelled, because it is indeed a word, but it certainly is not spelled correctly given the context.  Therefore, always edit your quiz yourself; don't rely solely on a spellchecker. \n"}, {"text": "While writing this quiz, I could not think of a good question for this very question.  I had no idea what to write, and it took me a while to actually come up with something to put in here.  What have I just experienced?", "correct": "Writer's Block", "options": ["Writer's Rash", "Writer's Cramp", "Writer's Anxiety"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWriter's Block.\n\n\tWhen you cannot think of anything to write, and you seem to be stuck, you are probably suffering from writer's block.  Writer's cramp is when your hands stiffen up and you cannot write (or type) anymore.  I certainly could type, I just didn't know what TO type.  Although I could have had writer's anxiety, I didn't feel like I couldn't write, and I didn't develop anxious feelings.  I simply couldn't write, so it was a block rather than anxiety.  Writer's rash is when you add an element to a story that really doesn't need to be there.\r Also note, if you have writer's block, instead of just putting \"a filler\" into your remaining questions, save your quiz and come back to it later when you are \"refreshed\".  It is better not to write anything at all than to write something meaningless in your quiz.  You don't want to forget and accidentally have some nonsense words in your quiz! \n"}, {"text": "This quiz writing is hard work.  Now that I've finished my quiz, I'm ready to submit it.  Since my quiz is a Quizmaker Tuneup in the General category, and since I am not an editor, who will eventually put my quiz online to be played once it is ready?", "correct": "An editor from the General category", "options": ["I can put the quiz online directly", "Terry himself", "No one; it's been online and being played this whole time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn editor from the General category.\n\n\tThough Terry may sometimes place a quiz online, this job is generally left to the editors.  These editors edit certain categories.  The editor who will look at my quiz and put it online is one who edits in the General category.  It won't be looked at by the World editors, or the Animals editors, but the General editors.  I cannot place the quiz online myself; an editor will have to look at it. \n"}, {"text": "After I submitted my quiz, I had to wait for it to go online.  Though it didn't take very long, it felt like an eternity.  When you're waiting for a quiz to go online, even 3 days seems like forever.  As I waited for the quiz to be checked by an editor, I went in to the quiz and clicked save.  What happens when you do that?", "correct": "The quiz goes further down the queue, making your wait longer", "options": ["The quiz goes to the front of the queue, so it goes online faster", "It is automatically put online", "It is taken out of submission and you will have to resubmit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe quiz goes further down the queue, making your wait longer.\n\n\tIt is best not to mess with your quiz once it has been submitted.  You can look at it all you want, but an editor will see that you are in the quiz and may not edit it because you're in it, and this may cause the wait to be longer.  Also, if you click save while in the quiz, it will be taken to the back of the queue, almost as if you resubmitted it completely.  Think of it as getting out of the line for a roller coaster to go to the bathroom; you can't go back to where you were when you're through.  You have to go to the back of the line and start the process all over.\r Only click save if absolutely necessary.  You can ask an editor to fix a minor spelling error as they edit the quiz later on, but if it's a major error, fix it yourself if you want to avoid a correction note. \n"}, {"text": "An editor finally checked my quiz, but instead of putting it online, they gave me a correction note.  They told me to carefully check my quiz for apostrophe and spelling errors scattered throughout.  In addition, question 7 needed a bit of reworking to make more sense.  I fixed question 4, and found all the apostrophe errors, but I could not find any misspelled words, and my spellchecker couldn't either!  What's the best thing for me to do now?", "correct": "Kindly ask the editor to point the errors out for you", "options": ["Rewrite each question to make sure there are no more errors", "Resubmit it; maybe the editor made a mistake", "Delete the quiz; obviously I can't write"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKindly ask the editor to point the errors out for you.\n\n\tThe editors will be more than happy to help you if you need it.  If you are ever confused for where the errors are, or how to fix them, etc, don't hesitate to ask.  It is better to ask the editor than to get a second correction note.\r NOTE: Obviously, I haven't submitted this quiz yet, so this question is hypothetical.  I have no idea if I will get a correction note or not.  This question is assuming that this quiz needs a correction note. \n"}, {"text": "After I finished fixing all the errors in my quiz, I resubmitted it to the editors.

I thanked him/her for helping me get the quiz online.  I also told them I enjoyed working with them, too.  A nice note like that deserved a nice response.
