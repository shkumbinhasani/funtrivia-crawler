In the film, 'Groundhog Day' the main character Phil Conners, played by Bill Murray, becomes aware after several repeated February 2nds that he has become trapped in the samsara.  While chatting with two new pals Gus and Ralph in a bowling alley in Punxsatawney, PA he laments his predicament.  He is most saddened by the fact that his reincarnations are occurring in cold Punxsatawney, and not which other location?", "correct": "Virgin Islands", "options": ["Aruba", "Hawaii", "Belize"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVirgin Islands.\n\n\tPhil hearkens back to a wonderful day he once had in the Virgin Islands...and something about sea otters.  His friend Gus, being the Zen master that he truly is, lends Phil a classic Buddhist line, suggesting that Phil should be a 'glass is half-full kind of guy'. \n"}, {"text": "Phil decides to 'throw caution to the wind', as the Rita character, played by Andie MacDowell, puts it, and lives a debauched lifestyle.  Womanizing and gluttony become Phil's raison d'\u00eatre, but he soon tires of this behavior as the karmic cycle continues to force him through the same mundane routine.  Phil lends to his bad karma by attempting to seduce Rita, through whatever underhanded means he can find.  This includes ascertaining which confections she enjoys.  Through experience he discovers that she *doesn't* like which of these two items?", "correct": "White chocolate and fudge", "options": ["Peanut brittle and almond roca", "Candy canes and gingerbread cookies", "Cotton candy and mint bars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite chocolate and fudge.\n\n\tPhil's continued womanizing ensures his days will repeat in the cold winter of Punxsatawney.  Day in and day out he attempts to 'woo' Rita by means of memorizing her favorite drinks, foods, poetry, etc.  He finds that she loves Baudelaire, sweet vermouth with a twist, rocky road and several other things...but she doesn't like going fast on the first date!  Phil causes his own suffering through his futile pursuit of something he cannot have.  This is all due to his bad karma, you know the phrase...what comes around, goes around? \n"}, {"text": "After pleasing his animal appetites, but failing to please his spirit, Phil eventually approaches the 4-Noble Truths of Buddhism.  The First Noble Truth states that 'All Life Knows Suffering'.  Phil's failed attempts to get what he wants forces him to this realization.  Phil mistakenly does not recognize the meaning of the Third Noble Truth however, that there is a way to end suffering.  He initially believes that this way is through suicide.  Which of these suicide methods do we not witness in the film?", "correct": "Freezing to death", "options": ["Electrocution", "Jumping from a building", "Being hit by a truck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreezing to death.\n\n\tPhil's suicide attempts do not lead him to the end of the path, but rather begin the karmic cycle anew.  This leads Phil to the discovery of the Eightfold Path, the true way to end suffering for a faithful Buddhist. \n"}, {"text": "Following his failed suicide attempts, Phil comes to the realization that there must be another way.  He consults Rita, who comes to believe his story via some major league convincing (Rita understands spirituality, and has faith!)  She plays the role of his Bodhisattva and suggests Phil try to improve himself with his gift of many reincarnations!  This means that he must cultivate himself, and learn to release the desires that have been causing his suffering.  Which of these activities is part of his self-improvement approach?", "correct": "Learning to play the piano", "options": ["Learning to sing", "Learning to play the guitar", "Learning to play the clarinet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLearning to play the piano.\n\n\tPhil becomes an expert piano player, among many other things, during the film.  He wisely takes his gift of many lives as a blessing and improves his standing upon the Earth.  He has discovered the first step along the Eightfold Path...Right Understanding!  Rita, as Bodhisattva (an enlightened being who remains on Earth to help others find enlightenment), accompanies Phil on his path, though her day is renewed just as Phil's is...at 6 AM every morning. \n"}, {"text": "Phil is now healthily embarked upon the Eightfold Path, the way to end suffering according to the Fourth Noble Truth.  His discovery of the second step on the Eightfold Path, Right Aspiration, further leads to his self-improvement.  Not only does he become an expert musician, but Phil also becomes adept at which of the following arts?", "correct": "Ice sculpting", "options": ["Driftwood carving", "Candy making", "Macram\u00e9"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce sculpting.\n\n\tAs Larry, played by Chris Elliott, states surprisingly , 'I didn't know he could ice sculpt!'  Phil's relentless self-improvement program includes the development of ice-sculpting talents, a handy ability to have in the freezing winter climes of western Pennsylvania!  His choice to become an ice-sculptor is not for ill reasons, he simply aspires to cultivate himself in ways that can only be described as...disinterested. \n"}, {"text": "Another step trod by Phil along the Eightfold Path is 'Right Effort'.  Rather than let failure deflect his self-improvement strategy, he allows it to become part of his nature.  Initially though, he struggles with this step along the path with his fruitless attempts to revive whom?", "correct": "An old, homeless man", "options": ["His friend Ralph who is hurt in an accident", "The mayor, who chokes on a piece of meat", "A child dying of leukemia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn old, homeless man.\n\n\tSadly, along the road of struggle Phil becomes aware that, though he is on the path of enlightenment, he must still witness the suffering and death of others.  He attempts a number of times to prevent the death of an old man, but in each case the man passes away.  As a nurse in the local hospital explains, 'sometimes people just die'.  This is a valuable lesson to learn for Phil... \n"}, {"text": "Another lesson Phil learns along the path is 'Right Speech'.  At the beginning of the film, Phil is sarcastic and cynical.  Later, he learns to quell these tendencies when he attempts to inveigle Rita into his womanizing trap.  Finally, he realizes that he should just be himself...jocular but without the mean edge.  This is exemplified by his greeting of the rotund gentleman, whom he meets each day outside his room in the bed and breakfast in which he stays.  'Bon giorno, senore!', he says, and proceeds to quote a line of poetry.  Finish this poetry quote that he delivers to this jolly fellow, 'Winter, slumbering in the open air, wears on his smiling face a dream of ______.'", "correct": "Spring", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpring.\n\n\tThis beautiful line is from the expert pen of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, here's a fuller excerpt: 'All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair - The bees are stirring - birds are on the wing, And Winter slumbering in the open air, Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!' \n"}, {"text": "Along with 'Right Speech', Phil learns 'Right Conduct'.  This means behaving in a clear and consistent manner, according to the values that we hold.  He begins to repeat his cycle of good behavior day in and day out, helping some ladies with a flat tire here, convincing a young couple to go through with their marriage there.  In addition to this, he also performs which of these regular acts?", "correct": "Saving a kid who falls from a tree", "options": ["Carrying an elderly woman's groceries to her home", "Delivering a woman's baby in a stuck car", "Returning some lost keys to a family trapped outside their house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaving a kid who falls from a tree.\n\n\tThough the kid never thanks him, Phil continues to save him from his fall...it's the right thing to do!  Among his other acts: he continues to help the old man he sees on the street (though Phil knows he's dying), fixes another man's back, saves another gent, Buster, from choking, and buys insurance from Ned Ryerson.  He is nearing enlightenment! \n"}, {"text": "Another step along the Eightfold Path is 'Right Livelihood'.  This means acquiring an occupation that benefits humankind.  By the end of the film, Phil has done this...becoming talented in a number of occupational areas.  In one scene, he is referred to as which of these?", "correct": "Doctor", "options": ["Professor", "Lawyer", "Mayor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDoctor.\n\n\tPhil is called 'Dr. Conners' by the wife of the man whose back he has fixed.  Apparently, Phil has become an expert health practitioner amongst his many other endeavors, and this includes some expertise with chiropractice (if only all chiropractors were that successful!) There is no indication that he will decide to leave his job as a weatherman, but it seems Phil is considering officially a change of scenery by the end of the film.  (I think that being a weatherman could be considered a 'Right Livelihood', surely?) \n"}, {"text": "The seventh step along the path is 'Right Mindfulness', a mindset wherein a person recognizes the moment within which s/he lives, rather than always hearkening back to the past or looking forward to the future.  True or false: Phil very clearly expresses the attitude, in words, described by 'Right Mindfulness' before the end of the film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter creating an ice sculpture for Rita, she responds, \"I don't know what to say.\"  Phil replies, \"I do.  No matter what happens tomorrow, or for the rest of my life, I'm happy NOW, because I love you.\"  He has virtually reached enlightenment, the only remaining step is 'Right Concentration', maintaining his new attitude going forward through meditation.  I'm guessing that, with Rita, he will achieve this ultimate goal.  I hope you will too...thank you for playing! \n"}]}
