{"id": "315758", "name": "\"Dancin' Homer\" Quiz | 'Simpsons' - Season 2 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 2"], "questions": [{"text": "Where does Homer tell the story that forms the basis of most of the episode?", "correct": "At Moe's", "options": ["At home", "At work", "On the phone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt Moe's.\n\n\tThe episode opens with Homer at Moe's and Moe asking Homer what happened to Capitol City.  Homer states that he simply doesn't want to talk about it because he doesn't want to be 'that guy who sits in a bar telling the story about how he became a loser'.  It doesn't take much longer before he gives in and tells the story anyways.\rIt begins with Homer and the family going to 'Nuclear Plant Employee, Spouse, and No More Than Three Children Day' at the Springfield Stadium.  The family is excited to go, but Homer is most excited of all because he feels that his ticket entitles him to drink as much as he possibly can. \n"}, {"text": "Who receives an autographed baseball from Flash Bailer, the washed-up major-leaguer?", "correct": "Marge", "options": ["Lisa", "Homer", "Bart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarge.\n\n\tAs the family goes to find their seat, Mr. Burns greets them at the entrance, mispronouncing the family name and referring to Maggie as 'expecting' (as his family card hasn't been updated).  Homer rushes through the process to avoid anymore humiliation.\rWhile waiting for the game to start, Bart tries to get an autograph from Flash, one of the players, who brushes him off almost instantly.  Marge, angry that the man would do such a thing, gets the ball signed with a small message hinting that he wants to see her after the game.  Bart is happy for the autograph and Homer is happy that Marge was hit on by a baseball star. \n"}, {"text": "Who sings the national anthem at the Nuclear Plant's baseball game?", "correct": "Bleeding Gums Murphy", "options": ["Nat King Cole", "Tony Bennett", "Cyndi Lauper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBleeding Gums Murphy.\n\n\tBefore the game begins, Mr. Burns heads to the field to make a feeble first pitch (for which he is laughed at) and Bleeding Gums Murphy takes to the mound to sing the national anthem (for twenty-six minutes).  After this, Lisa is the only one not tired of standing.\rThe crowd sits down and the commentator announces that the game will be played between the home team, the Springfield Isotopes (clearly sponsored by the Nuclear Plant) and the Shelbyville Shelbyvillians.  The commentator also states that the team is looking to beat its twenty-six game losing streak. \n"}, {"text": "Homer offers Mr. Burns a seat at the company game.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWithin the employee portion of the ballpark's stands, Homer is the only person to have an empty seat next to him, so Mr. Burns stops by and takes it in order to 'connect' with his employees.  Homer turns to Marge and says that his great night is now ruined, but she thinks it's great as it'll keep him out of trouble. Mr. Burns, however, offers Homer a beer which he graciously accepts.  By the sixth inning, both Burns and Homer are regular pals, drinking and chanting at the players.  On one occasion they do 'the wave'.  Finally, it comes down to crunch-time.  Homer shouts that all they need is a grand slam to win and he tries to get the crowd excited, which he is successful at by dancing in front of the sidelines. The team wins the game, and while Homer and the fans are ecstatic, Mr. Burns is shocked at Homer's behavior and he bans him from all company outings. \n"}, {"text": "Who gave Homer his mascot name?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["Bart", "Lisa", "Marge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tAfter the game, the family waits out for the bus home and many people congratulate Homer for helping the team win the game.  In the midst of this, the team's owner, Antoine, ends of coming outside to invite Homer to be the mascot for the team.  Looking back on this, Homer says that he should have thought it through a bit more, perhaps slept on it, but he agrees to join the organization as the team's mascot nonetheless.  None of the family gives him the name 'Dancin' Homer'- someone shouts the name at him to get him to board the bus home. \n"}, {"text": "Homer's act usually consists of himself dancing to which tune?", "correct": "Baby Elephant Walk", "options": ["Take Me Out to the Ballgame", "The Pink Pnather Theme", "The Safety Dance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaby Elephant Walk.\n\n\tHomer's fame gradually increases and before long, Homer's time with the team is headlined for audiences.  His appearances fill the stadium seats and before long, the team is winning more games than ever.  After a while though, Homer's antics aren't enough.  The Isotopes lose a game against Shelbyville and Homer is brought up to his new boss where he is told that he's been offered a position in Capitol City as their new mascot (as the old one has been 'getting up in years').  Homer tells the guys that he needed to make a decision with the family as they'd be coming along with him, and it was one of the hardest they'd need to make. The kids initially don't like the idea, but Marge tells him to follow his dream. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters does the Simpson family not say goodbye to?", "correct": "Moe", "options": ["Milhouse", "Ned Flanders", "Patty and Selma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoe.\n\n\tIn preparation for their big move to Capitol City, the family takes the time to have a moving sale (at which Homer reassures Flanders that he'll miss him too), Bart says goodbye to Milhouse in the treehouse, and Lisa notes that her goodbye would mean more if she had really gotten to know her friends.  The Simpsons leave Patty and Selma behind with the house and head out to the big city after Homer says goodbye to his fans in Springfield during a 'Dancin' Homer Appreciation Night'.  He gives one speech before the family departs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not one of the things that the family sees on their first drive through Capital City?", "correct": "Krustylu Studios", "options": ["Street crime", "Fancy clubs", "The cross-town bridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKrustylu Studios.\n\n\tAs the family nears their new destination, they look out the windows and marvel at the nightlife of their new home.  Taking the cross-town bridge, they pass a fancy night club, the Penny Loafer, as well as an old woman getting mugged outside.  At one intersection, the family sees Tony Bennett singing a song about Capital City (which plays in the background of the montage).  Homer is most impressed by their driving by the Duff Brewery shortly before the family goes through a Times Square-esque intersection.  The family stops off at their motel room for the night. \n"}, {"text": "The name of the Capital City mascot is the Capital City what?", "correct": "Goofball & Goof Ball", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoofball & Goof Ball.\n\n\tOn the first night, Homer is worried about performing in the big city for tons of new crowds.  Marge assures him that everything will turn out just fine.\rThe following day, Homer arrives at his new stadium and gets introduced to the Capital City Goofball himself on the diamond.  In the locker room, Homer goes over his fifth-inning routine which involves dancing to \"Baby Elephant Walk\" and spelling out the name of the city with his body.  Goofball assures him that everything will go just fine as long as he entertains the crowd. \n"}, {"text": "With whom do Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie sit in the Capitol City Stadium?", "correct": "The players' ex-wives", "options": ["The players' wives", "The commentator", "Homer's manager"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe players' ex-wives.\n\n\tAlthough Homer hears that his tickets place his family next to the players' wives, it turns out that they're actually for the upper, upper, upper mezzanine level with the players' ex-wives.  Homer is worried to no end, so much so that he ignores most of the game and orders tons of hot dogs.  When his time finally comes, he nearly misses it sitting on the sidelines and eating.  The spotlight shines to him and he goes onto the field to dance, but to no avail.  The crowd is far from pleased.\rThe family decides it's best to leave and they return to Springfield.  Regardless of Homer's failure, his family still manages to keep a smile on his face.  That brings the story to Moe's, where Homer has gone to seek beer.  Homer realizes that everyone is hanging onto his every word at the bar and he's asked to tell the story again. \n"}]}
