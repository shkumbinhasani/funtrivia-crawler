{"id": "170694", "name": "Innocent or Guilty? Quiz | Innocent or Guilty? | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "     Criminals", " Innocent or Guilty?"], "questions": [{"text": "Mary Surratt was hanged for her role in the conspiracy that killed Abraham Lincoln. What was the most damning evidence against her?", "correct": "Some of the conspirators, including Booth,  had meetings at her home", "options": ["She was often seen at Ford's Theatre in the company of Booth", "An incriminating letter written by her was found in Booth's posession", "She was a lifelong friend of Booth's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSome of the conspirators, including Booth,  had meetings at her home.\n\n\tThe conspirators met at Mrs. Surratt's home. Logic dictated that she must have been involved in the plot (or at least had knowledge of what was going on). Her son, John, was involved, but escaped retribution. Mary was hanged. \n"}, {"text": "The Rosenbergs were executed as spies. A principal witness against them was David Greenglass. Who was he? ", "correct": "Ethel's brother", "options": ["Julius' brother", "Julius' close friend", "Ethel's close friend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEthel's brother.\n\n\tEthel's younger brother was a key witness against the Rosenbergs. There is evidence to suggest that Julius may have been a spy, but the evidence against Ethel is far weaker. She may simply have had knowledge of what was going on. Be that as it may, she was executed with her husband when a presidential pardon was not forthcoming. \n"}, {"text": "Secretary Stanton was suspected by some of participating in the conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln. What was his relationship with Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson?", "correct": "Johnson wanted to delay Reconstruction; Stanton wanted to hasten it", "options": ["Stanton wanted to delay Reconstruction; Johnson wanted to hasten it", "Both shared identical philosophies that favored delaying Reconstruction", "Both shared identical philosophies that favored hastening Reconstruction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnson wanted to delay Reconstruction; Stanton wanted to hasten it.\n\n\tJohnson, a southerner (Tennessee)and Stanton did not see eye-to-eye. Johnson's dismissal of Stanton was a precipitating factor in the impeachment movement against Johnson. \n"}, {"text": "Bruno Hauptmann swore that he was innocent of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. Damaging evidence was provided at trial by Charles Lindbergh. What was it?", "correct": "Lindbergh claimed to recognize his voice", "options": ["Lindbergh claimed to recognize his gait", "Lindbergh claimed to recognize his handwriting", "Lindbergh claimed to have seen him near his home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLindbergh claimed to recognize his voice.\n\n\t\"Lucky Lindy\", the legend, testified that he recognized Hauptmann's voice. This identification was based on only a few words. Hauptmann always claimed innocence - but incriminating evidence was found in his possession. His attempts to explain it away were unavailing. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following factors is suggestive of some involvement by Lee Harvey Oswald in the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Seeming contact with people who had some links to the intelligence community", "Easier movements in and out of the Soviet Union than one might ordinarily expect", "A seeming paradox as to his position regarding Castro and Cuba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tOswald certainly was involved in some way, but it's hard to say precisely what he knew or what he did. He did move smoothly in and out of the Soviet Union at times, cutting through the usual red tape and delay. He handed out (pro-Castro) \"Fair Play for Cuba\" literature, but had an office at the same address as anti-Castro, anti-communist forces (and also associated with them). His contact with certain intelligence-connected individuals, such as George De Mohrenschildt, is also interesting. \n"}, {"text": "The role of Dr. Samuel Mudd in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is uncertain. What happened to him?", "correct": "He was imprisoned", "options": ["He was pardoned after confessing his involvement in the plot", "He was hanged", "He fled the country"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was imprisoned.\n\n\tDr. Mudd admitted only to attending to Booth's injured leg. It is unclear how well he knew Booth and whether it's feasible to believe that he wouldn't have recognized Booth on the night in question. \n"}, {"text": "Meriwether Lewis died under mysterious circumstances. Although many felt that it was murder, it was ruled a suicide. Why?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["The opinion of close acquaintances that he was capable of suicide", "Recurring problems with depression", "Financial problems"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tAfter the great pioneering expedition to the West, things went downhill for Lewis. \n"}, {"text": "There has always been some doubt as to whether Lizzie Borden killed her parents. What happened to Lizzie?", "correct": "Acquitted", "options": ["Imprisoned", "Executed", "Fled to avoid imprisonment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAcquitted.\n\n\tShe went to trial and was acquitted. \n"}, {"text": "Which person has NOT been suggested as \"Jack the Ripper\"?", "correct": "Isidore Fisch", "options": ["Montague Druitt", "Francis Tumblety", "Aaron Kosminski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsidore Fisch.\n\n\tFisch was the person named by Bruno Hauptmann as being involved in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Druitt was an unstable fellow who committed suicide at the time of the Whitechapel murders. Kosminski was a prime\rsuspect. Tumblety, an American, was also a prime suspect. \n"}, {"text": "A woman claiming to be \"Anastasia\" occupied headlines during parts of the twentieth century. What name did she go by?", "correct": "Anna Anderson", "options": ["Anna Sage", "Anne Morrow", "Anne Hathaway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnna Anderson.\n\n\tIf she wasn't Anastasia (and it seems that she was not), was she perpetrating a fraud or was she having profound mental problems? Morrow was Lindbergh's wife, Hathaway was Shakespeare's wife. Sage was \"the lady in red\" who helped nail Dillinger. \n"}]}
