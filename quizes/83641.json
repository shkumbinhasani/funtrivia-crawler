{"id": "83641", "name": "\"Real Genius\" For Diehards, Part 1 Trivia Quiz | Movies | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Real Genius"], "questions": [{"text": "The remarkable stylings of which vocalist can be heard under the opening credits of this film?", "correct": "Carmen McRae", "options": ["Billie Holliday", "Ella Fitzgerald", "Ethel Merman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarmen McRae.\n\n\tSpecifically, we hear McRae's mid-1960's rendition of \"You Took Advantage of Me,\" which is a fitting theme song for the film, given the treatment of the featured \"geniuses.\" \n"}, {"text": "The movie opens with a promotional film illustrating the benefits of a particularly creative military initiative.  Finish its name: \"Operation ____________.\"", "correct": "Crossbow", "options": ["Laser", "Disintegrate", "Phaser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrossbow.\n\n\tThe soldier depicted in the promo film even refers to himself as \"Crossbow One.\"  Operation Crossbow is based on the concept of utilizing a satellite and an advanced laser system to vaporize small (read: human) targets from space. \n"}, {"text": "Finish the name of the corporation slated to provide the U.S. military with the equipment required to make its secret weapon possible: _____________ Electronic Instruments.", "correct": "Darlington", "options": ["Devonshire", "Delevan", "Del La Plante"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarlington.\n\n\tDarlington is mentioned several times in the film.  An amusing inside joke: Cal Tech, the school on which \"Real Genius\"' fictional Pacific Tech is based, has encouraged its graduates to make the initials \"DEI\" as prominent as possible, for reasons unknown to this quizmaker.  Rumor has it that \"DEI\" can be found on the surface of the moon and at the peak of Mt. Everest.  \"Darlington Electronic Instruments\" therefore also seems to be a Cal Tech triumph of sorts. \n"}, {"text": "During the briefing at the opening of the film, Major Carnagle (Louis Giambalvo) requires clarification after the use of a specific word by David Decker (Ed Lauter).  What is the word?", "correct": "\"liberate\"", "options": ["\"nullify\"", "\"liquidate\"", "\"neutralize\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"liberate\".\n\n\tDecker says, in reference to George, the man who has left the room(and the Crossbow Project) on moral grounds: \"We may have to liberate him.\"  Carnagle immediately asks, \"'Liberate'?  As in 'liquidate'?\"  Decker is indeed using the term \"liberate\" as a euphemism for \"kill.\"  (Odd, though, that Carnagle uses ANOTHER euphemism as his point of translation.) \n"}, {"text": "At the local science fair where we first see Dr. Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton), he is asked by an autograph-seeking fan, \"What's Mr. Einstein really like?\"  What is Jerry's one-word response?", "correct": "Dead", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDead.\n\n\tNot exactly informative, but one can't argue with his accuracy. \n"}, {"text": "When we first see Mitch Taylor (Gabe Jarrett), he's trying to explain the particulars of his science project to his father (Paul Tulley).  What word does Mitch's dad clearly not understand?", "correct": "\"coherent\"", "options": ["\"covalent\"", "\"sentient\"", "\"sapient\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"coherent\".\n\n\tMitch: \"This is coherent light.\"  Mr. Taylor: \"Oh.  So, it talks?\"  Mitch, with a sigh: \"No.\"  \"Coherent\" is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as \"relating to or composed of waves having a constant difference in phase.\"  It follows that Mitch's expertise in this area has led him to being recognized by Hathaway as a potential genius in the field of lasers. \n"}, {"text": "At the science fair, Hathaway specifically mentions the name of the college that Mitch will soon be attending.  What is it?", "correct": "Pacific Tech", "options": ["UCLA -- San Diego", "Cal Tech", "Adams College"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPacific Tech.\n\n\tWe see the fictional college's name several times throughout the film.  Pacific Tech is clearly based on Cal Tech. (If you answered \"Adams College,\" you were thinking of \"Revenge of the Nerds\"!) \n"}, {"text": "True or False: At age fifteen, Mitch Taylor is the youngest student ever accepted into the college featured in this film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMitch's mother (Joanna Baron) wonders aloud if Mitch is breaking a record by being accepted to Pacific Tech so early, but Hathaway points out that they once accepted a twelve-year-old...but that unnamed lad \"cracked within the first semester.\"  Yikes. \n"}, {"text": "Mitch's mother (Joanne Baron) asks Hathaway a question that occurred to her while watching a particular episode of his science-related television show.  What was the topic of the episode? ", "correct": "radioactive isotopes", "options": ["pulsars", "nuclear reactor operations", "ozone layer decay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nradioactive isotopes.\n\n\tUnfortunately, Mrs. Taylor's question is: \"Is that your real hair?\" \n"}, {"text": "Finish Hathaway's quote: \"Mitch, compared to you, most people have the IQ of ___________________.\"", "correct": "a carrot", "options": ["a turnip", "cold oatmeal", "clam chowder"], "explanation": "\n\n\na carrot.\n\n\tA bit of an exaggeration, there. \n"}, {"text": "When we first see Chris Knight, he is wearing toy \"antennae\" on his head, and a t-shirt emblazoned with an amusing sentence.  What does the shirt say?", "correct": "\"I Love Toxic Waste\"", "options": ["\"Surf Nicaragua\"", "\"I'll Be Nicer If You'll Be Smarter\"", "\"Be Alert -- The World Needs More Lerts\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I Love Toxic Waste\".\n\n\tIt's actually a heart, and not the word \"love,\" but my ASCII skills aren't what they used to be.  Sue me.  =)  (Chris does wear the \"Surf Nicaragua\" shirt later in the film, but not in this scene.) \n"}, {"text": "Chris Knight is touted as being one of the top ten minds in America, and DEI employee Sherry Nugil (Patty D'Arbanville) claims to have been intimate with several people (presumably men) on that list.  Before she meets Chris Knight, how many of the \"top ten minds in America\" has Sherry been with?", "correct": "seven & 7", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nseven & 7.\n\n\t\"You'll be eight,\" she tells Chris.  Given that she later makes a (failed) pass at Mitch, and ends up with Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries) at the film's finale, it's possible that she made her way through all ten! \n"}, {"text": "Mitch meets Dr. Gene Meredith (Severn Darden) at a freshman mixer on his first day at school.  What advice does Meredith give Mitch?", "correct": "\"Never forget to check your references.\"", "options": ["\"Don't trust anyone.\"", "\"Don't eat yellow snow.\"", "\"Never look a gift horse in the mouth.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Never forget to check your references.\"\n\n\tMeredith starts off saying, \"Always...\" then trails off and says, \"No -- *Never* forget to check your references.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following people does Mitch encounter *first* upon his arrival at college?", "correct": "Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries)", "options": ["Kent Torokvei (Robert Prescott)", "Chris Knight (Val Kilmer)", "Jordan Cochran (Michelle Meyrink)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries).\n\n\tAs Mitch enters his assigned room, he sees Lazlo, who slinks into the closet without saying a word.

What's the corporation?", "correct": "Harley-Davidson", "options": ["Burger King", "IBM", "3M"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarley-Davidson.\n\n\tIt's a black t-shirt with the familiar Harley-Davidson logo.  Chris is actually seen wearing this shirt more than once throughout the film. \n"}, {"text": "Chris demonstrates his creative engineering skills by flying a remote-controlled gyroscope the size of a medicine ball around his and Mitch's room.  Chris explains that the chaotic appearance of their room actually has a system to it, and that the gyroscope would normally be \"filed\" under a certain letter, as it is a \"Toy.\"  The letter is not, however, \"T.\"  What is it?", "correct": "\"H\"", "options": ["\"J\"", "\"G\"", "\"Q\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"H\".\n\n\tChris: \"For example: this would be filed under 'H', for 'Toy'.\" \n"}, {"text": "Chris informs Mitch that he \"had a little trouble\" with one of Mitch's belongings, so he threw it out.  What was the item?", "correct": "a sportsjacket", "options": ["a pink shirt", "a \"Mister Rogers\" sweater-vest", "a pair of plaid pants"], "explanation": "\n\n\na sportsjacket.\n\n\tChris: \"I had a little trouble with the sportsjacket, so I threw it out.\"  It's entirely possible that Chris was kidding, but we never really find out one way or the other. \n"}, {"text": "Major Carnagle (Louis Giambalvo), Jerry Hathaway's primary government contact, presents Hathaway with a veiled threat during one of their characteristically unfriendly conversations.  Carnagle strongly suggests that, if the top secret project does not go off as planned, Hathaway will be charged with a felony.  Which one?", "correct": "fraud", "options": ["embezzlement", "tax evasion", "treason"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfraud.\n\n\tCarnagle, upon seeing Hathaway's new house, warns Jerry with, \"Fraud is a felony.\"  This strongly suggests that Hathaway bought the new house with \"secret\" payments from the U.S. government, and Carnagle will be happy to expose Hathaway's newfound source of (illegal) additional income if the project fails. \n"}, {"text": "As Hathaway approaches his new house, he is forced to chase a neighborhood dog off of his property, berating it verbally.  Of what breed is the dog?", "correct": "Great Dane", "options": ["Dalmatian", "St. Bernard", "German Shepard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Dane.\n\n\tWho lets a Great Dane run loose around the neighborhood, though? \n"}, {"text": "When Mitch enters the laser lab for the first time, his youthful appearance leads the students working there to mistake him for a delivery boy.

What animal's head decorates each of Chris' ears?", "correct": "panda", "options": ["penguin", "polar bear", "walrus"], "explanation": "\n\n\npanda.\n\n\tThe black-and-white face of the panda is easily discernible on the earmuffs. \n"}, {"text": "Chris makes a (possibly sarcastic) reference to the fact that the college -- or perhaps just Chris' dorm -- had recently held a look-alike contest.  Whom were contestants supposed to resemble?", "correct": "Marie Curie", "options": ["Albert Einstein", "Thomas Alva Edison", "J. Robert Oppenheimer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarie Curie.\n\n\tChris: \"We only had one entry in the Madame Curie Look-Alike Contest, and he had to be disqualified later.\"  Madame Marie Curie was the co-discoverer of radium. \n"}, {"text": "Again, during the \"ice rink\" scene, Ick offers an oversized piece of fruit to Mitch.
