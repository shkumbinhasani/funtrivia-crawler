{"id": "342235", "name": "10 BioShock Questions |   Video Games Trivia Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games A-C", "BioShock"], "questions": [{"text": "How does Jack arrive at the lighthouse leading to Rapture?", "correct": "Via a plane crash", "options": ["Via a water taxi", "Via a submarine", "He was already in Rapture to begin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVia a plane crash.\n\n\tThe game's protagonist, Jack, begins the game swimming in the ocean having miraculously survived a plane crash.  Luckily, he finds himself next to an island containing a lighthouse and he looks inside to find the entryway to the underwater city of Rapture.  By taking a bathysphere down into the depths of the sea, Jack will begin a journey through the city (already in chaos and ruin), and attempt to make his way back to his life on the surface.  Of course it's never that easy, is it? \n"}, {"text": "What is the first weapon obtained in the game?", "correct": "Wrench", "options": ["Rivet gun", "Crowbar", "Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWrench.\n\n\tEmerging from the first bathysphere of the game and wandering into the city of Rapture, Jack will locate this starting weapon, the only melee device found in the game.  While at first glance this simple tool is a weak substitute for bullets, clever players with a sense of stealth and proper upgrades will find it to be a great asset when battling the insane citizens of Rapture.  Certain tonics will allow Jack to hit harder, faster, and with special upgrades and you could find yourself quite comfortable with it in your hands. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following can not be hacked via the water pipe system?", "correct": "Computers", "options": ["Safes", "Turrets", "Cameras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComputers.\n\n\tThe hacking system rarely changes as you progress through Rapture (in terms of the requirements) but it will increase in difficulty a great deal.  To hack anything, you need to be next to the object and you need to connect a series of water pipes, replacing and swapping segments, to allow water to flow from one end to the other. If the water catches up to you and overflows it will hurt you.  Some of these pipes can set off alarms and others can simply short out.  Cameras and turrets will need to be disabled (with electricity) to be hacked though they may snap out of their disabling if you're not quick enough. \n"}, {"text": "When dealing with a Little Sister, one may rescue them or do which of these?", "correct": "Harvest", "options": ["Hug", "Harangue", "Harness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvest.\n\n\tIf you happen to defeat a Big Daddy escorting a Little Sister around Rapture, she'll be at your mercy and you can choose one of two options.  Rescuing a Little Sister will free her from the horrible experiments done to her and you'll receive a small amount of ADAM to spend at the Gatherer's Garden machines. Rescuing a Little Sister will also result in more benefits later on in the game (tonics, etc.).  If you Harvest a Little Sister you'll destroy her by removing the ADAM directly from her.  You'll get more ADAM, but you won't receive any later bonuses.  The end of the game will be determined by whether or not you harvest or rescue Little Sisters; harvesting at least one will result in a worse ending. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not regarded as a Plasmid?", "correct": "Hacking Expert", "options": ["Winter Blast", "Incinerate!", "Electro Bolt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHacking Expert.\n\n\tHacking Expert (and Hacking Expert 2) is a gene tonic found in Rapture which allows Jack to hack items with one less alarm tile and one less overload tile.  Likewise, the upgraded version removes two of each.  These effects can stack.  The former is found in Arcadia while the latter is in the Gatherer's Garden.\rThe rest are Plasmids, equippable serums which allow Jack to use powers normal humans never would be able to.  Winter Blast freezes enemies, Incinerate! sets them ablaze, and Electro Bolt zaps them (and disables security features temporarily).  Other Plasmids include Target Dummy, Insect Swarm, Telekinesis, and Enrage. \n"}, {"text": "In which location in the game must Jack defend the Rapture oxygen stores?", "correct": "Arcadia", "options": ["Hephaestus", "Apollo Square", "Rapture Central Control"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArcadia.\n\n\tArcadia is a lush, green sector of Rapture known for its abundant plantlife and its oxygen production which allows the city to keep breathing.  When Jack arrives here a compound will be unleashed into the air and he'll need to save the area from total destruction (thus saving all of Rapture from oxygen depletion).  This is also the area in which Jack will locate the Chemical Thrower and come face to face with disappearing Houdini Splicers.\rWhile traveling around Arcadia Jack will also need to visit the nearby Farmer's Market in order to locate necessary ingredients for a quest.\rHephaestus, Rapture Central Control, and Apollo Square are all visited later in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these weapons is the latest to be found in the game?", "correct": "Crossbow", "options": ["Pistol", "Shotgun", "Machine Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrossbow.\n\n\tDespite the elemental and seemingly-unreal capabilities garnered from the Plasmids found/bought throughout the game, Jack also makes use of some fairly conventional weapons including Pistols, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Grenade Launchers, and the accurate-yet-powerful Crossbow.  All of these weapons can hold multiple types of bullets suitable for use against specific enemies (some over others) and all of the weapons (excluding the Wrench) can be upgraded from the Power to the People machines scattered all over Rapture. None of the weapons of the game can be bought.  They can, however, be found and ammo machines can be found and hacked into quite easily. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these would you not be able to take a photo of for research purposes?", "correct": "Bathysphere", "options": ["Security camera", "Little Sister", "Splicer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathysphere.\n\n\tThe Research Camera is found fairly early in the game and it can hold up to 100 film.  This film can be found throughout the levels or in vending machines all over the map (and it's fairly cheap).  Research is important to the game because the more photos you take and the more you learn about the various creatures and security devices around Rapture, the more well-equipped you will be at defeating them. For example, photographing splicers is a great way to identify strong weapons against them and increase damage done in combat.  Certain tonics will upgrade the camera's efficiency as well.  You can equip the camera the same way you equip a weapon. \n"}, {"text": "Big Daddies come in two main forms: Bouncers and which of these?", "correct": "Rosies", "options": ["Leadheads", "Splicers", "Rapturers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRosies.\n\n\tBig Daddies have the tendency to walk around the corridors of Rapture protecting Little Sisters who emerge from the ventilation systems.  Rosies and Bouncers are the two main types of Big Daddies and both are fairly similar to one another in that they're stronger than most other enemies, they can charge you if need-be, and they'll just keep fighting to win.  When a Big Daddy falls, however, you can earn a fair amount of money from the corpse and retrieve your ADAM from the Little Sister...if there is one around.\rSearching through Point Prometheus, Jack will need to retrieve gear to effectively gain the powers of a Big Daddy. \n"}, {"text": "The final boss of the game is who of the following?", "correct": "Frank Fontaine", "options": ["Andrew Ryan", "Sander Cohen", "Brigid Tenenbaum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Fontaine.\n\n\tAfter racing through the Proving Grounds in Rapture's sprawling museum and escorting a Little Sister through the entire course, Jack will come across Fontaine's lair containing a machine that pumps him full of ADAM.  Using one of the Little Sisters' ADAM extractor needles, Jack needs to drain Frank four times (once at the very beginning of the battle) and shoot his health away in order to win. Each time he runs out of health, Frank will return to the machine, take on new powers, and heal.  When Jack finally takes enough ADAM from Frank, the battle will end and the Little Sisters will take over, extracting the remaining ADAM from him and uncannily poking him with extractor needles. \n"}]}
