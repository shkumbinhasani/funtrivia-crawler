But with the secession of Virginia from the United States, many representatives from the northwest counties organized a secondary Virginia government loyal to the Union.  They then proceeded with plans to form a new state made from the counties that were Union-loyal.  In 1862, an application for admission was submitted to the US Congress, and on the last day of that year, President Lincoln approved the admission of West Virginia if they rewrote their constitution to outlaw slavery.  They did so, and on April 20, 1863, Lincoln proclaimed their entry into the Union after 60 days: June 20, 1863.\r The closest Virginia now comes to Pennsylvania is Frederick County, VA, which itself is surrounded to the northeast and west by Jefferson, Berkeley, Morgan, and Hampshire Counties, WV. \n"}, {"text": "Which two states, which have borders made by the Mississippi River, only come within 33 miles of each other?", "correct": "Illinois & Tennessee", "options": ["Iowa & Kentucky", "Tennessee & Arkansas", "Minnesota & Illinois"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIllinois & Tennessee.\n\n\tTennessee and Illinois are separated by the western portions of Carlisle, Hickman, and Fulton counties, along with the eastern portion of Mississippi County, Missouri. \n"}, {"text": "Which two states that were among the first five admitted to the Union come within 11 miles of each other?", "correct": "New Jersey & Connecticut", "options": ["Pennsylvania & New Jersey", "Delaware & Pennsylvania", "Connecticut & Delaware"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Jersey & Connecticut.\n\n\tGreenwich, the westernmost town of Connecticut, is the closest point to the Rockleigh area of New Jersey.

They are ultimately named after the Kansa tribe, their name either meaning \"people of the wind\" or \"people of the south wind\".  The pronunciation of Arkansas was officially made ar-kan-saw after a dispute between the two US Senators from the state; the other senator wanted the pronunciation to rhyme with Kansas. \n"}, {"text": "Which two states (historically part of the territory of Texas) currently come only within 34 miles of Texas?", "correct": "Colorado & Kansas", "options": ["Kansas & Wyoming", "Wyoming & New Mexico", "New Mexico & Colorado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColorado & Kansas.\n\n\tThe Treaties of Velasco, which gave Texas definite boundaries, set the Republic of Texas to include not only the area of present-day Texas, but areas of Oklahoma (the Panhandle area), Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.  Later, when Texas was admitted to the US, territory north of 36\u00ba30' could not be slave territory. So this land was designated Public Land Strip, or colloquially \"No Man's Land\".  When Kansas was admitted, it only extended south to 37\u00ba, further delineating No Man's Land.  Further declarations of the territories of New Mexico and Colorado created an unassigned area later called Cimarron Territory. Then in 1890, it was assigned to Oklahoma Territory.  It and the rest of Oklahoma Territory became the State of Oklahoma in 1907. \n"}, {"text": "Which states, 50 miles apart, are separated by the northeast corner of Texas?", "correct": "Oklahoma & Louisiana", "options": ["Oklahoma & New Mexico", "Louisiana & Arkansas", "Arkansas & Oklahoma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOklahoma & Louisiana.\n\n\tBowie & Cass counties separate these two states.  \r Bowie Co. contains the Texas half of the city Texarkana, AR-TX (the post office's official name).

Massachusetts and Connecticut came forward with claims to the land under the original colonial grants which ran from sea-to-sea.  Through negotiation and the movement of Pennsylvania's western border, the Erie Triangle was appended to Erie County, PA.  This allowed the otherwise land-locked state access to the trade waters of the Great Lakes. \n"}, {"text": "Which two states, once part of the same state, are separated by about 15 miles of New Hampshire?", "correct": "Massachusetts & Maine", "options": ["Maine & Vermont", "Vermont & Rhode Island", "Rhode Island & Massachusetts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMassachusetts & Maine.\n\n\tMaine had been an exclave of Massachusetts until 1820.
