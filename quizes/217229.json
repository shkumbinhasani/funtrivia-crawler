{"id": "217229", "name": "Top Movies of 1996 Quiz | Movies by Year | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movies by Year", "1990s Movies"], "questions": [{"text": "While this dark and mildly disturbing comedy has fallen off of most people's charts, I find it emblematic of many problems facing human beings in modern society.  In the film, Jim Carrey plays an aggressively possessive 'friend' who forcibly inserts himself into the life of Matthew Broderick, a man recently jilted by his erstwhile girlfriend.  What is the title of this surreal Ben Stiller-directed film?", "correct": "The Cable Guy", "options": ["Bound", "Strange Days", "Reality Bites"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cable Guy.\n\n\tCheck out the supporting performances of then-unknowns Jack Black as Broderick's pal, Jeanine Garofalo and Andy Dick as waitress and host at 'Medieval Times' and Owen Wilson as the slick, wannabe suitor to Broderick's ex-girlfriend.  There are lots of film and television references to observe as well, especially the references to 'Star Trek' in the 'Medieval Times' scene.  This movie deserves to be watched. \n"}, {"text": "Well, heck yeah, you betcha!  So many sweet and unassuming people livin' up there in Minnesota, ya know?  The Coen Brothers dispelled this myth with their dark thriller that observes the underside of happy life in upper midwest America.  What is the name of this film, that sees Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) completely bungle through a plot to kidnap his wife, as the surprisingly clever policewoman, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), unravels the entire nasty affair?", "correct": "Fargo", "options": ["St. Paul", "Brainard", "Duluth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFargo.\n\n\tSpeaking what she termed as 'Minnesota Nice', Frances McDormand stole the show (and a Best Actress Oscar) for her performance in this Coen brothers-directed film.  Also not to be forgotten are the performances of Macy and the acting work of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the ruthless killers.  Rarely can a film make one laugh and feel numb with shock all at once, but 'Fargo' is such a film. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when a Hong Kong action heroine is requested to work on a poorly directed French film though she speaks no French?  You get this interesting and quirky little movie starring Maggie Cheung (as herself) and directed by Olivier Assayas.  What is its title?", "correct": "Irma Vep", "options": ["L' eau Froide", "D\u00e9sordre", "Filha da M\u00e3e"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIrma Vep.\n\n\tThe title 'Irma Vep' is an anagram of the word 'vampire', a reference to the film in which Cheung has been cast ('Les Vampires').  Maggie Cheung, who most Hong Kong film aficionados will easily recognize, is really genuine in this quasi-documentary style movie.  Check out this relatively unknown gem. \n"}, {"text": "In terms of good 1996 films, 'disturbing' is the key word.  Take the film 'Trainspotting', for example, which explores the lives of several Scottish drugged-out failures living the low life in Edinburgh.  Which of the following actors helps to make this difficult film one of 1996's best?", "correct": "Ewan McGregor", "options": ["Ian Holm", "Sean Connery", "Michael McKean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEwan McGregor.\n\n\tWith an essentially unknown cast, director Danny Boyle really does make the lives of the utter losers depicted in this film worth observing.  The movie is based on the novel by author Irvine Welsh. \n"}, {"text": "Certainly one of the most lively and amusing films of 1996 was 'The Birdcage', starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane as a gay couple whose son has chosen to marry the daughter of a U.S. senator.  'The Birdcage' is essentially a remake of a film originally released in 1978 in which country?", "correct": "France", "options": ["Germany", "India", "Australia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrance.\n\n\tThe French film was called 'La Cage aux folles'.  The American version was directed by veteran Mike Nichols and featured Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest, Hank Azaria, Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart alongside Williams and Lane.  For once, Robin Williams played the straight man (Armand) alongside Lane's zany performance as his drag queen companion (Albert). \n"}, {"text": "Oops, back to the disturbing.  In which 1996 film did Billy Bob Thornton take a turn as a mentally handicapped man, who has recently been released from a psychiatric hospital where he was confined after the murder of his mother and her secret lover?", "correct": "Sling Blade", "options": ["Secrets and Lies", "The Crucible", "Cold Comfort Farm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSling Blade.\n\n\tBilly Bob Thornton's performance is simply too shocking to believe as the semi-deranged Karl Childers.  Oddly enough, Thornton won an Oscar for the film, not for acting but for his screenplay (which was equally excellent).  Also worth note are the performances of Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter and Robert Duvall. \n"}, {"text": "Which type of restaurant do the characters in the film 'Big Night' attempt to save, by holding a special feast, complete with live jazz music?", "correct": "Italian", "options": ["Japanese", "French", "Mexican"], "explanation": "\n\n\nItalian.\n\n\t'Big Night' features Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub as Italian immigrant brothers whose lives revolve around their endangered restaurant.  Isabella Rossellini and Minnie Driver also appear in this very entertaining and hunger-inducing film. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most intense and thought-provoking films of 1996 was the memorable 'Get on the Bus'.  Featuring a nearly all black male cast, it was directed by which African American filmmaker?", "correct": "Spike Lee", "options": ["Ernest Dickerson", "Mario Van Peebles", "John Singleton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpike Lee.\n\n\tSpike Lee's 'Get on the Bus' was released at the one-year anniversary of the Million Man March on Washington, D.C.

Starring Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love, what name completes the title of the film:  'The People vs. __________'?", "correct": "Larry Flynt", "options": ["D. B. Cooper", "Howard Hughes", "Jerry Fallwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry Flynt.\n\n\tWoody Harrelson put in a positively stunning performance as Larry Flynt, infamous publisher of 'Hustler' magazine.  Lots of great supporting performances are given, most notably by Ed Norton, James Cromwell, Crispin Glover and political commentator James Carville. \n"}, {"text": "Last, but certainly not least, we have the first of several mockumentaries by Christopher Guest and company.  In this spoof, a company of 'actors' in Blaine, Missouri put on a show commemorating the 150th anniversary of the tiny town's founding.  What is the title of this rib-tickling classic?", "correct": "Waiting for Guffman", "options": ["For Your Consideration", "Best in Show", "A Mighty Wind"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaiting for Guffman.\n\n\tIn the tradition of 'This is Spinal Tap', also starring Christopher Guest, 'Waiting for Guffman' (and the follow up films 'Best in Show' and 'A Mighty Wind') feature the acting talents of Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy (co-writer), Parker Posey, Fred Willard and several other fun actors.
