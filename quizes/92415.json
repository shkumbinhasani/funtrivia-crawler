{"id": "92415", "name": "Christopher Marlowe Quiz | People | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "People Trivia", "People M-P"], "questions": [{"text": "Which work is NOT by Marlowe?", "correct": "Volpone", "options": ["Tamburlaine the Great", "The Jew of Malta", "Dr. Faustus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVolpone.\n\n\t\"Volpone\" is by Ben Jonson. The others are among Marlowe's best-known works. \n"}, {"text": "Marlowe also wrote poetry - including \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\". Who wrote a \"response\" to this poem?", "correct": "Walter Raleigh", "options": ["Ben Jonson", "William Shakespeare", "John Webster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Raleigh.\n\n\tMarlowe's poem - opening with the famous \"Come live with me and be my love\" - elicited a fine poetic response from Walter Raleigh. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is by Marlowe?", "correct": "Hero and Leander", "options": ["Every Man In His Humour", "Duchess of Malfi", "Spanish Tragedy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHero and Leander.\n\n\t\"Malfi\" is by Webster. \"Spanish\" is by Kyd. \"Humour\" is by Jonson. \r\"Hero\" is one of Marlowe's best-known poems. \n"}, {"text": "Which is true of Marlowe?", "correct": "He came from a humble background", "options": ["He was illegitimate", "He was a child of wealth", "He was an orphan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe came from a humble background.\n\n\tHe was the son of a shoemaker. From humble origins, this Elizabethan talent rose to triumph - and disaster. \n"}, {"text": "With what famous writer did Marlowe room?", "correct": "Thomas Kyd", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "Ben Jonson", "John Webster"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Kyd.\n\n\tTherein hangs a tale. When the Inquisition came poking around  (investigating heresy), poor Kyd ended up suffering a torture that left him a broken man. (Guilt by association?) He died shortly thereafter. Marlowe, however, was more fortunate. Why? Connections? \n"}, {"text": "Marlowe was apparently substantially involved in \"intelligence\" type activities. Why would he likely do this?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Money", "Reckless and adventurous nature", "Opportunity  to gain access to prominent people of prestige and  influence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tMarlowe was no choir boy. By most accounts, he was a hell-raiser - his talents notwithstanding . It seems well-established that he was engaged in \"espionage\" activities for one of the powers at Court - as was also the case for at least some of those who were present when Marlowe died. (This may have been the only common denominator that Marlowe shared with those present when he died.) \n"}, {"text": "Marlowe was in trouble at the time of his death: charges had been made against him and he was being investigated. What were these charges?", "correct": "Atheism and Heresy", "options": ["Plotting to overthrow the government", "Slander and libel", "Public drunkenness"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtheism and Heresy.\n\n\tAt that time, charges of atheism were made frequently - and didn't require a world of proof. Such charges could have deadly consequences. The Elizabethan world was filled with political intrigues and court struggles for favor and power. \n"}, {"text": "One of the people involved in Marlowe's death was also involved in \"the Babington plot\". Who was the target and intended victim of the plot?", "correct": "Queen Elizabeth", "options": ["Mary, Queen of Scots", "Earl of Essex", "Lord Walsinham"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth.\n\n\tThe plot involved nothing less than a plan to kill Elizabeth, rescue Mary, and bring about a Catholic invasion of England. It was poorly organized, however, and never came close to success. The perpetrators were \"busted\". \n"}, {"text": "How did Marlowe die?", "correct": "Stabbed in a fight", "options": ["Shot in a duel", "Poisoned", "Drowned under questionable circumstances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStabbed in a fight.\n\n\tThe death (in Deptford, near London, in 1593, at age 29) presents many unanswered questions. Marlowe was stabbed by a fellow named Ingram Frizer during a fight. The witnesses were Frizer's friends, Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. Frizer may have been a subordinate of Skeres: Skeres had ties to Essex (who was a strong political adversary of Raleigh's). It did not occur in a bar (as is often stated), but at the private home of Eleanor Bull (where one could, however, buy food and drink - a not unusual practice of the day). The timing of his death was \"interesting\"  - Marlowe was in some trouble. Moreover, what was Marlowe doing with these shady characters? \n"}, {"text": "What happened to the man who was charged with killing Marlowe?", "correct": "Exonerated due to self-defense", "options": ["Imprisoned", "Disappeared prior to any investigation", "Executed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExonerated due to self-defense.\n\n\tAn inquest was held and it was determined that Frizer had acted justifiably in self-defense. There was, therefore, no imprisonment or comparable punishment. Was it the truth - Marlowe had a temper and was known to mix it up a bit - or merely a political necessity for some of the powers of the day? \n"}]}
