He's considered by many to be the greatest artist in Norwegian history. \n"}, {"text": "Munch suffered through a number of unhappy and tragic events in his early life, and this becomes evident when viewing his works.  When he was only five years old, his mother expired at only 30 years of age.  How did her early death come about?  \n", "correct": "Tuberculosis", "options": ["Traffic accident", "Influenza", "Murder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuberculosis.\n\n\tSadly, Munch became motherless at the tender age of five years old, leaving his father to look after himself and four siblings.  Fortunately, one of Edvard's aunties, Karen Bjolstad, came to care for the children, and not coincidentally she happened to be an accomplished artist. \n"}, {"text": "Edvard faced tragedy again in 1877, when he was only fourteen years old.  His elder sister passed away this time, prompting one of his earliest works, a painting commemorating his beloved sister's death in 1885.

Edvard felt his life was cursed, and painted as a means of expressing his anguish at this realization.  'The Sick Child' is a touching painting, depicting a suffering young lady (Sophie) with her grieving brother (Edvard) at her side.

His paintings exhibited in Berlin were considered so 'radical' that the show was closed within a week and a split was caused among the art community in Berlin, the Berlin Sezession was formed as a result.  Munch gained immediate notoriety as a result of both the innovative nature of his paintings and the controversy surrounding their exhibition. \n"}, {"text": "During the early 1890s Munch began a series of works that he entitled 'The Frieze of Life'.  The most famous work of this series, and perhaps the most recognizable Munch painting of all, came from this series.  It depicts an individual upon a bridge, mouth agape, hands clasped at either side of the head.  What is the title of this well-known work?  \n", "correct": "The Scream", "options": ["Angry Soul", "Insanity", "The Torment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Scream.\n\n\tAlternatively titled 'The Cry' or 'The Shriek', 'The Scream' is probably the Munch painting with which most people identify the artist.  At the same time, the painting also may have been the one which the artist himself could have best identified emotionally, depicting the occasional horror of existence.  This beautiful, enigmatic work may be viewed in the national gallery at Oslo, or here: http://www.museumsnett.no/nasjonalgalleriet/munch/eng/innhold/fullsize/ngm00939.html \n"}, {"text": "In 1893, a bizarre incident occurred in Edvard's life.

Returning to her home, he discovered that it was all a ruse cooked up to reunite the two.  Edvard refused and began to make his way out, but not before the young lady produced a revolver and threatened to commit suicide. Believing her to once again be bluffing, he struggled to get the gun loose...and had the ends of two fingers shot off in the process.  The gun was indeed loaded!  Fortunately, this was not his painting hand.  Like the other aspects of his life, his love life was full of this sort of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. \n"}, {"text": "In the late 1890s Munch lived for a spell in Paris.

With which movement of poetry and painting was Mallarm\u00e9 a member?  \n", "correct": "Symbolist", "options": ["Fauvist", "Neo-Impessionist", "Nabis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSymbolist.\n\n\tMallarm\u00e9 was a founding member of the French symbolist movement which also included artists such as Gauguin.  Munch was a great admirer of Gauguin, one of the major influences on his work.  Munch also admired Mallarm\u00e9's work, and painted two portraits of the poet.  His association with the Symbolists lasted for only a couple of years, but the influence that they had on his painting was enormous. \n"}, {"text": "Munch's international fame grew by leaps and bounds during the early years of the 20th century, he exhibited throughout the world during these years and was even knighted in his home country.

He emerged several months later, in 1909, miraculously alcohol free!  Though bouts with unhappiness would continue occasionally, he dedicated much of his later career to less 'anguished' subjects, focusing on landscapes and portraits.  Though still 'expressionist' in his painting, the lack of this unhappy intensity took the edge off of his later stuff (imho). \n"}, {"text": "True or false: Much later in his life, while many artists and writers shunned the growing influence of fascism and Nazism in Europe, Munch embraced it.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNothing could be further from the truth!  When the Nazis gained power and influence in Norway, thanks to the traitor Quisling, Munch refused all contact with the Nazis, despite their efforts to recruit him.  In return, his artwork was labeled 'Degenerate' by the Nazis. \n"}, {"text": "True of false: Though most of the people in his family died very young, Munch lived to a ripe old age, dying soon after his 80th birthday.  \n", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, though his mother, sister and father died at rather young ages, Munch lived a long and full life.  He died of bronchitis in 1944, soon after his 80th birthday, in his native Norway.  He bequeathed most of the remaining works in his possession to the city of Oslo, not having any natural heirs.  Many of these works can still be viewed in the National Gallery in Oslo, it's certainly worth a look!  Thanks for having a go at this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it.  If you did and would like more, I have a number of other 'portraits' for you to view...I invite you to have a look.  Thanks! \n"}]}
