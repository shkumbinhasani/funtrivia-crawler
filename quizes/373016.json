{"id": "373016", "name": "\"Magical Thinking\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Freak Show"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of Jimmy's lobster hands is removed?", "correct": "Both", "options": ["Neither", "Left", "Right"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoth.\n\n\tJimmy, knowing no other way out, admits he has nothing to give and realizes that Stanley's option-- to give up one of his lobster hands-- is ideal.  Stanley gives him a bottle of expectorant and within moments he's retching enough for the cops to be concerned.  It doesn't take long for an ambulance to arrive, especially with Stanley's urging. Behind the wheel is Stanley's boy toy.  Stanley anesthetizes Jimmy and, before he knows it, the operation is complete...he's in a county hospital.  He'll be back in prison in another day.  When he looks over he finds that not one of his lobster hands is missing, but both of them are. \n"}, {"text": "Chester raises and sells which of these?", "correct": "Chameleons", "options": ["Iguanas", "Guinea pigs", "Cats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChameleons.\n\n\tBette and Dot are happy to be back at the freak show grounds amongst people of their kind, especially since the both of them are eager to give in to the pure pleasure the freaks live with.  The two of them have one goal: to spend the night with someone they decide to lose their virginity to.  That day, the two of them decide to destroy their journals and no longer keep secrets from one another.\rWhen they head to the big tent, someone has interrupted their rehearsal to sell his wares.  His name is Chester and he raises chameleons in Georgia.  When he looks up at the twins, he sees two other women.  The girls assume he's making eyes at them. \n"}, {"text": "What is Chester's talent?", "correct": "Magic", "options": ["Art", "Contortion", "Psychic powers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMagic.\n\n\tChester informs the freaks that he was wounded in the war but, fortunately, he's A-OK.  He has since had a metal plate put into his head.  When he heard about the freak show he had to come down; he's a magician and he wants a job.  Bette and Dot are enamoured with Chester's charm and think that, potentially, he could be the one.\rDell finds Jimmy in his hospital bed without his lobster hands and immediately assumes that the police did it.  When Dell finds out that Stanley was responsible, he feels sympathy for his son, more so when he has to feed him for the first time.  Jimmy tells Dell that he plans to buy the freak show from Elsa; Dell plans to join him. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the first person to witness Marjorie?", "correct": "Elsa", "options": ["Eve", "Bette", "Maggie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElsa.\n\n\tChester seeks an audience with Elsa and it quickly becomes apparent that she has no real interest in taking on a magician.  To salvage what he can of their meeting, Chester brings up his second unique quirk-- Marjorie, his ventriloquist dummy.  Chester's connection with his dummy is admirable, but Elsa still isn't convinced; she has no real openings for him.  Chester works any angle he can and shows his bookkeeping for his chameleon sales.  When Elsa reads his books she hires him to do the finances for the freak show and, on occasion, warm up the crowd. \n"}, {"text": "Who offers to help Dell spring Jimmy from prison?", "correct": "Eve", "options": ["Paul", "Stanley", "Maggie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEve.\n\n\tBackstage, Chester prepares his make-up for his warm-up well in advance and argues with Marjorie about the fact that they aren't billed any for their performance.  Paul walks in on Chester's 'conversation', but the magician brushes it off as rehearsal.\rEve and Suzi assist Elsa as she packs her clothing for Hollywood.  When Dell arrives, he searches Elsa's tent for Stanley but finds that he's not there.  Elsa becomes worried when she finds out that Jimmy is not only in prison, but has lost his hands, but it's Eve who steps up, following Dell and offering the 'Strong Man/'Strong Woman' act so that they can save Jimmy. \n"}, {"text": "Chester, reflecting on Bette and Dot's beauty, says that they remind him of which of these?", "correct": "Old friends", "options": ["Marjorie", "His mother", "His ex-wife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld friends.\n\n\tBette and Dot are visited by Chester in their tent where he decides to thank them for their support.  He kindly gives them a gift-- a music box-- which they're thrilled with, but the biggest surprise is what Elsa offered him: free reign of the prop tent.  There, he found a great deal of Dell's bric-a-brac including Harry Houdini's water tank and a genuine sawing box. Chester asks the girls to be his assistants so that they can distract with their beauty and they're initially worried as to why, but he assures them it's because they remind him of old friends from home.  What they don't know is that these old friends are his wife and her lover who he used to watch, in bed, with Marjorie. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when Dell frees Jimmy?", "correct": "He gets shot", "options": ["He takes his place", "Jimmy turns himself in", "He gets hit by a car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe gets shot.\n\n\tThe police arrive to take Jimmy back to jail from the hospital, but the ride is interrupted quite abruptly when Amazon Eve throws a brick through their windshield.  The cops exit the vehicle to get back at her, but she and Dell are able to subdue...and kill...the police (though not before Dell is shot in the arm).  They pull Jimmy out of the vehicle.\rBette and Dot prepare themselves to spend the night with Chester and enter his caravan during an intense argument with Marjorie.  Fortunately, they're able to pull his mind away by offering themselves up, but he ends up hearing an intense ringing; his head, where the metal plate was inserted, aches.  He remembers his wife and her lover taunting him while he sat on the sidelines, but the girls are able to calm him down enough.  Unfortunately, he can't take himself away from the doll while they make love. \n"}, {"text": "Chester purchases the freak show, but for how much money?", "correct": "$1,000", "options": ["$500", "$5,000", "Absolutely nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$1,000.\n\n\tDandy gets some bad news; Detective Colquitt watched as Dot and Bette slept with Chester in his caravan and took photographic evidence for his new employer.  \rThe next day, Chester forces Marjorie to go away into her crate, forcing him to recall the horrible things his wife's lover did to the doll when he wasn't looking.  It was then that he had to take Marjorie's word to heart.  He needed to get these women out of the picture.\rFortunately, Chester's life is looking better.  He toasts with Elsa as they make the deal; Chester will get the freak show for $1,000.  She knew he would be a great owner when she saw his bookkeeping skills.  He, and Marjorie as it seems, are thrilled, even though Elsa insists that all acts stay in the proper order.  Elsa does, however, find it odd that Chester plans to give the dummy her tent and make her the headliner. \n"}, {"text": "When Marjorie goes missing, who, as it turns out, has taken her?", "correct": "Dandy", "options": ["Elsa", "Paul", "No one; Marjorie actually left on her own"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDandy.\n\n\tChester, thrilled with his business deal, returns to his trailer to find that Marjorie has gone missing; she's no longer in her crate.\rThe police show up at the freak show grounds searching for Jimmy but there's no sign of him.  Dell and Eve are both present.  The search is interrupted, however, when Chester, hysterical, begs the cops to help him find his missing Marjorie.  The cops tear the place apart but find nothing and leave.  Chester, meanwhile, inevitably finds Dandy out at the carousel and is told that Marjorie ran away, angry that the twins spent the night with him.  Dandy, knowing the details full well, also claims that Marjorie plans on telling everyone about Chester's wife and her lover, Alice, though Chester claims he never touched them-- it was all Marjorie's fault.  He came home to find Marjorie already butchering them with a hammer.  Dandy says that Marjorie is in the big tent.  She's there, but she insists that he needs to kill the twins. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Dell, shooting him in the head?", "correct": "Elsa", "options": ["Desiree", "Jimmy", "Stanley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElsa.\n\n\tMaggie and Desiree return from their trip to the American Museum of Morbidity and Maggie asks Elsa to come with her.  Dell, meanwhile, returns to his trailer to find Desiree with a gun.  She puts it down at his request, but she doesn't want to hear him talk.  She doesn't care about the lies about his lifestyle, but she knows about the people he's killed. He insists he killed the cops, but refuses to admit to anyone else.  Unfortunately for him, she knows he killed one of his own.  Maggie shows Elsa Ma Petite in her glass jar and arrives just in time to hear Dell admit it to Des.  He doesn't see Elsa come up behind him; she shoots him in the head. \n"}]}
