{"id": "406593", "name": "\"Game Over\" Trivia Game | American Horror Story | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "American Horror Stories"], "questions": [{"text": "Michelle's \"American Horror Story\" video game originally involves a couple staying at the Los Angeles murder house under what condition?", "correct": "They're staying at an AirBNB", "options": ["They've inherited it", "They're investigative journalists", "They've broken in"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey're staying at an AirBNB.\n\n\tAn Uber pulls up in front of the infamous Los Angeles murder house as two \"American Horror Story\" fans peel out of the vehicle and ogle at the structure (despite their driver's hesitance to go anywhere near the gate).  They claim to have rented the house for the night; the owners have offered it up as an AirBNB 'Escape From the Murder House' experience.  They grab their bag and head inside.\r There's plenty to keep the couple occupied when they enter the building; a note on the kitchen counter welcomes them and directs them to follow the black rose petals up to the bedroom where Violet and Tate consummated their relationship.  After a glass of wine, they waste no time. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters is anachronistically featured in an early version of Michelle's video game?", "correct": "Twisty the Clown", "options": ["Piggyman", "Addie Langdon", "The infantata"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwisty the Clown.\n\n\tReaching the bedroom upstairs, the couple finds that the candles are already lit for them.  They undress and prepare to make the most of the space but there's little time to relax, especially when the noises and whispers commence.  They don't notice the people walking through the halls...at least not until they come across the body of a nurse at the bottom of the stairs.  When she gets to her feet and walks into the basement they follow behind believing it to be part of the immersive experience but it's a bit more than that.\r It's fun and games until they come across three girls that they don't remember from the show, trapped behind what appears to be bars.  The girls claim to be trick-or-treaters who arrived at the house on Halloween ten years ago, and due to some poor decision making on their part they were killed by the denizens of the building.  When the couple is attacked by the infantata, Addie Langdon, Bloodyface, and Twisty the Clown, they know something is amiss.  The truth is that they aren't real.\r The entire experience is part of a video game.  And it's game over. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Michelle's son?", "correct": "Rory", "options": ["Ben", "Dylan", "Tate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRory.\n\n\tWhen her son, Rory, loses the \"American Horror Story\" video game, Michelle is a bit disappointed that there are still bugs in her build.  While the graphics look great, Rory is more frustrated that the game revisits the murder house but doesn't stay true to the season.  Addie, for instance, never returned as a ghost since she died off the property; Bloodyface was in \"Asylum\" while Twisty the Clown was only in \"Freak Show\" and \"Cult\".  Rory is a superfan of the show and Michelle is not. He explains that she's not getting it.  She needs the game to work out, and she thought it would be a way she could connect with her son. Rory decides to go to his dad's for a few weeks. \n"}, {"text": "At what price, below land value, does Michelle offer to purchase the murder house?", "correct": "$100,000", "options": ["She breaks in instead", "$5,000,000", "$600,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$100,000.\n\n\tMichelle throws on some old episodes of \"American Horror Story\" to continue her research but days of trawling through \"Murder House\" only allow her to get so far in understanding the deep, emotional core of the show.\r She ends up at the house one day, taking a tour of the property and speaking to the real estate agent about the possibility of owning the house.  Due to its obvious, sordid history, the bank is willing to sell it for land value (about $600,000) or best offer.  Michelle offers a sixth of that price (though she doesn't have the money).  Her plan?  Simply get inside and let the secrets roll out before her. \n"}, {"text": "Michelle lets her son know that she's planning to write to the creators of \"American Horror Story\" to learn more about the murder house.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhen Halloween rolls around, Michelle makes a point of stopping at her ex-husband's place to drop of clothes.  She lets Rory know that she'll be going to a horror convention to speak to the creators of \"American Horror Story\" and get the truth straight from them.  She doesn't dwell; the family thinks she has blinders on and that she won't stop, but she assures them that this is her ticket to success.\r Really she's headed to the murder house to unearth the truth from within.  As she returns to the property, many of the ghosts head out for the evening, intending to use Halloween to stretch beyond the walls of the house.  Ruby greets her at the door before Scarlett arrives and, to Michelle's surprise, they head inside with no hesitation.  The problem seems to be that Michelle can't seem to find anyone inside. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these ghosts does Michelle speak to when she spends Halloween in the house?", "correct": "Ben Harmon", "options": ["Constance Langdon", "Tate Langdon", "Lawrence Harvey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Harmon.\n\n\tRuby and Scarlett enjoy a bath together and share the evening.  Ruby asks Scarlett if she's ever considered the possibility of leaving the house, perhaps in a 'put her soul to rest' way.  Scarlett, depressed, waits for Halloween every year and little else.\r Though Michelle searches the house for people and answers, it takes a good deal of wandering through the rooms before she comes across any sign whatsoever.  In the sitting room she finds Ben Harmon weeping to himself.  She admits she's making a video game about the house but she's creatively stuck.  Ben unloads on her despite the fact that Michelle believes he's making it all up.  The problem is that he feels like he's in Hell. \n"}, {"text": "Michelle is killed when she stays in the murder house, but by whom?", "correct": "Scarlett", "options": ["The Piggyman", "Addie", "Violet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScarlett.\n\n\tAll Michelle wants is the experience.  As she explains to Ben, she wants to know the fear, the emotion, and the fun of the Murder House so that she can convey it in her work.  Her video game needs to have a purpose, but as Ben says, the murder house is simply dull and purposeless.  There needs to be an escape, Michelle reasons, and that might come from its inhabitants breaking the cycle.\r When Ben leaves her to herself for a moment, Michelle is found by Ruby and Scarlett, the latter in the rubbersuit.  Ben returns to help her, but he's unable to get her out before she's killed.  Just another soul to join the numbers in the murder house. \n"}, {"text": "How do Ruby and Scarlett end their Halloween night?", "correct": "With a kiss", "options": ["By handing each other written letters", "By driving into the sunset", "By getting into bed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith a kiss.\n\n\tOne year after Michelle's death, on Halloween, she heads to her ex-husband's house to find Rory heading out for the night.  He chastises her for what she did-- as soon as they received the calls that she tried to buy the murder house, he knew she was never coming back.  The problem is that he could never forgive her for following her obsession to the end.  He suggests that the only way to end the cycle is to set the place on fire, burning it and purifying it, but she begs him not to destroy it.  He promises he won't.\r As another Halloween night comes to an end, the ghosts of the murder house once more return to the building.  As Michelle heads in, Scarlett and Ruby share a sunrise kiss and part ways once again. \n"}, {"text": "How is the murder house destroyed?", "correct": "It's set on fire", "options": ["It falls into a sinkhole", "An earthquake razes it", "A wrecking crew smashes it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's set on fire.\n\n\tAs Scarlett leaves the murder house, Rory arrives with canisters of gasoline.  As he starts pouring gas on the house, Scarlett, eager to remain a ghost, heads downstairs to stop him, but she herself is held back by the other ghosts.  They incapacitate her and watch as potential salvation looms outside.  With what final moments she can, Ruby texts Scarlett with the word HELP and she rushes back.\r Outside, Michelle thanks her son for finally doing what no one else could.  Ruby tries, with her last efforts, to get to Rory and stop him from striking the match, but neither she nor Scarlett is able to prevent him from sparking the flame that sets the house on fire.  As the flames rise, Ruby asks Scarlett to burn with her, but she refuses.\r By the end of the day, the house burns down.  One of the most notorious house in the world is gone for good. \n"}, {"text": "Does Michelle ever finish creating her video game?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThree years after the murder house burns down, Scarlett pulls up in front of the new Los Angeles condos that occupy the former murder house lot.  The real estate agent shows her to the final unit in the building and is candid about the hallowed grounds they built on.  In the six months since he sold the other condo units, there have been no apparition sightings.  Scarlett buys it nonetheless; it's a million dollar unit.  As she unpacks her meagre belongings, Scarlett lights candles in the bathroom and slides into the tub.  She cries for Ruby before sliding into bed.  It's there that Ruby, dressed in the rubbersuit, appears before her.  While the other ghosts moved on, she wanted to stay, knowing Scarlett would come back to her.\r As Ruby and Scarlett are reunited, the camera pulls back and the ending screen for the 'Escape From Murder House' game begins its narration.  Rory lets Michelle know that version 2.0 is much better than the first; he loves it.  As they head out, they wonder what might have happened to the ghosts who left the murder house.  Then again, it's only just a story. \n"}]}
