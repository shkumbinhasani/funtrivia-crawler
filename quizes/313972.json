{"id": "313972", "name": "\"Harper's Island\" Quiz | Harper's Island | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Harper's Island"], "questions": [{"text": "Which character brought a bag containing $250,000 to Harper's Island?", "correct": "Uncle Marty", "options": ["Hunter", "Richard", "Cousin Ben"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUncle Marty.\n\n\t\"Harper's Island\" takes place on the titular island itself during the wedding of Henry Dunn and Trish Wellington.  They bring their entire party to the island for the festivities, but little do they know, a murderer, John Wakefield, has returned to this sleepy locale off the coast from Seattle, and there's no escape.\rUncle Marty becomes one of the first wedding guests to be killed in the show's run, in the series premiere, \"Whap\".  As he's walking across a bridge, it breaks, forcing him to get stuck halfway through.  Without him knowing, the killer sneaks up underneath and cuts him in half, then takes his body and hangs it in the trees.  JD and Abby find the body in the forest in the sixth episode, \"Sploosh\".  The money brought to the island by Uncle Marty causes a bit of commotion, causing Booth's death in episode four.  Uncle Marty originally brought the money to Harper's Island to invest in Malcolm's beer. \n"}, {"text": "What's the name of Lucy's dog, found on the island after she was killed?", "correct": "Gigi", "options": ["Misha", "Belle", "Rex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGigi.\n\n\tLucy was one of three characters killed in the show's second episode, \"Crackle\".  One of Trish's bridesmaids, Lucy really had a minimal role in the preceding events.  John Wakefield ended up killing Lucy when she was looking in the forest for her small toy dog, Gigi, but she fell into a pit trap on the path. While in the hole, he dumped lighter fluid on her and struck a match, leaving her to burn.  Gigi later distracts Trish and her father, Thomas, while the two are on a bike ride through the forests.  Unfortunately, the two have a number of deadly run-ins- the two are knocked off their bikes by a large tree trap and are attacked by an angry dog unleashed by Cole Harkin. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the bar on Harper's Island?", "correct": "The Cannery & Cannery", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cannery & Cannery.\n\n\tThe Cannery is seen in various episodes though none of the events there are as important as ones in later episodes where a number of the locals (Shane, Nikki, and Maggie) are killed in and around the pub.  Although a number of lighter moments occur here (such as Cal and Chloe trying to retrieve their lost engagement ring from a happy, newly-engaged couple), the Cannery is just one of the many places the survivors try to find refuge, but don't succeed. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Thomas Wellington murdered?", "correct": "Church", "options": ["Candlewick Inn", "Forest", "In his boat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChurch.\n\n\tIn the fifth episode of \"Harper's Island\" (entitled \"Thwack\"), Trish and her father take a less-than-safe bike ride through the forests of Harper's Island and she informs him that her stepmother has been cheating on her father with Richard, her brother-in-law.  The shock is short-lived for Thomas though. In the same episode, everyone gathers for the wedding rehearsal and he's killed by a head spade dropped from the main chandelier (when Abby flips a switch to turn it on).  This major death triggers the wedding party's realization that not everything is as it seems on Harper's Island.  Many suspect the perpetrator to be Henry Dunn's brother, JD, but he too is killed. Abby finds him stabbed at the end of the eighth episode, \"Gurgle\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Shea's daughter?", "correct": "Madison", "options": ["Kelly", "Katherine", "Beth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadison.\n\n\tMadison is the only child to attend the wedding.  The daughter of Shea and Richard Allen, Madison is at the wedding to act as flower girl for her aunt, Trish.  Madison plays a large role in the plotline having been the only one to have contact with John Wakefield through the majority of the story (but not knowing his intentions).  Madison is kidnapped in the end of the seventh episode, \"Thrack, Splat, Sizzle\" and main group from the wedding party is warned that if they leave the island, she will be killed. Abby finds Madison in the ninth episode, \"Seep\", when the group discovers passageways underneath the Candlewick and surrounding sites. Madison, having been kept in good health by Wakefield, returns to the group.  On many occasions, Madison is kept out of the loop, and this results in her forgetting to reveal important information about the killer(s). \n"}, {"text": "How does Sheriff Mills die?", "correct": "He is hanged", "options": ["He is set on fire", "He is stabbed", "He is buried alive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is hanged.\n\n\tWhile the survivors hide at The Cannery for refuge, Abby is asked to speak to her father at her room at the Candlewick in episode nine, \"Snap\".  Under the impression that she may be John Wakefield's daughter, he reveals that she is his own daughter, but her mother did sleep with Wakefield, causing him to come to the island to commit his first slew of murders.  After this, Sheriff Mills is killed by Wakefield who set the situation up as a trap.  He pulls the Sheriff out the window with his car, snapping his neck and hanging him in a tree, the same way as Abby's mother.\rSheriff Mills has been on the case for many years, trying to determine Wakefield's whereabouts.  His attic is filled with information which may lead to the identity of a copycat, and much of it is true, but Madison and Shea do come across a number of red herrings amongst the files. \n"}, {"text": "Do Cal and Chloe get engaged?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tChloe is one of Trish's bridesmaids while Cal is simply 'along for the ride', simply joining his girlfriend on the trip.  The two are an extremely likable pair, and their deaths are perhaps some of the biggest shocks of the series.  Chloe is captured by John Wakefield from a secret passageway in the church and she is locked away in a storm drain in the show's eleventh episode, \"Splash\".  When Cal finds and rescues her, the two get trapped at the top of a bridge by John Wakefield. Before they're attacked, Cal finally proposes to Chloe, something that he had been waiting for the right moment to do since they got to the island. Cal, who had already been shot in the arm by Wakefield in an earlier episode, is stabbed with a boarding knife in an attempt to get Chloe to climb across the blocked bridge.  Realizing she can't escape, she tells Wakefield that he can't have her and she commits suicide by falling into the water of her own will.  She is one of only a few characters not directly murdered in the show's run. \n"}, {"text": "Trish is killed by John Wakefield.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe twelfth episode, \"Gasp\", begins with Wakefield being captured by Sully and Danny and being taken to jail, but unfortunately, he escapes with the help of his accomplice and continues to wipe out the survivors.  While Shea and Madison escape the police station, Danny is impaled by a memo holder.  Trish, not knowing that Wakefield is on the loose again, suits up in her wedding dress one last time as he breaks in.  She escapes out the bedroom window and runs down the forest path, but comes across his accomplice, who stabs her in the side with a knife. \n"}, {"text": "Who worked with John Wakefield to commit the murders?", "correct": "Henry Dunn", "options": ["Jimmy Mance", "Abby Mills", "Chris \"Sully\" Sullivan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Dunn.\n\n\tWith Trish killed by her fianc\u00e9, only five of the survivors are left in the final episode, \"Sigh\".  Inevitably, in the church, Abby discovers that Henry was responsible for the copycat killings.  She is nearly killed by Wakefield, but Henry shoots him to protect her.  She faints as a rescue copter flies across the sky.\rWhen Abby awakens, she finds herself in a seaside home.  Henry admits to everything.  He realized that he always wanted to be with Abby since living on the island during summers, but she reveals that the two are related as they both had the same mother.  Nonetheless, Henry persists and reveals that he is planning to frame Jimmy, who he has tied up in a shed.  Of the twenty-nine victims on Harper's Island, Henry killed eleven in order to live happily with Abby. \n"}, {"text": "How many major characters from the original wedding party escape the island?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tBoth Abby and Jimmy survive the attacks on the island with Abby finally killing Henry once and for all on the shores of Harper's Island with a boarding knife.  Both of them are the only ones to last the duration of the show without being killed by John Wakefield or Henry, but Jimmy was never part of the original wedding party.  Shea and Madison also survive the ordeal having been sent away from the island by Sully, who finds a small boat in the boathouse discovered on a quiet beach.  He tells them to head to Seattle and warns the Coast Guard that the two are departing, but stays on the island to help Henry find an already-deceased Trish.  Henry kills him in the woods.\rShea and Madison are later questioned by the police on shore and Shea is told that there were no other survivors except for a small handful of locals. \n"}]}
