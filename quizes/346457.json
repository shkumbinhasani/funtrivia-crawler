{"id": "346457", "name": "Speed Demon Quiz / Test | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Abstract Ideas"], "questions": [{"text": "As a Speed Demon, what is the fastest land animal?", "correct": "Cheetah", "options": ["Impala", "Lion", "Hyena"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheetah.\n\n\tThe cheetah is the fastest animal on land and the main reason for that is that its favorite prey is the gazelle, who is also an extremely fast animal. In fact, it's the only animal that comes close to a cheetah's speed. Thus, in order to avert starvation, the cheetah absolutely must run very fast. Although the cheetah can run up to 70 miles per hour he can only keep up that speed for 200-300 yards, so he must still be able to sneak up on the gazelle. \n"}, {"text": "Another Speed Demon is the world's fastest land snake, whose name belies its color?", "correct": "Black mamba", "options": ["Red-tailed racer snake", "Coachwhip snake", "King cobra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack mamba.\n\n\tExcept for the inside of his mouth, which is black, the black mamba is gray. If you see black, you've gotten too close and have provoked him. Over level land he can reach top speeds of 10-12 miles per hour, but only in short bursts. It would still be well nigh impossible to outrun one. They can get to be up to 14 feet in length.When they run they hold their head up about one-third of their body is off the ground. They are very aggressive snakes and since they spring up to strike, they could get to chin level on a lot of people. Without medical treatment the death rate of the bitten is 100%. Although they don't usually attack humans, they are greatly feared in their endemic areas. \n"}, {"text": "The holy grail of horse racing is the Triple Crown, comprising of the Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and the Preakness. Which speed demon horse not only won all three races in 1973, but set records for the fastest race time?", "correct": "Secretariat", "options": ["Spectacular Bid", "Sham", "Seattle Slew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecretariat.\n\n\tSecretariat set record times in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes in 1973, winning the latter by an astounding 31 lengths. In the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Crown, there was a timing error that didn't register the ending of the race, and the officials gave him an \"official\" time that was nearly two seconds slower than assumed.Horse racing pundits have viewed the films of his run and believe that Secretariat would have the record of this race as well had the timing error not occurred. Many horses have had a \"5th gear\" that other horses around it don't have, but no horse before or since Secretariat had the ability to start that 5th gear so early in a race and make it last as long as he did. \n"}, {"text": "Every speed demon has speed. What formula can a speed demon use to calculate their speed?", "correct": "Speed = Distance/Time", "options": ["Speed = Time/Distance", "Speed = Distance + 1/2 time", "Speed = Distance x Time"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed = Distance/Time.\n\n\tThe speed formula (or velocity formula) commonly shortens to v = d/t. The formula for acceleration however is different. To calculate that, you would need to take the final velocity, subtract the initial velocity, and divide by time. \n"}, {"text": "In 1995, speed demon Fred Rompelberg set a Guinness World Record speed of 167 mph (268 km/h) by doing what?", "correct": "Riding a bicycle", "options": ["Skydiving", "Hitting a golf ball", "Driving illegally on an highway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiding a bicycle.\n\n\tOn the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, Dutchman Fred Rompelberg rode a $12,000 bicycle and used a dragster pace car as a wind barrier. He got to a top speed of 167 mph. The record stands for more than fifteen years, an eternity as far as speed records go since people all strive to be the top dog in the record books. The other choices all have records faster than 167 mph, but none of them require as much consistent human power. \n"}, {"text": "A Japanese anime program called Mach Go Go Go was adapted into an American version that ran for two seasons beginning in 1967. The show was then used as the basis of a 2008 movie starring Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci and John Goodman.
