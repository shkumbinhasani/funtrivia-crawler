{"id": "359890", "name": "ONE Quiz | Sports Upsets | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Wide World of Sports", "  Sports Upsets"], "questions": [{"text": "The New York Yankees can justifiably claim to be #1 in Major League Baseball, with more World Series wins than any other franchise, but for which former player did they retire the #1 shirt?", "correct": "Billy Martin", "options": ["Babe Ruth", "Joe DiMaggio", "Yogi Berra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBilly Martin.\n\n\tThe Yankees have retired more than any other MLB franchise. The first number retired by the Yankees was Lou Gehrig's #4, on Independence Day 1939. Nearly a decade later, in 1948, Babe Ruth's #3 was added to the wall behind the left field fence in the old Yankee Stadium. Joe DiMaggio's #5 joined the collection in 1952 and Mickey Mantle's #7 was added in 1969. The Yankees retired the #8 shirt in 1972 in honour of two former catchers and managers, Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey. The Yankees retired the #1 shirt in 1986 in honour of former second baseman and manager Billy Martin. \n"}, {"text": "In soccer, the goalkeeper traditionally wears #1. Which of these goalkeepers was, when he retired, number one on the list of most competitive games played?", "correct": "Peter Shilton", "options": ["Ray Clemence", "David Seaman", "Pat Jennings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPeter Shilton.\n\n\tEngland legend Peter Shilton retired in 1997 having played more competitive games than any player in the history of the game -- a remarkable 1,390 matches. Shilton also finished his career with more caps for England than any player in history -- 125 appearances for his country. The alternatives are three more goalkeepers who also played in over 1,000 competitive matches -- Pat Jennings 1096 (retired 1986), Ray Clemence 1118 (retired 1988) and David Seaman 1047 (retired 2004). The only non-goalkeeper in the top five when Seaman retired was Alan Ball (retired 1983), who played 1,054 matches. \n"}, {"text": "The Epson Derby is one of the oldest of the world's classic horse races and the winningest jockey, Lester Piggott, recorded the first of his nine victories in 1954 riding which horse?", "correct": "Never Say Die", "options": ["Teenoso", "Pinza", "Diomed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever Say Die.\n\n\tAmerican-bred Never Say Die won just once in his first nine races, but he carried Lester Piggott to his first Derby success in 1954 and then followed that by winning the St Leger by a record 12 lengths later that same year. The alternatives were also all winners of the Derby: Teenoso provided Piggott with his last Derby win (in 1983), Pinza was the mount of Sir Gordon Richards when he scored his only Derby win (in 1953), and Diomed was the winner of the first ever Derby (in 1780). \n"}, {"text": "Professional ice hockey began as a strictly Canadian affair and, since the Stanley Cup Final era began in 1915, the Montreal Canadiens have dominated the competition. They were the first team to win the Standley Cup twenty times. Which U.S. franchise was the first to win ten Stanley Cup Finals?", "correct": "Detroit Red Wings", "options": ["Boston Bruins", "New York Rangers", "Chicago Blackhawks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetroit Red Wings.\n\n\tFrom the beginning of the modern era in 1915, the Montreal Canadiens won their 20th Stanley Cup Final in 1977. \rThe #1 American franchise is the Detroit Red Wings, who won their 10th title in 2002. Their closest contenders were the Bruins, who had won five titles (their 5th came in 1972) when the Red Wings won their tenth; the Blackhawks had won three (their third was in 1961) and the New York Rangers had four victories (their fourth was in 1994). \n"}, {"text": "Test match cricketers don't wear numbers, but there's little doubt about the identity of the #1 batsman of all time. Against which test match country did he average more than 200 runs?", "correct": "South Africa", "options": ["India", "England", "West Indies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSouth Africa.\n\n\tBorn Donald George Bradman in Cootamundra, New South Wales, Australia in 1908, his 99.94 runs/inning test batting average is a record that is unlikely ever to be broken. In that respect, it is on a par with Cy Young's 511 wins (baseball) and Brett Favre's 297 consecutive regular season starts (321 if you count playoff games) at quarterback. \rBradman averaged a remarkable 201.50 runs in the one and only series (five macthes) he played against South Africa, with four centuries and a 299*. He averaged 178.75 against India, 89.78 against England and 74.50 against the West Indies, for a career test average of 99.94.\rBradman's first-class average wasn't exactly shabby either -- 95.14 (110.19 in the Sheffield Shield) with a highest score of 452*. He was even a reasonable bowler -- he took 36 first-class wickets at an average of 37.97. \n"}, {"text": "After becoming the first athlete to win the \"double double\", there can be little doubt about the identity of the world's #1 all-time sprinter. What, though, is Usain Bolt's middle name?", "correct": "St. Leo", "options": ["Trelawny", "St. Thomas", "St. Andrew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSt. Leo\n\n\tBorn Usain St.Leo Bolt in Trelawny, Jamaica in 1986, he is arguably the greatest exponent of track & field ever. At the 2012 London Olympics he was the first athlete to win both the 100m and 200m sprints at consecutive Olympics (the \"double double\"). There is little doubt that he would be in the mix along with the likes of Sir Steve Redgrave, Nadia Comaneci and Paavo Nurmi in a poll to find the greatest ever Olympian.\rThe alternatives answers, by the way, are all Jamaican parishes. \n"}, {"text": "On a rugby union team the #1 (and the #3) is worn by the heart of the front row, the prop forwards. By 2003 three of these four legendary props had been inducted into either or both the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the iRB Hall of Fame. Which one had *not* been inducted into either Hall of Fame?", "correct": "Os du Randt", "options": ["Syd Millar", "Jason Leonard", "Wilson Whineray"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOs du Randt.\n\n\tOs du Randt was the most-capped Springbok forward in history when he retired in 2007 with 80 caps. He had not yet retired by 2003 when the other three were admitted into one of the Halls of Fame.\r-- England's Jason Leonard OBE, retired in 2001 with a world record 119 test caps (114 for England and 5 for the British & Irish Lions), although Australia's George Gregan has since surpassed that total. Leonard became only the fourth English player in the International Hall of Fame in 2007. \r-- The late Sir Wilson Whineray is the all-time longest-serving captain of the All Blacks, playing 77 times between 1957 and 1965, the last 67 as captain. He joined the International Hall in 1999 and was the first New Zealander inducted into the IRB HoF in 2007.\r-- Between 1958 and 1970, Syd Millar CBE MBE played 37 tests for Ireland and 9 for the Lions. He was also the coach of the winning 1974 Lions in South Africa. He was the fifth of his countrymen inducted into the International HoF in 2003 and one of three Irishmen to join the IRB Hall in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "In the NFL, you have to be a quarterback to be able to wear #1. Which of these star quarterbacks wore #1 and had his number retired by his team?", "correct": "Warren Moon", "options": ["Joe Namath", "Steve Young", "John Elway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWarren Moon.\n\n\tAll four of these quarterbacks had their number retired and were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The only one to have worn the #1 shirt, though, was Warren Moon (played in the NFL from 1984 to 2000). Steve Young's #8 is on the wall at the 49ers' Candlestick Park. John Elway's #7 has pride of place at Mile High Stadium in Denver. Joe Namath's #12 has a permanent place at the Jets' home ground in East Rutherford NJ.\rThe first #1 retired by and NFL team belongs to Hall of Famer Ray Flaherty, who played for the New York Giants from 1928-35. For the record, four NFL teams (the Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins) do not retire jersey numbers. \n"}, {"text": "With a record seven World Championship titles to his name, there can be little argument about Michael Schumacher's claim to be #1 on the all-time list of Formula One drivers. For which team was he driving when he won his first world title?", "correct": "Benetton", "options": ["McLaren", "Ferrari", "Lotus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenetton.\n\n\tMichael Schumacher took part in five races in the 1991 season driving for Camel Benetton Ford. In the next two seasons, he completed a full 16-race season and finished third and fourth respectively in the Drivers Championship. The team name changed to Mild Seven Benetton Ford in 1994 and to Mild Seven Benetton Renault in 1995, but it was still essentially a Benetton team, and it was in these two years that he won the first two of his seven titles. \rSchumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996, but it was not until 2000 that he won again. Once he started winning, though, no one could stop him and he recorded five consecutive World Championship victories 2000-01-02-03-04 in Ferrari red. \rAfter retiring following the 2006 season, Schumacher returned in 2010 driving for the Mercedes GP Petronas team. \n"}, {"text": "One player who absolutely dominated his sport was 'His Airness' himself, Michael Jordan. He went to college in North Carolina and played for the Chicago Bulls, but where was the NBA's all-time #1 player born?", "correct": "Brooklyn NY", "options": ["Detroit MI", "Los Angeles CA", "Atlanta GA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooklyn NY.\n\n\tMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born in 1963 in Brooklyn NY. His family moved to Wilmington NC when he was still in diapers and that is where he went to High School. He then went on to college in his home state before the Chicago Bulls selected him with the THIRD (yes, 3rd) pick of the 1984 draft -- the Rockets took Hakeem Olajuwon and the Trailblazers picked Sam Bowie before Jordan went! \n"}]}
