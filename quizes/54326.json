{"id": "54326", "name": "'Somewhere In Time,' Part 2 Quiz | Somewhere in Time | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Somewhere in Time"], "questions": [{"text": "In the past, Elise McKenna is starring in a play at the Grand Hotel. Who wrote it?", "correct": "Bartlett Wells", "options": ["William Robinson", "Lillian Hellman", "Oscar Wilde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBartlett Wells.\n\n\tSeen clearly on the placard outside the theater. As far as I can tell, both the play ('Wisdom Of the Heart') and its author are entirely fictional constructs. \n"}, {"text": "Richard Collier finally finds Elise walking by the lake. She speaks first. What does she say to him?", "correct": "is it you & is it you?", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nis it you & is it you?.\n\n\tRichard is surprised to hear these words, but manages to answer with a 'Yes.' \n"}, {"text": "Richard and Elise's first meeting is interrupted by Elise's manager, William Robinson. What is Robinson's middle name?", "correct": "Fawcett", "options": ["Foster", "Falk", "Francis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFawcett.\n\n\tStated several times throughout the film. Christopher Plummer did an excellent job with the role, I felt. \n"}, {"text": "Elise has a young French woman as her personal assistant. What is her name?", "correct": "Marie", "options": ["Fiona", "Yvette", "Paige"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarie.\n\n\tWhen Richard first knocks on the door of Elise's hotel room, it is Marie who answers. We see her again later, after Elise's performance. (And for all those etymologists out there, 'Paige' is a French name meaning 'young attendant.' That was kind of a red herring, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "The night before Elise's performance, Robinson gives Elise some last-minute pointers. She apparently knows the last comment he offers by heart, as she says it along with him. What is it?", "correct": "'Excess within control.'", "options": ["'Always leave them wanting more.'", "'Don't let them catch you acting.'", "'Less is more.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Excess within control.'\n\n\tThey share a smile at her playfulness, and it's clear that despite Robinson's dark side, he truly does care very much for Elise. \n"}, {"text": "Richard and Elise spend the day together on scenic Mackinac Island. Which of the following things do they NOT do during their visit?", "correct": "Have their portrait painted", "options": ["Commandeer a horse-and-buggy", "Take a rowboat out on the lake", "They do all of these things"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHave their portrait painted.\n\n\tThey pause briefly to watch a man painting portraits, but never sit for one themselves.

What is her explanation?", "correct": "Robinson somehow knew that he was coming, and warned her", "options": ["She had dreamt of him the night before", "She had seen him in dreams all her life", "She is precognitive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobinson somehow knew that he was coming, and warned her.\n\n\tElise suggests, without actually stating it outright, that Robinson possesses some precognitive ability. Does he, or is he just an extremely good (or paranoid) guesser? We never really find out. \n"}, {"text": "Elise tells Richard that the theater company is set to leave the Grand Hotel immediately following their performance that night. Where are they off to?", "correct": "Denver, CO", "options": ["New York, NY", "Chicago, IL", "Philadelphia, PA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDenver, CO.\n\n\tA long way from the northernmost tip of Michigan, especially before the advent of commercial air travel. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Richard and Elise's electrifying first kiss take place?", "correct": "In her hotel room", "options": ["In his hotel room", "In the gazebo", "At the lighthouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn her hotel room.\n\n\tIn my opinion, the best kiss in the history of cinema. \n"}, {"text": "During Elise's first scene in 'Wisdom of the Heart,' her character laments the fact that she is engaged to a man she finds distasteful. The maid says, 'Surely there must be SOMETHING you like about him, Miss.' What does Elise say?", "correct": "'Yes. His absence.'", "options": ["'Yes. His wine cellar.'", "'Yes. His money.'", "'Yes.

Richard realizes that she is speaking directly to him, and is fairly bowled over when she says, 'I love you.' The audience thinks it's part of the play, and applauds wildly! \n"}, {"text": "Robinson asks Richard if he knows how long that Elise has been his protege. Richard, of course, knows exactly how long it's been, due to the extensive research he did before coming to the past. Since the date is June 28, 1912, how long has Robinson been Elise's manager?", "correct": "9.25 years", "options": ["7.25 years", "8.25 years", "10.25 years"], "explanation": "\n\n\n9.25 years\n\n\tRobinson: 'Do you have any idea how long she's been with me?'

Where is he?", "correct": "In a stable", "options": ["In his hotel room", "In a lighthouse", "In an abandoned cabin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a stable.\n\n\tHe is awakened by a horse eating the hay next to his head.

He realized his mistake immediately, and fished out all of the modern coins...or so he thought. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the present, Richard finds himself unable to muster the concentration to repeat his journey, and languishes away for the better part of a week. Arthur and a doctor finally find him on the verge of death, and call for an ambulance. What suite does Arthur say they're in?", "correct": "Suite 313", "options": ["Suite 420", "Suite 212", "Suite 416"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuite 313.\n\n\tRichard dies -- of starvation? Dehydration?

What is said?", "correct": "Neither of them says anything.", "options": ["Elise says, 'I've been waiting.'", "Richard says, 'Good evening, Miss McKenna.'", "Elise says, 'What took you so long?'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeither of them says anything.\n\n\tHe removes his hat and takes her hand.

Which of the following did Matheson NOT also write?", "correct": "He wrote all of these things", "options": ["Numerous episodes of the original 'Twilight Zone'", "The novel 'The Shrinking Man'", "The Steven Spielberg-directed TV-movie 'Duel'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe wrote all of these things.\n\n\tMatheson endures as one of the most respected names in science fiction, fantasy, and horror. He was one of Rod Serling's top writers on 'The Twilight Zone,' and his novel 'The Shrinking Man' was adapted into the 1950's classic film 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' He also wrote both the short story 'Duel' and the subsequent screenplay, which would become Steven Spielberg's first major project. \n"}]}
