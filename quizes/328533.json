{"id": "328533", "name": "\"Paper Mario\" (N64) - Chapter 1 Trivia Game  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Paper Mario", "Paper Mario (N64)"], "questions": [{"text": "Who instructs Mario to head east in search of the first Star Spirit?", "correct": "Merlon", "options": ["Twink", "Luigi", "Princess Peach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMerlon.\n\n\tHeading out from Shooting Star Summit, a Toad informs Mario that Merlon, the wizard living in Toad Town, would like to speak to him in his house (the one with the spinning roof).  When Mario knocks, no one answers, but a second knocking will bring Merlon out to talk.  Although Mario falls asleep during Merlon's story, the message is clear: save the Star Spirits. Merlon informs Mario that he must head east for the first of these.  Upon heading east, Mario's blocked by odd-looking Toads, but when Merlon investigates they discover that they're actually the Koopa Bros. in disguise.  A quick shock sends them off as Mario begins the first chapter of his journey. \n"}, {"text": "Visiting Koopa Village, what has stolen the Koopa shells?", "correct": "Fuzzies", "options": ["Goombas", "Bob-ombs", "Boos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuzzies.\n\n\tWhen Mario reaches his first stop heading east, Koopa Village, he discovers that this peaceful town has been overrun by Fuzzies who have decided to steal the shells of the citizens of town.  Using his jumping and hammering skills, Mario must fight all of these in battle to reclaim what is rightfully the Koopas'.  While many of the Fuzzies can easily be defeated within town so that the Koopas can go back to living their lives, the only one of major importance is in the green-shelled house in the east side of town.  Here, Mario will meet a new party member. \n"}, {"text": "After you reclaim his shell, who joins your party?", "correct": "Kooper", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKooper.\n\n\tBefore leaving Toad Town, Merlon predicted that Mario would need the assistance of a blue-shelled Koopa before he could save the next Star Spirit.  As it turns out, the blue-shelled Koopa is Kooper, who lives in the green house in Koopa Village.  When you decide to help him out the Fuzzy in his house will head to a clearing in behind the village where you'll need to play a quick mini-game (or even a battle) before you can reclaim the shell. Once you hand it back over, Kooper will offer his services to Mario as he wishes to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Professor Kolorado.  Pressing C-down with Kooper by your side will cause his shell to shoot forward and then, like a boomerang, return to you.\n"}, {"text": "How many Fortress Keys must Mario collect in the Koopa Fortress?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["None", "Seven", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tHeading east, Mario comes across the Koopa Fortress, a large, imposing structure in which the Koopa Bros. hide the first Star Spirit.  Here, Mario must make his way through the castle by shifting stairwells, razing walls, and fighting the enemies that call the fortress home (most specifically, evil Koopas).  Inside, the Koopa Bros. have a tendency to make things more difficult by blocking off routes and setting up traps for Mario to fall right into. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the pink Bob-omb who joins your party in the Koopa Bros. Fortress?", "correct": "Bombette", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBombette.\n\n\tWhen Mario falls into one of the traps laid out by the Koopa Bros., he and the other party member available will float down into the prison cell seen in the basement of the Fortress.  Here, Mario can meet Bombette who will offer to join Mario's party to help out.  Pressing C-down as Bombette will set her off in the direction Mario aims so that she can explode and destroy faulty walls or structures (or rocks, or whatever tens to explode).  While it could be expected that this would be fatal for little Bombette, she tends to reappear immediately after unharmed. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a colour of Koopa Bro. found in the game?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Red", "Black", "Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\tThe four Koopa Bros. are first seen in Princess Peach's Castle speaking to Bowser and Mario comes across them more than once before he arrives at their fortress.  Within their lair, Black Koopa will be waiting at the front door, Green will be hiding a key, Yellow will be setting a trap to drop Mario into the basement prison cell with the Bob-ombs, and Red will unleash Bullet Bills on the ramparts.  All four of them finally reunite for the final battle in the last chamber of the Fortress. \n"}, {"text": "During the battle with the Koopa Bros., they will hide in a large, wheeled version of which character?", "correct": "Bowser", "options": ["A Koopa", "Mario", "Shy Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBowser.\n\n\tIn order to spook Mario and demonstrate their 'awesome' powers, the four Koopa Bros. hide away in a large creature known simply as 'BOWSER???'.  While this constructed object doesn't do much damage, it's a quick distraction which can be disposed of easily.  Once this is destroyed, the four Koopa Bros. (each with 5HP) will gang up to fight in formation (causing 4HP of damage to Mario if successful) or, if you're lucky, you can get them on their backs where they're most vulnerable.  After the battle, the four will be trapped in their prison cell with the remains of their creation. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Star Spirit whom Mario saves at the end of this chapter?", "correct": "Eldstar", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEldstar.\n\n\tUpon defeating the Koopa Bros., Mario can obtain the card containing the spirit of Eldstar, the supposed leader of the Star Spirits.  Once Mario actually gets the chance to talk with Eldstar, he is granted with Star Power which is used to cast special attacks with the help of the Star Spirits.  Although Mario only starts with one bar, it's all he needs. If the bar is full, Mario can cast 'Refresh' to replenish 5HP and 5FP (and get rid of Poison effects).  If not, Mario also has the ability to Focus to raise the amount of Star Power in his possession in battle quicker than he normally would.  Every turn of battle will replenish a small amount of this Star Power. \n"}, {"text": "Princess Peach and Twink, meanwhile, will escape from Peach's room in the castle.  Where is the switch to escape?", "correct": "Behind a picture", "options": ["In the fireplace", "Under her bed", "Beside the door"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBehind a picture.\n\n\tPrincess Peach, still longing to be rescued, awaits Mario's return to her from her room.  She and Twink decide to make themselves busy and Peach escapes out the secret door in her room.  To access this, she must push a button on the wall (behind a picture) to extinguish her fireplace and she must travel down a corridor leading to an adjacent room.  Using this, the two of them come across some juicy information in Bowser's Diary regarding the second Star Spirit and Twink whisks himself away to notify Mario of its whereabouts. \n"}, {"text": "As of the completion of Chapter 1, which of these enemies has Mario not encountered?", "correct": "Lakitu", "options": ["Paratroopa", "Paragoomba", "Bullet Bill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLakitu.\n\n\tLakitus actually don't appear until a fair bit later in the game though they have a tendency to be quite strong in comparison to the enemies featured in the first chapter of the journey.  Paragoombas first appeared in the prologue as a companion to their Spiked and non-winged friends.  Likewise, Paratroopas have the same traits as their non-winged counterparts (save the fact that they can fly).  Bullet Bills are fought on the top of the Koopa Bros. Fortress and demonstrate a higher defense rating than most other creatures.  Luckily, their low health evens this out. \n"}]}
