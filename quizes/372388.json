{"id": "372388", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood [1] Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Fullmetal Alchemist"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Fullmetal Alchemist\" - In this first episode, Central City is attacked by which of the following?", "correct": "Freezing Alchemist", "options": ["Burning Alchemist", "Strongarm Alchemist", "Fullmetal Alchemist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreezing Alchemist.\n\n\tThe episode actually follows the assault on Central City as performed by 'Freezing Alchemist' Isaac McDougall who, originally, acted as a State Alchemist but has since gone rogue.  Edward and Alphonse Elric, some of the youngest members of the military guard, are called in (with others) to put a stop to McDougall before he destroys Central Command with his water powers. McDougall is ultimately killed by F\u00fchrer King Bradley in an alleyway, but not before his ice spreads throughout the city by way of carefully-placed transmutation circles.  The Elric Brothers hypothesize that McDougall must have had a Philosopher's Stone, something they've sought to return their bodies. \n"}, {"text": "\"The First Day\" - Edward and Alphonse originally attempted human transmutation to bring which of these people back form the dead?", "correct": "Their mother", "options": ["Their father", "Their brother", "Their friend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir mother.\n\n\tEdward and Al take the train to the city of Liore in search of the Philosopher's Stone, believing that its power is the key ingredient they need to get their bodies back.  Ten years earlier, when their mother passed away, they used alchemy in an attempt to bring her back but ended up paying a huge price for their labours-- Edward lost his arm and leg while Alphonse was sacrificed completely. After Edward found himself tumbling through the void, he was able to bring Al back, but only to the suit of armour that would act as his physical form.  When Edward was offered a spot in Central City's military, he took it up in an attempt to get closer to learning how to bring them back to normal. After passing his exams, he became the 'Fullmetal Alchemist', the youngest member of the militia under the command of Colonel Roy Mustang. \n"}, {"text": "\"City of Heresy\" - Edward and Alphonse head to the city of Liore to meet with Father Cornello and determine if he has a Philosopher's Stone in his presence.  Does the stone turn out to be real?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tReaching Liore, Ed and Al visit the local Letoist church to visit Father Cornello but, as it turns out, he's very aware of who the boys are and sets out to kill them before they can interfere with his attempt to amass an army of devout followers.  As it turns out, he's able to subvert the Law of Equivalent Exchange, so it's apparent that he has some sort of stone in his possession. After revealing Cornello's intent to the townspeople via a mass broadcast, Ed defeats him in an alchemical battle in the cathedral, destroying the ring possession the stone.  When it breaks, however, it proves to be a fake imbued with immense power. The brothers leave empty-handed, but they don't know they're being watched. \n"}, {"text": "\"An Alchemist's Anguish\" - Sewing-Life Alchemist Shou Tucker creates a chimera (by nefarious means) with what uncanny ability?", "correct": "Speech", "options": ["Fire-breathing", "Mirrored appearance", "Shapeshifting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeech.\n\n\tReturning to East City, Ed and Al decide to determine how Father Cornello could have had a chimera in his possession, and Colonel Mustang connects them with Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist, whose works on the subject lead all research on the topic.  In the meantime, however, a scarred man is traveling through the city killing State-certified Alchemists. As the Elrics get to know Tucker and his daughter, Nina, it comes as more of a shock when, in an attempt to retain his state-approval through his yearly evaluation, the man sacrifices his daughter and his dog's lives to create a new chimera capable of human speech. After the boys strike Tucker down and head off to tell the Colonel, both of the Tuckers are killed by the scarred assassin. \n"}, {"text": "\"Rain of Sorrows\" - The scarred assassin terrorizing and murdering State Alchemists is from what region?", "correct": "Ishval", "options": ["Dublith", "Resembool", "Liore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIshval.\n\n\tIn Liore, someone posing as Father Cornello rouses the crowds in front of the cathedral to riot, and this person turns out to be Envy who, along with Lust and Gluttony, are there to ensure that their plan remains in motion.\rBack in East City, the news of Tucker's murder reaches the Elrics but they're barred from visiting the crime scene.  While they head off they are, surprisingly, attacked by the scarred assassin and forced to flee through the streets with the man in hot pursuit.  The scarred man's powers prove exceedingly strong, destroying Edward's arm and most of Al's body but, fortunately, Colonel Mustang and his troops are able to step in and fight off the murderer.  They recognize the man as an escaped citizen of Ishval, a reach in the east destroyed by State Alchemists in the past, before he escapes into the sewers below. \n"}, {"text": "\"A Home With a Family Waiting\" - Where did Dr. Marcoh allegedly leave his research on the Philosopher's Stone?", "correct": "Central Library, First Branch", "options": ["The Fifth Laboratory", "Central Academy Archives", "Ishval"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentral Library, First Branch.\n\n\tEd and Al realize that the only way they'll be back in fighting shape is if they return to their hometown, Resembool, where Winry and Granny can perform the repairs on Ed's auto-mail arm and leg.  Colonel Mustang sends them off to do so, but has Major Armstrong accompany them.  En route, Armstrong spots a former colleague from the Ishval Civil War, Dr. Marcoh, and they head off in pursuit of the man (as he was presumed missing), a choice later considered shockingly coincidental because of his own ties to the Philosopher's Stone.  As they leave, Marcoh gives the location of his research in Central Library, First Branch.  He returns home to find Lust waiting.\rIn Resembool, the boys are welcomed and after three days, Winry and Granny put the finishing touches on Edward's robotics, allowing him to return his brother to full form.  They depart with the promise to return soon...and it's too late before Winry discovers she forgot a screw in the arm she was working on. \n"}, {"text": "\"Hidden Truths\" - Dr. Marcoh's research, as it turns out, is encrypted into which of these?", "correct": "Recipes", "options": ["Poetry", "Musical notation", "Visual artwork"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRecipes.\n\n\tHeading to Central to embark upon research at the Central Library, First Branch, the Elric Brothers arrive to find the building burnt to the ground.  Little do they know, it was destroyed by Lust and Gluttony, both of whom are in town covering any leads to the Philosopher's Stone and getting distracted by the Ishvalan assassin whom they find in the sewers.  They attack him, but end up causing enough damage to knock out a city block; no bodies of note are found.\rThe Elrics, meanwhile, find the information they need, but only by commissioning Sheska, a former librarian with a powerful memory, to rewrite what she recalls of the doctor's works.  She ends up compiling tons of recipe books which the boys realize is an encryption for the actual recipe of the stone.  This is how they come to discover that the item they've been searching for actually requires live, human ingredients in order to be created.  The research leads them and their bodyguards, Ross and Brosh, to determine that a mysterious laboratory, a decommissioned fifth lab in the city sitting next to the Central Prison, may actually hold the key.  The boys sneak out there at night, alone. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Fifth Laboratory\" - The secrets found within the lab are protected by the souls of which of these?", "correct": "Former death row inmates", "options": ["Ishvalan soldiers", "Former scientists", "Children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFormer death row inmates.\n\n\tThe Fifth Laboratory, as it turns out, is actually populated by guards, animated and bound into armour much like Alphonse to his own suit of armour, in an attempt to protect the secret behind the Philosopher's Stone.  Unfortunately, the souls bonded therein are those of former death row inmates from the prison next door, whose deaths fuelled the creation of the Philosopher's Stone.  Inside, Ed defeats the lead guardian and nearly gets his answers, but Lust arrives to prevent that from happening.  She and Envy destroy the building, leaving Ed with his brother outside, before disappearing.\rWhile Colonel Mustang discovers that he's likely to be moved to Central for a promotion, the Elrics end up in the hospital; Edward is relegated to bed since his arm (which he is not aware lacks a screw) is worse for wear, but Al lets thoughts brew in his mind...perhaps he's not real, but instead a creation of Ed's. \n"}, {"text": "\"Created Feelings\" - While in Central, Winry stays at the apartment of which other character?", "correct": "Lt. Colonel Hughes", "options": ["Edward Elric", "Major Armstrong", "2nd Lt. Maria Ross"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Colonel Hughes\n\n\tEd calls Winry and has her travel to East City to perform repairs on his arm and, guiltily, she takes the train to fix what she assumes is her own mistake.  Her arrival is met with approval not only by the boys, but by Lt. Colonel Hughes who practically forces her to stay with his family, even though it's his daughter's birthday.  Alphonse, however, is clearly down and it isn't until he expresses his true fears-- that perhaps Ed created his memories and that he was never his brother-- that the truth is let out.  The boys have a falling out before Winry forces Al to realize how absurd he's being.  They reconcile after a fight on the roof of the hospital.\rIn a slum outside of Central, the scarred assassin awakens, alive, having been found by other Ishvalan survivors.  Although he's still alive, he's terribly injured, and must rest before moving on. \n"}, {"text": "\"Separate Destinations\" - Who, after unearthing an important truth behind the goings-on around Central and East City, is silenced by Lust and Envy?", "correct": "Lt. Colonel Hughes", "options": ["F\u00fchrer King Bradley", "Colonel Mustang", "Winry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLt. Colonel Hughes\n\n\tF\u00fchrer King Bradley visits the Elric Brothers in the hospital both to wish them well and to sway them from their investigations as their suspicions alone make them vulnerable to attack; they, Major Armstrong, and Lt. Colonel Hughes are all present for this warning before he departs.  This spurs the boys to travel to Dublith to visit their former teacher, a trip Winry joins them on, mainly to visit Rush City, the Mecca for Auto-Mail enthusiasts.  Little do the others know, the boys plan to ask their teacher about the stone.\rBack in East City, Hughes continues to research the events of the last weeks, ultimately heading to the archives to connect the dots.  He discovers something serious, but before he can reach Colonel Mustang with the truth, he's attacked by both Lust and Envy and killed in a telephone booth outside the building.  During the funeral, Major Armstrong reveals to Mustang, cryptically, that something is amiss and being covered up.  Mustang vows that when his transfer to Central is complete, he will avenge his close friend and make waves. \n"}]}
