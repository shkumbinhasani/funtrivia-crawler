So great, in fact, that it was voted as the #34 greatest quote in the history of American film through a poll taken by the American Film Institute.  Imagine that, Lauren Bacall delivering one of Hollywood's most memorable lines in her very first film role.  The line is spoken to Steve (Harry Morgan's nickname) as part of a larger dialogue between the two characters who play a game of sexual cat and mouse throughout the film. \n"}, {"text": "Which reliable Hollywood supporting actor played the role of Eddie, alcoholic sidekick to the Humphrey Bogart character?", "correct": "Walter Brennan", "options": ["Ward Bond", "Glenn Ford", "Karl Malden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter Brennan.\n\n\tWow, Walter Brennan seemed to show up in just about every movie during the 1930s, 40s and 50s (he appeared in 222 films altogether during his career).
