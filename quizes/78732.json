{"id": "78732", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Tuttle' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Where do Trapper and Hawkeye get the name Tuttle?", "correct": "Hawkeye's childhood imaginary friend", "options": ["They never clearly say", "Trapper's childhood imaginary friend", "A combination of Hawkeye's and Trapper's childhood imaginary friend's names"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye's childhood imaginary friend.\n\n\tTuttle was Hawkeye's imaginary childhood friend, the one who took the blame for all of his little mishaps. If he spilled his milk, broke a vase or played hookie from class, he could conveniently blame Tuttle! \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Radar's childhood imaginary friend?", "correct": "Shirley", "options": ["Sally", "Sherman", "Siebert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShirley.\n\n\tStrangely, Radar's imaginary friend was female (is that strange?) and according to Radar 'looked just like me, only with tiny little breasts'. I'm surprised they got that line by the network censors! \n"}, {"text": "What was Tuttle's full name?", "correct": "Jonathan S. Tuttle", "options": ["Jack Q. Tuttle", "Robert Tuttle", "Phil M. Tuttle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan S. Tuttle\n\n\tYou can hear the full name being enunciated over the intercom system pretty early on in the show. According to Frank, however, Tuttle goes by Johnny to his 'close friends'. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper and Hawkeye go through great pains in creating a vivid description of Tuttle's personal background, when forging a file for this imaginary pal. Of what religion do they decide to make Tuttle a practitioner?", "correct": "Druid, Reformed", "options": ["Zoroastrian, Latter Day", "Animist, Born Again", "Pagan, Orthodox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDruid, Reformed.\n\n\tSome of his other stats? Hawkeye: 'Mother?' Trapper: 'Yes.' Hawkeye: 'Father?' Trapper: 'One!' Their names...Harry and Frieda. Tuttle was born in 1924, a good year, in Battle Creek, Michigan. He got his medical degree at Berlin Polytechnic (or, as Hawkeye and later Margaret so eloquently put it, Berlinisches Politeknikum)...prompting Frank to accuse Tuttle (one of his best pals!) of being a Nazi. \n"}, {"text": "In order to tantalize Hot Lips, what color do Hawkeye and Trapper make Tuttle's eyes and hair?", "correct": "hazel and auburn", "options": ["bronze and mahogany", "green and copper blonde", "blue and chestnut"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhazel and auburn.\n\n\tHis full physical stats, according to Hawkeye, 'Height - 6' 4', weight - 195 pounds, hair - auburn, eyes - hazel.' 'Hawkeye' Trapper gently responds, 'I think I'm in love.' Later on...Margaret also falls in love, just as she's supposed to! \n"}, {"text": "Which oft mentioned character in the series makes his one and only appearance on this show?", "correct": "Sparky & sparkie", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSparky & sparkie.\n\n\tHe's mentioned as Sparky often enough, but calls himself Sergeant Pryor when corresponding with Margaret.

Finally, after his unfortunate death, Sister Theresa's orphanage is named Tuttle's sole beneficiary for his GI insurance. \n"}, {"text": "Which character says, 'Our country can use all the Tuttles we can get.'?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Margaret", "Henry", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tFrank says this to Margaret as they wait at attention during Tuttle's award ceremony. Perhaps an even better line comes a bit later when Henry asks Hawkeye to deliver a eulogy for Tuttle. Henry claims that Hawkeye knew Tuttle best, drawing Frank's ire and this comment to Margaret 'that's not true, I knew him best!' \n"}, {"text": "How does Tuttle die?", "correct": "Falls from a helicopter", "options": ["Crushed by a water buffalo", "Slips in the shower", "Attacked by mountain lions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalls from a helicopter.\n\n\tTuttle made a chopper flight to help treat some wounded, but as Hawkeye puts it, 'He jumped with his plasma, his bag, everything an army doctor needs, except his parachute.' All that was left of Tuttle? His dog tags... \n"}, {"text": "Who says, 'In fact you might say that all of us together made up Tuttle.'?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": ["Radar", "Trapper", "Henry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tThis is from his speech at the end of the show. Also from the speech, 'We salute you Captain Tuttle, humanitarian and healer. Good luck doctor, in that great big waiting room in the sky!' Henry is so inspired following this speech he states, 'He was the best damned OD (officer of the day) we ever had.' Lots of silly lines from that episode....hope you enjoyed the quiz! \n"}]}
