When they check Lana's room, they find notes in her pillowcase; she still plans on writing the story and exposing Jude and the asylum for what it is.  When Sister Jude takes the notes, Lana says she'll commit it to her memory.\rSister Jude proceeds to Dr. Arden's office with a proposition.  She feels that Lana's memories are what are forcing her to oppose treatment, so she asks Dr. Arden to perform electroshock therapy.  Dr. Arden is (ahem) shocked by Sister Jude's claim that electroshock therapy can be just another tool to rid inmates of sin.\rWhen Dr. Arden and his assistants strap Lana into her stretcher, he has Sister Jude hold one of the instruments against Lana's head and he turns the dial. \n"}, {"text": "What does Dr. Arden give to Sister Mary Eunice as a gift for the work she's been doing for him?", "correct": "Candy apple", "options": ["Brooch", "Chocolate bar", "Hair brush"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandy apple.\n\n\tKit heads to the common room to speak with a court-appointed psychologist by the name of Dr. Oliver Thredson.  While he gives benefit of the doubt to Kit in the beginning, he wraps up his report on the subject with the decision that he's manipulative and, foremost, suffering from acute clinical insanity.  Kit ends up remembering that when 'they' took Alma, she was still alive.\rIn the forest, Sister Mary Eunice is approached by Dr. Arden while she carries a tattered basket away from where she left it.  She says that whatever's out in the forest seems to be getting angrier.  As thanks, Dr. Arden brings her a gift, a candy apple, and asks her to take a bite (\"life is too short for regrets\").  Although she originally believes that sweets lead to sin, she decides to take a bite.  Shelly watches them return from the woods from one of the asylum windows. \n"}, {"text": "A family brings their boy to the asylum in this episode.  Which of these did he kill before they admitted him?", "correct": "A cow", "options": ["His sister", "A cat", "Three women"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cow.\n\n\tIn the common room, Lana struggles to keep focus.  The electroshock therapy is wreaking havoc on her memory and perception so she writes her thoughts on a piece of paper to remember her escape route.  Behind her, Grace and Kit discuss escape.  Kit knows he needs to leave before the reports against him are filed but Grace says it's not possible.\rDr. Thredson speaks with Sister Jude and says that he hasn't made a determination on Kit but, more importantly, he's appalled by the conditions of the institution.  Sister Jude says his job is to write a recommendation based on one patient and that he should let her do her job.\rWhen Sister Jude heads upstairs to speak with a family regarding their son, Dr. Thredson gets himself involved (with the parents' permission).  It seems that their son is hearing voices and acting out; Sister Jude says 'good boys gone bad' is her expertise, but it's worse than that.  The other day, they caught him in the barn having slaughtered their best Guernsey with his bare hands and eaten its heart.  The feel as though he's been possessed.  When they visit the boy in his room in the asylum, Sister Jude warns the doctor that he should not wear out his welcome so soon.  Dr. Thredson tries to speak to the boy, but they come face-to-face with a nightmare-- the boy starts speaking in a guttural voice in a language they can't understand.

Grace says she can help, but they need to bring Kit; Lana promptly refuses to let Kit along as she believes he's a murderer.\rDown in the kitchen, Shelley finds Dr. Arden and tries to seduce him.  Shelley says that all she wants to do is be out in the sun for fifteen minutes and she'll do anything to get it.  When Dr. Arden insults her, she tells her life story.  When her mother disowned her for what she was doing to herself as a youth, she fled from home and fell in love with a bass player.  Her husband would sleep around while she stayed home until one day, during Fleet Week, she slept with two men.  Her husband drove her to the asylum and they locked her up, believing she was a sex addict in need of curing.  Dr. Arden says that she makes him sick and refuses her any sunlight. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Thredson refuses to be part of the exorcism.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAs night falls, a car pulls up to the asylum and an exorcist arrives.  Inside, Dr. Thredson speaks with the Monsignor about the patient and the upcoming procedure.  Thredson questions how an exorcism would help and the Monsignor says that while times have changed, the nature of evil has not.  In fact, he expects Thredson to assist in the procedure-- a licensed physician must be present.  The exorcist is thrilled to be working with a non-believer amongst them.\rIn the common room, Lana tries to write down the escape route but Grace tries to get the info from her.

She acts a bit vulgar but when he insists on either talking proper or not at all, she tries to appeal to him.  He's disappointed that she doesn't drink or kiss and when she tries to dance for him, he gets angry.  When he makes her sit down he suggests that she should be more careful what with a killer having been on the loose.\rAt the asylum, Dr. Thredsen is shocked to find his mother's voice coming from the mouth of the possessed victim.

Before she was a nun, she used to frequent a specific bar and get too drunk to care about who she was sleeping with. One night, driving home drunk, she accidentally hit a young girl in a blue jacket, killing her on impact.  When the boy accuses her of being a murderer, she gets furious-- the Monsignor needs to restrain her and pull her from the room.

Now's their chance-- they make a run for it.  When they reach the door, Kit shows up to join them.  Lana refuses to let Kit join them, but Grace believes that Kit is innocent so she takes him to leave.

Frightened, she bites him in the arm and kicks him to the ground before fleeing the house.\rThe next day, Dr. Arden finds Sister Mary Eunice in the infirmary and covers her to protect her modesty.

It's clear, when he leaves, that something is amiss with the once timid sister.\rSister Jude brings Lana into her office and says that she surprised her; she though Lana was a corrupt opportunist.  Lana is given something special for calling the orderlies; when she opens the door, Grace and Kit are ushered in.  Sister Jude asks Lana to pick out a cane and moves to hit Grace, but Kit takes the blame for everything.  Instead of splitting the canings out twenty apiece, Sister Jude allows Kit to take all forty. \n"}]}
