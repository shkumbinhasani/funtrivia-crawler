{"id": "295439", "name": "\"Lego Indiana Jones\" - Barnett College Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games L-P", "Lego Games"], "questions": [{"text": "What room must you enter if you want to access the key to open the bonus levels?", "correct": "Indy's Office", "options": ["Artifact Room", "Art Room", "Courtyard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndy's Office.\n\n\tIn order to get to the bonus levels, several things must be accomplished.  To begin, you must have a certain number of artifacts to open each one.  The final will not open until you have 100% of the artifacts completed, and NOT by buying the pieces.  When you have all the artifacts, you can place a blue crystal in a platform to get studs and open a level. Go to Indy's Office, and make sure you have several different characters available.  You will need most of the different kinds of people, including a shovel, a shorty, and a high jumper.  After you collect all the boxes, assemble them to in the middle of the room, smash what you make, pick up the key, and take it back to the Artifact Room. Once you have done this, the platforms will lower and you can access the bonus levels. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not a bonus level you can play in the game?", "correct": "Lego City", "options": ["Young Indy", "Ancient City", "Warehouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLego City.\n\n\t\"Lego City\" does not appear in this game.  The first bonus level is \"Young Indy.\"  In this level, you go back in time, just like in the third movie, and try to steal a cross from the bad men.  This is where we learn how Indy gets the scar on his chin, his whip, and his hat.  \"Ancient City\" is very similar to \"Lego City.\"  You must still get 1,000,000 studs as fast as you can, but it is a much different city than the \"Lego City\" you can find in \"Lego Star Wars.\"  The final bonus is the warehouse. Here, you must gather 712,020 studs, and there are much more than this in the room.  To get the fastest time possible, you can either collect everthing possible and make roads everywhere, but the easier way is to get a gun or a blaster and shoot the target at the far right. You will get an infinite amount of studs, and you will get your score in no time. \n"}, {"text": "Where will you land if you jump off the railing in the Artifact Room?", "correct": "Courtyard", "options": ["Indy's Office", "You can't do this", "Main Hall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCourtyard.\n\n\tIf you jump off the rails in the Artifact Room, you will drop down to the Courtyard.  The courtyard is a long path with plants and benches that can be destroyed.  It leads to the Art Room. \n"}, {"text": "What can you do in the Art Room?", "correct": "Create your own characters", "options": ["Watch unlocked videos", "Buy things", "Enter cheats"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreate your own characters.\n\n\tIn the Art Room there are two spots with people on them.  These are your customizable characters.  If it is single player, you can switch back and forth between them and create two different characters.  If it is two players, you each have your own character to create. \n"}, {"text": "Where can you buy characters to play?", "correct": "Library", "options": ["Classroom", "Art Room", "Indy's Office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLibrary.\n\n\tIn the library, you can purchase all sorts of characters.  Any character you have defeated, or that you did not receive while playing the level, you can purchase here.  You can also gets loads of studs by destroying the tables, chairs, and bookshelves. \n"}, {"text": "After collecting five guest characters, who is available to buy?", "correct": "Han Solo", "options": ["Lion", "Indiana Jones Ghost", "Young Henry Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHan Solo.\n\n\tYou can purchase Han Solo for 100,000 studs if you have found the other five Star Wars characters hidden throughout the levels.  You can find C3PO, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and R2-D2.  They are all found in areas that look like levels of Star Wars.  For instance, Luke is trapped in the snow where the yeti hangs him from the wall, and Leia is found in the room she is inprisoned in on the Death Star. Both Han Solo and Indiana Jones are played by Harrison Ford.  You can never purchase an Indiana Jones ghost, Henry Jones when he was younger, or the lion you fight in \"Young Indy.\" \n"}, {"text": "Other than the students that walk the halls of Barnett College, there is only one other character you purchase you cannot play in the college.  Who is this?", "correct": "Monkey", "options": ["Henry Jones", "Young Indy", "Elsa (Officer)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonkey.\n\n\tOnce you have purchased the monkey man, the monkey wanders the halls.  However, you cannot play the monkey unless you are playing the monkey man in free play.  As the monkey man, you can get the monkey to reach things you couldn't normally reach. \n"}, {"text": "Where can you input cheat codes you find?", "correct": "Classroom", "options": ["Theatre", "Courtyard", "Library"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClassroom.\n\n\tBoth the classroom and the theatre have chalkboards.  The classroom chalkboard is where you input cheats, while the theatre board is just for show.  However, even if you do not have any cheats to enter, every player should have one cheat.  There is always a cheat, that varies from player to player, in the theatre, clearly written on the chalkboard. If you want to make the game easier, I recommend the cheats.  If you want more of a challenge, do not use them.  Unlike \"Lego Star Wars,\" the cheats actually BUY the characters and items for you, not just make them available to buy, so you don't have to work very hard to get anything. \n"}, {"text": "How are you able to access levels from the Barnett College?", "correct": "Maps on the wall", "options": ["Rooms like the ones in \"Lego Star Wars\"", "You choose them in the Artifact Room", "Pause and pick your level"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaps on the wall.\n\n\tUnlike \"Lego Star Wars,\" you access the levels by looking at maps on the wall.  Each map represents a different movie.  The first one is \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" the second is \"The Temple of Doom,\" and the third one is \"The Last Crusade.\"  To choose your level when looking at the map, you move the magnifying glass around until you enlarge the level you would like to play. \n"}, {"text": "Finally, what happens when you have completed the game?", "correct": "Stud Shower", "options": ["Stud Stream", "Stud Fountain", "Stud River"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStud Shower.\n\n\tWhen you have completed the game 100%, you get never-ending studs.  They constantly fall from the ceiling/sky of every room in the college.  You can rack up major studs if you have your multipliers on.  You can't get 100% unless you have collected EVERYTHING in EVERY level, bought EVERY character, including Han Solo, and bought every thing in the mail room possible. \n"}]}
