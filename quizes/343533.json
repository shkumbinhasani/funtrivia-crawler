{"id": "343533", "name": "\"Mash Off\" Trivia Game | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "In the beginning of this episode, Puck sings \"Hot For Teacher\".  Who does he direct his song towards?", "correct": "Ms. Corcoran", "options": ["Mr. Schuester", "Sue", "Ms. Holliday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMs. Corcoran\n\n\tPuck starts to realize the depth of his feelings for Shelby Corcoran and makes every attempt to get her to notice him.  He longs for fourth period where Shelby is covering his geometry class but he ends up spending most of his time daydreaming anyways.  His latest vision is of the class rambunctiously breaking loose to perform Van Halen's \"Hot For Teacher\" while Ms. Corcoran walks along a stage. The number progresses to the choir room where Puck, Blaine, Mike, and Finn all perform the song for New Directions.  Will loves the song-- especially the fact that they didn't even need an assignment to put it together. Rachel thinks it's energetic, but a little inappropriate and Will says it really depends on Puck's motivation.  Puck says he just really likes Van Halen and that seems to be enough. \n"}, {"text": "Sue's smear campaign against Burt suggests that he received a heart from which of these?", "correct": "Baboon", "options": ["Pig", "Cow", "Orphan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaboon.\n\n\tSue's smear campaign against Burt Hummel is launched and much of it focuses on the danger of baboons (and, by connection, Burt, who she believes may have a baboon heart).  Will is very much angered by this and Emma has to calm him down.  Kurt visits Sue's office to criticize her campaign approach and she says that the point of politics is to play dirty. She also says that he should radically reconsider his own campaign for senior class president since Brittany is telling lies and connecting with voters.  Sue says that she was able to attain her popularity through poop-slinging, and he should do the same by finding a cause to staunchly support. He says he'll find a cause but he'll be honest with the voters. \n"}, {"text": "Will discovers that his kids will be facing off against the Trouble Tones at Sectionals along with what other team?", "correct": "The Unitards", "options": ["Vocal Adrenaline", "The Jane Adams Girls", "The Dalton Academy Warblers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Unitards.\n\n\tIn the teacher's lounge, Shelby decides to speak to Will about Sectionals since they both received their letters and discovered that they would be going head-to-head (along with a third group called the Unitards).  Will fears that the competition will make everyone more agitated and feels disappointed that he won't be able to do any mash-ups as usual at this time of year.  They decide, however, that mash-ups might still be in the cards.\rBringing both glee clubs to the auditorium (where they promptly begin to argue), Shelby and Will begin to duet to a new mash-up.  She sings Lady Gaga's \"You and I\" while be sings Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle's \"You and I\".  The assignment this week is a friendly competition involving mash-ups; it's the first annual McKinley High Mash-Off and each club will perform their mash-up head-to-head. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests a Hall and Oates mash-up for New Directions' performance?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Brittany", "Blaine", "Rory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tAfter class, Puck admits his love for Shelby and she says that while he's a sweet guy, she can't be with a student; she doesn't feel comfortable with it and she would get fired if she decided to go through with it.  Puck claims that they're the perfect mash-up since they don't sound like they could go together, but would make an excellent couple.  He claims that she feels the same way about him before leaving.\rWill tells the kids that they have their work cut out for them and that they need to pick an excellent mash-up to go against the girls in the Trouble Tones.  The kids all have their ideas, but Finn is the one to suggest Hall and Oates because unlike the other ideas, they stayed together over the long-haul and never broke up.  He also recommends that they let their newest member, Rory, take a more prominent role. \n"}, {"text": "Shelby refuses to sign a letter of recommendation for Rachel.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tQuinn hassles Puck about making sure they can get social services to catch Shelby committing a horrible act against Beth, that way they can reclaim the child.  Puck seems worried about this plan and Quinn decides to try and join the Trouble Tones to be closer to her daughter.  Shelby says she'll need to think about that idea.\rIn the halls, Finn talks to Rory about Santana's trash talking and suggest that they'll need to find a way to one-up her.  When she walks by, both of them try to insult her but she says that their attempts are futile.  Finn decides to challenge her and her Trouble Tones to a game of dodgeball to prove who's best.\rRachel speaks to Shelby in the auditorium about signing a letter of recommendation for NYADA.  Shelby gladly agrees and says that she'll be cheering her on.  Looking over her resume, Shelby says that all the big-ticket items on her list will do well for her.  Anyone who's missing a single one is likely not to be accepted. \n"}, {"text": "Which team wins the dodgeball game held in the gym?", "correct": "The Trouble Tones", "options": ["New Directions", "The teachers", "None of these; the game is broken up too early"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Trouble Tones.\n\n\tBefore the dodgeball game begins, Rachel tries to speak to Kurt about NYADA applications but she discovers that he's still angry with her after her decision to run against him for senior class president.  Soon enough, the dodgeball game begins with the kids taking to their sides and beginning the event.  While New Directions sings Pat Benetar's \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\", the Trouble Tones mash it up with Blondie's \"One Way or Another\".\rIn the Trouble Tones' choir room, Mercedes suggests that they use Adele for their mash-up since they would be playing with their strengths; Shelby agrees.  Santana, however, is frustrated with the idea that Mercedes is making herself queen of the club, but they all decide to vote Mercedes the president of the Trouble Tones anyways.  They tell Santana she needs to play fair with New Directions and she concedes. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Finn reveal the secret about Santana's sexuality?", "correct": "In the school hallways", "options": ["On the internet", "In the choir room", "At Breadstix"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the school hallways.\n\n\tSantana decides to 'apologize' to Finn for the nasty things she's said but the apology turns out to be even more veiled insults.  When she walks away, Finn simply tells Santana, out loud, that perhaps she shouldn't be such a coward and that she should come out of the closet because everyone knows and no one cares.\rSue's next campaign video gets Will and Burt fired up, particularly because it tries to tell viewers that Burt is married to a donkey.  Sue's new catchphrase?  \"It's not personal.\"\rAt Shelby's, Puck watches the baby while Shelby puts together a new crib.  He decides to come clean about what Quinn did, specifically hiding unsafe items in Shelby's apartment, and the fact that she did it to get Beth back.  He doesn't want anything bad to happen though because Beth deserves the best. \n"}, {"text": "To decide who performs first for the Mash Off, what is done?", "correct": "A game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'", "options": ["A number is drawn", "A coin is flipped", "Ladies go first"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'.\n\n\tThe first day of the Mash Off is set into motion and Santana and Finn play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' to determine who goes first-- it's New Directions.  Hitting the stage (with some of the guys in mustaches and afros a la Hall & Oates), their mash-up consists of \"I Can't Go For That\" and \"You Make My Dreams Come True\".  The performance is energetic but the audience seems a bit occupied; Santana doesn't seem to care for the song choices while Shelby is visibly distressed about Quinn.\rIn the auditorium, the school's senior class presidential debate is held.  Becky informs Sue that her new ad, reflecting an untruth about Burt sexually molesting cars in his auto shop, has her a popular candidate.  Principal Figgins congratulates the meager crowd on a good turnout and the debate begins. \n"}, {"text": "During Brittany's campaign speech, she vows to ban which of the following from McKinley High?", "correct": "Tornadoes", "options": ["Headbands", "Hockey sticks", "Tater tots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTornadoes.\n\n\tThe debate begins with one of the hockey players at McKinley though it's clear that he has minimal support.  Brittany is next to present her speech; she says she'll ban tornadoes from McKinley and go topless on Tuesdays, much to the crowd's pleasure.  Kurt is next to speak and he speaks seriously about bullying and smear campaigns. He pledges to ban dodgeball.  When Rachel stands up she resigns from the race for presidency and tells everyone to vote for Kurt; he's the only one to have a positive campaign about relevant issues.  Rachel later tells Kurt that she dropped out to give him the boost on the NYADA application and so that they could be friends again (and so that she could be his campaign slave). \n"}, {"text": "Does Sue's last campaign video purposely out Santana's sexuality?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tQuinn stops over at Shelby's apartment and asks about the Trouble Tones spot but Shelby plays it straight with her.  She's not allowed to join, she knows about the social services scheme, and she's not comfortable with her around Beth.  Quinn leaves angry.\rSantana is called to Sue's office and she's told some horrible news.  One of Sue's opponents ended up targeting her.  Finn's revelation of Santana's sexuality was leaked by a student and a new ad (opposing Sue) was sent out claiming that she supports same-sex couples.  Santana's secret would be outed and she hasn't even told her family.\rThe Trouble Tones perform their mash-up of Adele's \"Rumour Has It\" and \"Someone Like You\" with Mercedes and Santana on lead vocals.  During the end of the number, Finn whispers praise about the performance to Rachel-- Santana doesn't like this.  She claims he's spreading lies about her and before he can explain the truth, she slaps him in the face. \n"}]}
