Quiz | Food & Drink | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink", "Cheeses and Dairy Products"], "questions": [{"text": "Casu marzu is a Sardinian delicacy, whose fermentation is provided by live action. What organisms are responsible for giving this cheese its especial flavor and aroma?", "correct": "Maggots", "options": ["Ants", "Fungi", "Sardines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggots.\n\n\tYes, the Sardinians take a fine young pecorino, and deliberately allow it to become infested with the larvae of the cheese fly. Their secretions produce a liquid referred to as \"lagrima\"- tears. I'd cry too! \n"}, {"text": "Certain bodily protections are advised for the person who dares to eat casu marzu. What are they?", "correct": "Eye protection", "options": ["A gas mask", "A full-body protective suit", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEye protection.\n\n\tThe maggots, upon invasion of their cheesy home, begin jumping into the air (one of the names of this cheese translates to \"jumping cheese.) Catapulting up to six inches, they often land in the eyes of cheese consumers. \n"}, {"text": "Those who eat casu marzu must suffer the consequences! What is one possible side-effect of consuming this delicacy? ", "correct": "Ulcerated intestines", "options": ["Tetanus", "Brain infection", "Fungal infection of the tongue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUlcerated intestines.\n\n\tThe maggots are even less happy about being eaten. Undeterred by a little stomach acid, they find themselves in the intestines and, determined to escape, burrow into the intestinal walls, causing ulcers, nausea and bleeding.\r This cheese is traditionally eaten accompanied by strong red wine- whether to kill the maggots or to numb the senses enough for such foolish behavior I do not know. \n"}, {"text": "Not to be outdone by the Sardinians, the German residents of W\u00fcrchwitz produce their own cheese so monumentally disgusting that they have built a monument to it! What imparts the special tang to their Milbenk\u00e4se?", "correct": "Cheese mite excrement", "options": ["Fermented sausage", "Ground fish scales", "Goat dung"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheese mite excrement.\n\n\tMilbenk\u00e4se is produced by placing a mild white cheese seasoned with salt and caraway into a container filled with cheese mites, which have been lovingly fattened with rye flour. The happy mites excrete prodigiously, and the cheese is kept in confinement until its rind has achieved a lovely shade of brown or black. \r The monument is a giant statue of a cheese mite. I doubt it draws many tourists. \n"}, {"text": "One type of Reblochon is a French cheese which is prized for its unusual aroma. What substance provides its unique bouquet?", "correct": "Fresh cow manure", "options": ["Rotted grapes", "Dried fish", "Lark's vomit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFresh cow manure.\n\n\tThe cheese is aged on racks a few feet away from the dairy's manure pile. While the inside stays soft and creamy, the outside gets a bit smelly...or in the words of one gourmet, \"redolent of the byre.\" \n"}, {"text": "Gamalost is a cheese that has been made in Norway for over 1000 years and is known for its overpowering odor. Traditionally, it was made by a Norse maiden who would wrap it in reeds, put it in a box, and store it under her bed for months, lovingly removing it every day to rub it down by hand and spread the mold around. Jokingly, it is said to be made by putting cheese in a sock and burying it in a pile of manure. By what other appellation is this cheese known?", "correct": "Viking Viagra", "options": ["Noisome Norse", "Norwegian good", "Oslo stinko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nViking Viagra.\n\n\tNowadays it is made in factories and is less pungent, although it still packs a powerful wallop (purchasers are advised to keep it frozen to prevent excess funkiness.)\r Why this stuff is claimed to be an aphrodisiac is anyone's guess. \n"}, {"text": "The Teddington Cheese, a British cheesemonger that sells cheeses from around the world, awards only a few the euphemistic label \"pungent.\" The true meaning of this epithet is indicated by the fact that the icon for these varieties is a man in a gas mask. What cheese is ranked by Teddington as the strongest of their wares?", "correct": "Vieux Lille", "options": ["Stilton", "Limburger", "Yarg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVieux Lille.\n\n\tAs Teddington's states (http://www.teddingtoncheese.co.uk/acatalog/de433.htm)\"If you asked us which is the strongest cheese in the shop, Vieux Lille would be a good contender for the super-heavyweight crown. With a pungent odour and strong salty flavour, this cheese is certainly not for the faint-hearted. The alternate names of 'Puant de Lille' and 'Puant Mac\u00e9r\u00e9' are a little more descriptive, the latter being literally translated as 'stinking pickle'.\" \n"}, {"text": "Stinking Bishop, surprisingly enough, is not named for its stink....although everyone agrees it *does* stink- er, it possesses an assertive bouquet. Why is this cheese called \"Stinking Bishop\"?", "correct": "It's named after a pear", "options": ["It's named after an unliked member of the clergy", "It's named after a chess piece that it resembles in shape", "It's named after the nickname of the man who makes it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's named after a pear.\n\n\tStinking Bishop is redolent of damp, moldy socks. It gets this strong odor from repeated baths in perry, a wine made with pears, which encourages the growth of a certain smelly bacterium. The perry is made from a pear called Stinking Bishop, which is named after an ill-tempered man of the cloth who first bred it.\r This cheese was featured in the movie \"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit,\" which cased demand to skyrocket so high that the only producer of the cheese, Gloucestershire farmer Charles Martell, was pressured to sell his business. He refused. \n"}, {"text": "Believe it or not, there is smelly cheese science. Some esteemed professors got together at Cranfield University in England and determined, through the use of both an \"electronic nose\" and human odor testers, which cheese was the rankest of them all. Vieux Boulogne from France was the worst offender. What gives it its penetrating reek? ", "correct": "Repeated washes in beer", "options": ["Storage in used manure sacks", "Burying in fungus-infested ground", "Passing through the intestinal tract of a monkey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRepeated washes in beer.\n\n\tThe beer combines with the cheese enzymes to produce an overpowering odor as it ferments. The study was sponsored by a French cheese organization which wants to encourage people to eat more smelly cheeses. The head of this organization, Sally Clark, stated in a press release \"France has a huge selection of weird and wonderful whiffy cheeses and their smell often disguises a delicate, subtle flavour that has to be tried to be believed.\"\r I'll pass, thank you. \n"}, {"text": "Disgusting cheeses are not just a health hazard, they are a public nuisance. If you pick up some aromatic French Epoisses in Paris, what hazard may you encounter?", "correct": "You can't ride public transportation", "options": ["You may be evicted from your apartment", "You have given legal cause for divorce", "All of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou can't ride public transportation.\n\n\tAccording to many sources, Epoisses was banned, at least in the past, from public transportation; its smell being so offensive as to nauseate even the smelly-cheese-loving French. There is some dispute as to whether the ban still exists. \n"}]}
