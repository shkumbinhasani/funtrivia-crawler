'Night Time' spawned a total of three singles for the band, the biggest hit single of their career, 'Love Like Blood' which reached number 16 in the UK singles chart, 'Eighties' and 'Kings and Queens' which both reached positions in the British Top 75.

The album was originally released in 1970 but was paid little attention, however, after the commercial success of the album 'Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars', on its re-release in November 1972 it sold well and attracted much critical acclaim. This album has been described as the point at which the 'glam-rock' movement started and has been cited as an influence by a number of later artists such as Gary Numan, The Cure and John Foxx, one of the original electronic rock pioneers with British band Ultravox. The title track has been covered by bands and artists such as Nirvana and Scottish singer Lulu, who had some considerable success with the song as a single in 1974.  \n"}, {"text": "My own personal favourite rock band, and from where I have taken my funtrivia username, their 1974 album 'Axe Victim' features the tracks 'Night Creatures' and 'Darkness (L'Immoraliste)'...

The band cut their first recordings during April 1973 and was signed to EMI Harvest records on the 22nd of February 1974.  Their first album, 'Axe Victim', was recorded in less than six weeks and after the release of this album, the band never looked back.  The album's distinctive artwork featuring a skull forming the body of an electro-acoustic guitar; Nelson has used the Gibson ES335 throughout his career, has been modified and copied on a number of occasions and a real guitar in this form was made for Brian May of Queen. From a personal viewpoint, if you are a lover of 1970s guitar driven rock music, then you might do well to give Be-Bop Deluxe a listen... I don't think you'll be disappointed! \n"}, {"text": "'Organisation', 'Architecture and Morality' and 'Dazzle Ships'; three albums from which Merseyside based electro-pop band of the 1980s who can claim total sales of over 40 million records?", "correct": "Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark", "options": ["A Flock of Seagulls", "Depeche Mode", "Kraftwerk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.\n\n\tOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, better known by the initials OMD, were one of the more serious electronic bands that found success throughout the 1980s.
