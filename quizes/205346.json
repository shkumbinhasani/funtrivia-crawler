{"id": "205346", "name": "Bosses of \"Super Mario World\" Quiz | Mario Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario World (SNES)"], "questions": [{"text": "My first question is appropriately a question about the first boss.  What is the first boss' name?", "correct": "Iggy & Iggy Koopa", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nIggy & Iggy Koopa.\n\n\tIggy Koopa waits in his castle in the northeast corner of Yoshi's Island.  It's the first time in the game that you can encounter lava and ceiling stompers.  An easy way to defeat Iggy is by using a fire flower to shoot him off his teetering island.  After a few shots, he'll fall off before he can hit you. \n"}, {"text": "Which boss can be fought on Chocolate Island?", "correct": "Wendy", "options": ["Iggy", "Lemmy", "Roy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWendy.\n\n\tWendy is basically the same boss as Lemmy, only she has a different battle arena.  She should be relatively easy, but the hard part is navigating your way through her castle.  You'll have to avoid saws, large spiky pillars, and weird fiery orbs to get to her room.  Wendy is the sixth Koopa sibling you fight on the journey. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the seventh boss in the game?", "correct": "Larry", "options": ["Lois", "Lemmy", "Ludwig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry.\n\n\tLarry Koopa is found just outside Bowser's Castle in the Valley of Bowser.  His battle is pretty much the same as Iggy's, but again, his fortress is very tough to navigate through.  It's good to find the mid-way point so that you don't need to start the level all over again if you die. \n"}, {"text": "How many fortresses contain the Reznor bosses?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["One", "None", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tReznors are the four dinosaur-like creatures that are on the spinning wheel.  To destroy them, you need to jump up into the bottom of the platform that is holding them.  Once all four are dead, you've beaten the fortress.  They can be found in the Vanilla Dome, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, and Valley of Bowser. \n"}, {"text": "What are the enemies that you must hit Bowser with in order to defeat him?", "correct": "Mechakoopas & Mechakoopa & & Mecha-Koopas & Mecha Koopas & Mecha-Koopa & Mecha Koopa", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMechakoopas & Mechakoopa & & Mecha-Koopas & Mecha Koopas & Mecha-Koopa & Mecha Koopa.\n\n\tMechakoopas are the wind-up toy enemies that are only found in Bowser's Castle.  Once you jump on them, they are temporarily paralyzed, so you can pick them up and throw them at Bowser.  Once you defeat Bowser, you save the princess and the credits roll.  The game may not be over though.  There may still be other worlds for you to find. :) \n"}, {"text": "Birdo makes an appearance as a boss in this game.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBirdo first appeared as a mini-boss that was scattered around Sub-con, the main setting of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" for the NES.  The \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" game is also available for Game Boy and Super Nintendo.  Birdo doesn't appear at all in \"Super Mario World\". \n"}, {"text": "What area is Lemmy's castle in?", "correct": "Vanilla Dome", "options": ["Forest of Illusion", "Donut Plains", "Valley of Bowser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVanilla Dome.\n\n\tLemmy's castle is the third on the journey through \"Super Mario World\".  Lemmy's castle contains Magikoopas and many Koopa Skeletons.  Lemmy's boss battle is basically the same as Wendy's only it's in a different room. \n"}, {"text": "Roy is in the fourth castle.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tRoy is within the fifth castle in the \"Forest of Illusions\".  In his boss battle, you'll need to make sure you defeat him quick because every few seconds, the walls begin to close in more and more.  Sometimes, you'll need to watch out because he'll walk onto the ceiling and you can't attack him. \n"}, {"text": "How many times must you jump on Morton Koopa to kill him?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["One", "Four", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tMorton is almost like an easier version of Roy.  The only difference is that he doesn't wear awesome shades like Roy does, and the walls don't close in during his battle.  Morton can be found in the second castle in Donut Plains. \n"}, {"text": "Ludwig Von Koopa is in one of the castles as well.  What happens when you try to blow up his castle?", "correct": "It crashes into a mountain", "options": ["Mario gets caught in the explosion", "It doesn't explode", "It crumbles to the ground"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt crashes into a mountain.\n\n\tEvery time you defeat a boss, a cut-scene and some dialogue appear on the screen.  Mario destroys the castle in different ways each time, and in this case, he blows the castle into the air and it crashes into a nearby mountain.  The result is a horrible boo-boo on the mountain that needs to be covered by a bandage. :) \n"}]}
