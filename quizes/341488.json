I could only buy what could fit in the dorm, so I got some dumbbells.\n\nWhat exactly are dumbbells?", "correct": "Hand weights", "options": ["Resistance bands", "Type of treadmill", "A ringer to call for help in case you do something stupid (dumb bell)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHand weights.\n\n\tDumbbells, or barbells, are types of hand weights.  The weight in each dumbbell is built into the entire bar instead of having the weights added to an additional bar likes traditional weights.  Dumbbells can be very light, such as the 1 pound or 2 pound weights, but they can get very heavy, such as the 35 pound and 50 pound weights. \n"}, {"text": "I love Tony Little.  Being a college student, I have no room for big equipment, so I love his workout machine.  It can fold easily and slide underneath my bed.  By what animal name is Tony Little's workout machine known as?", "correct": "Gazelle", "options": ["Rhino", "Trumpeter Swan", "Butterfly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGazelle.\n\n\tThe Gazelle is a workout machine that is similar to a stepping machine and a treadmill all-in-one.  It is designed as a base with two swinging platforms for your feet. You can also hold onto the handles and move the Gazelle using your arms, giving you a full-body workout. \n"}, {"text": "As I've said, in a college dorm room, there is not much space for workout equipment.  So I have dedicated a small shelf to workout DVDs, some of which are DVDs by Beachbody.\n\nAll of these are Beachbody workouts, but which of them was developed by Tony Horton?", "correct": "P90X", "options": ["Turbo Jam", "Insanity", "All of these were developed by Tony Horton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nP90X.\n\n\t\"P90X\" was developed by Tony Horton, and it is known for being a seriously difficult workout, and not for the light of heart.  According to ads for the product, if you follow the regimen very closely, and dedicate about an hour a day to working out, you'll be ripped in 90 days.\r \"Insanity\", however, developed by Shaun T, is a similar workout that will get you ripped in only 60 days.  It is not recommended for those who are unfit.\r \"Turbo Jam\" was developed by Chalene Johnson. \n"}, {"text": "Of course, you can get a good workout in without having any equipment at all!  There are exercises that you can do at any time; and at any place.\n\nAll of these exercises you can do without equipment of any kind.  However, there is one of them that would require something... Which is it?", "correct": "Pull-ups", "options": ["Curl-ups", "Push-ups", "Sit-ups"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPull-ups.\n\n\tThree of these exercises need no equipment; but to perform pull-ups, you need a bar.  Pull-ups are when you try and lift yourself up over a bar as many times as you can.  They are also often called chin-ups.  If you do not have a hanging bar, you can improvise by using a resistance band.\r Push-ups, curl-ups, and sit-ups all require no equipment and can be done anywhere.  Heck, sit down and do some sit-ups in the supermarket aisle, for all I care.  It can be done if you don't mind looking silly. \n"}, {"text": "One of my favorite exercises does not take much space.  Some call them \"mason twists\".  Simply sit on your bum, straighten your back, lift your feet (keeping them together), lean back, clench your hands together, and twist your arms side to side, hitting the ground to your left, your right, left, right, etc.\n\nWhat part of your body does the \"mason twist\" work out?", "correct": "Abdominals", "options": ["Pectorals", "Hamstrings", "Those little itty bitty muscles in your fingers and wrists"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbdominals.\n\n\tThe \"mason twist\" is meant to work out your abdominals.  When you are twisting your body back and forth, you are working on your abs.  Raising your legs increases the difficulty; and the workout for your abs.  Keeping your back as straight as possible is a safety thing; an arched back while twisting your body can be dangerous. \n"}, {"text": "I like using these devices because they can roll up and easily store.  There are all sorts of things you can do with them; step on them and stretch it above your head, put them around a sturdy pole or tree and pull your arms back, etc.  The possibilities are endless.  You just have to make sure not to stretch them too far; otherwise they might snap.  What are they called?", "correct": "Resistance bands", "options": ["Rubber bands", "Rock bands", "Pully bands"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResistance bands.\n\n\tResistance bands are wonderful exercise tools.  You can use them to replace weights, and how far you stretch, what size resistance band you use, its pressure, etc. can greatly affect the workout.  If you use a heavy duty resistance band and stretch it very far, it could be like pulling a 100 pound or heavier weight!  You can also use the bands to get the same workout you would get by doing pull-ups, but they are a bit easier than lifting your entire weight up.\r Resistance bands can generally stretch to three times their size, but it is advised not to stretch it more than this.  Trust me, it hurts when one snaps and hits you in the stomach (or anywhere, for that matter). \n"}, {"text": "\"I'm sexy and I know it.  I WORK OUT!\"\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I was listening to my iPod.  I always listen to music while I work out.\n\nResearch has shown that listening to music while you work out can actually help you burn more calories.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tSurprisingly, this is true!  The main reason is because listening to music can get you to sing.  Singing, just like laughter and just plain talking, causes you to breathe more often, and thus singing actually burns calories.  Of course, this does not mean you should karaoke for an entire \"workout\"...  Singing isn't THAT effective.\r By the way, the words in quotation marks in the question are lyrics to \"Sexy and I Know It\" by LMFAO. \n"}, {"text": "As a video game addict, I tend to play games as my \"workout\".  Imagine my thrill when Microsoft came up with a video game where you are the controller.  It might be a video game console, but believe me, you get quite the burn if you play it too long.  Which of these is a Microsoft system where you are the controller?", "correct": "Xbox Kinect", "options": ["Nintendo Wii", "Sega Wiggle", "Playstation Move"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXbox Kinect.\n\n\tThe Kinect is for the Xbox 360.  It is unique from any gaming system of its generation because it requires no controller.  You can turn on the Xbox 360 and get into a game without a controller, and you can play Kinect games without a controller.  The Kinect device is a little camera that senses your movement and puts it on the screen.\r There are tons of games on the Kinect, including sports games, adventure games, and dancing games.\r Remember when the Wii game out and we all got our workouts in through that, then discovered that we could all sit on the sofa while we bowled?  The Kinect solves this loophole problem...  It will not even let you play if you are sitting down. \n"}, {"text": "Since I have no room for a full gym in my dorm room, I purchased a nice little stepping device.  I am able to count my steps every day, and my goal is 10,000 steps a day.  When I don't reach it throughout the day, I'll go out for a walk until I reach that desired number.  Which of these devices counts steps?", "correct": "Pedometer", "options": ["Speedometer", "Spacemaker", "Pacemaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPedometer.\n\n\tA pedometer is a little device that attaches to your hip (on a belt loop or on the band itself) and counts the steps you make in a day.  Nicer models work far better than the cheap plastic ones you buy at the dollar store; so if you're serious about counting steps, spring for a bit nicer of a pedometer.  The cheap ones count steps when you wiggle in your chair.\r A speedometer measures the speed you are going in a vehicle, and a pacemaker is something that goes in someone's heart to help monitor it.  No idea what a spacemaker is, I made that up.  Perhaps it is someone who throws out all your stuff to make room for something else. \n"}, {"text": "In my dorm room, I have one piece of \"large\" equipment.  It is a simple machine that has you climbing a ladder.  The ladder continuously moves, so, if you have the stamina, you could climb it for hours and hours and never reach the top.  By what biblical name does this machine go?", "correct": "Jacob's Ladder", "options": ["David's Ladder", "Paul's Ladder", "Joshua's Ladder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJacob's Ladder.\n\n\tIn the book of Genesis, Jacob dreams about a ladder that ascends to heaven.  Therefore, the piece of exercise equipment that is simply a never-ending ladder takes this name.  The Jacob's Ladder machine works similar to a treadmill.  However, the conveyor, instead of a belt, is a ladder.  As you climb the ladder, the bottom rung moves down, so you never really reach the top.  It keeps cycling so you stay in the same spot.\r A similar machine is used for rock climbing walls.  Because the rock climbing wall is constantly moving at whatever speed you adjust it to, you never reach the top.  You continue to climb, and the wall is moving down.  I guess it would be called a \"Jacob's Wall\". \n"}]}
