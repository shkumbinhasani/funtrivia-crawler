Kira is at his side when he is welcomed \"home\" by fellow shapeshifters. \n"}, {"text": "Odo is invited by a fellow shapeshifter (Salome Jens) to stay on the rogue planet with the rest of his people.  What is this shapeshifter's name?", "correct": "It's never said", "options": ["Ala", "Uzu", "Iri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never said.\n\n\tOddly, Salome Jens' character has no name.

The Symbiosis Commission of Trill claims that a symbiont and an unsuitable host would prove incompatible within a few days...but the case of Joran Dax proves them wrong.  How long did the Dax symbiont remain in Joran?", "correct": "six months", "options": ["thirteen months", "three months", "sixteen months"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsix months.\n\n\tA massive secret about Trill society is revealed in this episode...but only to Dax, Sisko, and Dr. Bashir.

This episode boasts, without a doubt, the most forced, desperate script to date on the show.  Even an inspired performance by Siddig El Fadil (and some excellent \"old age\" make-up) couldn't save this turkey.  Ugh.  (Somewhere, LadyMac is laughing!) \n"}, {"text": "Garak's tailor shop is blown to smithereens in \"Improbable Cause.\"  Who blew it up?", "correct": "Garak", "options": ["Enabran Tain (Paul Dooley)", "an unidentified Romulan", "an unidentified Klingon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarak.\n\n\tDespite a number of red herrings, Odo eventually discovers that Garak blew up his own shop, just to get an investigation started to find out who really DID want to kill him.

Which one?", "correct": "Leeta (Chase Masterson)", "options": ["Rom", "Garak", "Jake Sisko"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeeta (Chase Masterson).\n\n\tOddly, dabo girl Leeta -- who had appeared exactly ONCE before this episode -- has somehow become important enough to Jadzia to be invited to the all-important \"zhian'tara\" ritual.  Gotta love those convenient plot leaps, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Adversary,\" Benjamin Sisko is finally promoted to the rank of captain.

Jadzia Dax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake Sisko.\n\n\tOddly, Jake Sisko -- who is not, of course, even a member of Starfleet -- has the honor of granting Ben his fourth pip, and is the first person in the series to call his father \"Captain.\"  Sweet, but kind of weird. \n"}]}
