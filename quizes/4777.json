{"id": "4777", "name": "Animal Rhymes | 10 Question Brain Teasers Multiple Choice Quiz", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "Rhymes"], "questions": [{"text": "What two word rhyming phrase would you use to refer to a LARGE BOAR?", "correct": "Big Pig", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBig Pig.\n\n\tDescended from Eurasian wild boars, today's domestic pigs are generally livestock animals raised on farms.  Even-toed ungulates (or Artiodactyl creatures), pigs share the same order classification as giraffes, hippos, camels, and cows.\r If we're looking at big pigs, the biggest tracked by the 'Guinness Book of World Records' in the twentieth century was Big Bill, a 2.5-ton pig who was raised in Tennessee in the 1930s. \n"}, {"text": "In two words, what would be an ULTRAMARINE FEMALE SHEEP?", "correct": "Blue Ewe", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue Ewe.\n\n\tWhile female sheep are known as ewes, male sheep are rams (and babies are lambs).  Regardless of sex, sheep tend to grow wool and are one of the most reliable resources for animal fibre in the world.  Sheep are generally kept as livestock for this purpose and for food.\r Interestingly, there is a creature from the Himalayas known as the bharal, or the 'blue sheep'.  An odd creature, it isn't aquamarine and it isn't in the same family as sheep.  It's actually more related to cattle and goats. \n"}, {"text": "What two word phrase would you use for an ILL-FITTING ANTLERED DEER?", "correct": "Loose Moose", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoose Moose.\n\n\tMoose, or elk, are the largest members of the deer family and are, by and large, solitary animals, so while it would be unlikely to see an ill-fitting one in the clothing sense, you'd be harder-pressed to find a group of moose.  Found in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the boreal forests of Northern Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia, moose are known for their distinctive and massive antlers.\r Famously, the opening credits of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" featured some ill-fitting moose.  Moose bites can be pretty nasty... \n"}, {"text": "If you're rhyming, what two words would you use to make THE FASTEST CAT, BUT FASTER?", "correct": "Fleeter Cheetah", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFleeter Cheetah.\n\n\tThe fastest land animal, cheetahs can run along the flat African savannah at what was once believed to be around one hundred kilometres an hour at a general maximum.  The cheetah's habitat stretches from the edge of the Sahara down to the far south of the African continent, but you'd be likely to find them in protected areas like the Serengeti.\r The recorded speeds of the fastest cheetahs in the world have varied over time with some claiming that the top speeds have reached up to 128 kilometres an hour.  GPS technology has placed max speeds in the wild a fair bit lower. \n"}, {"text": "What two word rhyme would be used for A LIGHTLY-COLOURED SEA MAMMAL?", "correct": "Pale Whale", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPale Whale.\n\n\tAmongst the largest creatures in the sea, whales are massive marine animals that are actually mammals and not fish, having evolved from creatures on land that previously had legs.  Whales are highly intelligent creatures, often travelling in small pods around typical routes in the ocean.  There is also a large variety of whales out there from killer whales to blue whales to sperm whales and more.\r Perhaps the palest of the whales is the beluga which, also known as 'the white whale', is found in the Arctic Ocean.  The white colouring allows the beluga to hide from predators amongst snow and icebergs. \n"}, {"text": "In two rhyming words, what could you call a DARK HIMALAYAN OX?", "correct": "Black Yak", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Yak.\n\n\tYaks are native to the Himalayan region of Asia though their general footprint stretches all the way out to further reaches of Mongolia where they're used as pack animals.  Bulky and furry creatures, they're hearty animals that are also valuable for their thick, wooly hides, especially since people in these regions need warm clothes.\r Yak fur varies in colour from black to brown to white.  The rarest colour for a yak is golden fur. \n"}, {"text": "What two words could describe an UNCOMMON JACKRABBIT?", "correct": "Rare Hare", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRare Hare.\n\n\tWhile most jackrabbits are classified as hares, hares are not rabbits.  Both are part of the Leporidae family, but are distinct in their own ways, with hares generally being larger and tending to live above ground (outside of burrows).  Hares are also, generally, much faster due to the strength of their legs; there are clear reasons why Aesop's fables included a quick hare in the race against a tortoise.\r One of the rarest hares in the world may be the Hispid hare, native to South Asia.  An endangered species, its habitat has long been threatened by encroaching urban sprawl in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. \n"}, {"text": "A VIKING STEED could also be known by what two word rhyme?", "correct": "Norse Horse", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorse Horse.\n\n\tInterestingly, the Norwegian Fjord Horse would be the go-to to follow up on this question.  Considered one of the world's oldest breeds of horse, it's likely a descendant of the Mongolian wild horse which would have been brought over from Asia more than four thousand years ago.  This type of horse was cited to be used by Vikings in land battles due to their heartiness and reliability, traits that would also serve them well in farming and agriculture, especially in the rugged landscape of Scandinavia. \n"}, {"text": "What would be a two word rhyme used to describe a FUNNY GOAT?", "correct": "Silly Billy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilly Billy.\n\n\tHoofed animals (or ruminants, as they're known), goats are similar to cows in the sense that they are both grazing livestock and they both have four stomach chambers to better-digest grasses and plant life.  Horned and bearded, these farm creatures are also known for their strong balance and ability to be milked; goats' milk is commonly made into different types of cheese.  A billy goat is a male goat.\r If we're looking at silly billies, you might not look further than the video game \"Goat Simulator\" in which you can control a goat and get into curious hi-jinx in real-time. \n"}, {"text": "A HORNED BOVINE THAT HAS EATEN ENOUGH would also make sense as what two word rhyme?", "correct": "Full Bull", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFull Bull.\n\n\tA male cow, a bull is an oft-horned and, frequently (seen as) temperamental creature typically found on a ranch.  Most bulls, since they won't produce milk, are generally used in beef production.  Famously, cartoon bulls and other fictional depictions of bulls see these animals infuriated by the colour red.  This, however, is a bit of a misconception.\r Bulls generally eat grasses and, during the winter, farmers will supplement their food with grain. \n"}]}
