{"id": "353081", "name": "Hot Crossed Bunnies Quiz | Thematic Animals | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Thematic Animals", "Thematic Rabbits"], "questions": [{"text": "Someone has turned the tables on poor Little Bunny Foo Foo by picking him up and doing to him what he once did to some unfortunate field mice.  What must they be doing to this poor bunny to make him so cross?", "correct": "Bopping him on the head", "options": ["Stealing his cheese", "Playing with his floppy ears", "Tugging on his tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBopping him on the head.\n\n\tAccording to the old poem, Little Bunny Foo Foo hopped through the forest until he came upon some field mice and proceeded to bop them on the head without any real rhyme or reason.  After a scolding from a fairy, Bunny Foo Foo seemed to be let off with a warning and, presumably, a lesson about abuse in the animal kingdom.\r But alas!  The tables have turned-- someone is bopping Little Bunny Foo Foo and it's not at all appreciated.\r The origin of the song is unknown but it has been used as a moral tale for decades.  Evidently, someone took it a step too far. \n"}, {"text": "Some rabbit out there must be very cross if he's missing a body part.  What part of the rabbit is considered 'lucky'?", "correct": "Foot", "options": ["Ear", "Tail", "Nose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFoot.\n\n\tThe lucky rabbit's foot is a superstitious good luck charm dating thousands of years back to Europe and Asia though its true origin is unknown.  Nowadays it's possible to find faux fur rabbits feet on keychains and the like, though these are often kitsch items.  Several cultures and lore, including North American Indians, Celtic beliefs, and Chinese customs, talk about the rabbit's foot as being a charm under special circumstances though there's clearly something ill at play-- the cross rabbit certainly has the worst luck of them all.\r You can understand why, I'm sure. \n"}, {"text": "One particular rabbit was quite frustrated and anxious being late in a book by Lewis Carroll.  Some writers have the nerve to hold their bunnies back for appointments it seems.  What colour was this famous literary rabbit?", "correct": "White", "options": ["Red", "Brown", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite.\n\n\tSeen in the first chapters of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, the White Rabbit is late for a very important date.  It turns out, he's late for serving the Queen of Hearts; he reappears late in the book when the titular Alice is placed on trial for the crime's she's committed in this topsy-turvy world.\r The White Rabbit has since become one of the most famous characters from the book and subsequent Disney film; Jefferson Airplane wrote a song called \"White Rabbit\" in 1967 based on the character and others from Carroll's work.\r But could you imagine being eternally late?  The poor rabbit has every reason to be cross. \n"}, {"text": "Are you being withholding?  According to advertisements, why can't a certain rabbit eat Trix cereal?", "correct": "Because Trix are for kids", "options": ["Because it's high in fiber", "Because they'd just want more", "Because it's just too good to be true"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause Trix are for kids.\n\n\tSometimes it's just unfair, am I right bunnies?  International commercials for the General Mills/Nestle breakfast cereal Trix is known for featuring a white bunny dressed in a disguise attempting to obtain a box of Trix cereal for his own consumption.  It never seems to work; the bunny is told at the last moment that he can't have any-- \"Trix are for kids!\"\r Trix cereal consists of colourful corn puffs, kind of like Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal.  It would probably be unsafe to feed them to an actual bunny.\r It doesn't make it any better for the bunnies though. \n"}, {"text": "Humans always find a way to glamourize the dark side of bunny life.  Cartoonist Andy Riley usually depicts his bunnies doing which of the following?", "correct": "Committing suicide", "options": ["Wearing expensive make-up", "Smoking", "Engaging in lewd activities"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommitting suicide.\n\n\tIn 2003, UK cartoonist and humourist Andy Riley published the popular \"Book of Bunny Suicides\", a series of (usually) single-panel comics depicting bunnies attempting to kill themselves in unorthodox ways.  While the comics were rarely if ever graphic, there was indeed a certain amount of morbidity.  Most enjoyed the dark humour though; a sequel was written a year later and it has since seen relative success in other markets (posters, souvenirs, t-shirts, etc.).\r Bunnies don't need you to see them in this light though; that's just wrong. \n"}, {"text": "\"Of course you know, this means war.\"  Bugs Bunny was certainly cross in \"Long-Haired Hare\" (1949).  To get revenge on an opera singer, he posed as which famous conductor?", "correct": "Leopold Stokowski", "options": ["Arturo Toscanini", "Leonard Bernstein", "James Levine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeopold Stokowski.\n\n\tThe line was based on one previously said by Groucho Marx years before though it carried on through numerous Looney Tunes sketches including Bugs.  In the sketch \"Long-Haired Hare\", Bugs attempted to be his normal, loud self until an opera singer, living and practicing his craft at a residence nearby, decided to put an end to Bugs' noisy instrument playing.  This led to a final battle onstage at the Hollywood Bowl in which Bugs, in the guise of Leopold Stokowski (\"It's Leopold!\"), seemingly won the battle.\r It wasn't Bugs' only foray into opera, either.  In \"What's Opera, Doc?\", he and Elmer Fudd reenacted the operas of Wagner.  No one could forget \"Kill the wabbit\", could they?  It happened again in \"Rabbit of Seville\".\r Just more proof that you shouldn't make a bunny cross. \n"}, {"text": "This isn't our fault, but one hare ended up missing out on the win of a lifetime in a race against a tortoise, at least according to Aesop.  Why is this?", "correct": "He fell asleep", "options": ["Rabbits lack the ability to compete in races", "He couldn't find his way", "His shoelace was untied"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe fell asleep.\n\n\tIn the famous Aesop fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\", the two animals head out on a race against one another.  Although the hare takes an obvious early lead, the race ends in an upset as the hare gets too cocky, falls asleep on a tree stump, and allows the tortoise to pull ahead to win the race.  The moral of the story: physical prowess does not make a winner.  Disney release a cartoon about this fable in 1935.\r Sometimes, rabbits are cross with their own choices.  This one isn't even our fault, but there you have it! \n"}, {"text": "Sometimes we ask too much of our bunnies.  In North America, the Energizer Bunny just keeps going and going because of an excessive amount of battery life.  What does he do with this energy?", "correct": "Beats a drum", "options": ["Talks really fast", "Hops in circles", "Dances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeats a drum.\n\n\tThe Energizer Bunny was introduced as the mascot for Energizer batteries in the late 1980s appearing on TV in hundreds of advertizements.  The motto seems to be that he just \"keeps going and going and going and going...\"  It seems like a lot of work for a poor rabbit.\r The Energizer Bunny is never seen without a pair of sunglasses and a large drum which on which he keeps a beat, perhaps until the end of time (or until his batteries eventually run out).  Internationally, Duracell (which also sells batteries in North American markets) also uses a pink bunny as a mascot.\r Well of course he's cross-- sometimes you've gotta give a bunny a break.  Imagine the headache... \n"}, {"text": "He doesn't show it, but what 'framed' cartoon rabbit would've been very cross during the plot of a 1988 movie combining live-action with animation?", "correct": "Roger Rabbit", "options": ["Peter Rabbit", "Br'er Rabbit", "The Easter Bunny"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoger Rabbit.\n\n\t\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" starred Bob Hoskins as a human detective and the voice talents of Charles Fleischer as the titular Roger Rabbit.  Based on the book \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" written in 1981, the movie involved the murder of an influential cartoon city overseer and the subsequent (and zany) mystery behind the death and missing will.  Roger and Detective Eddie Valiant teamed up to solve the case.  The movie features several characters from Warner Bros. and Disney films and features one of the only scenes ever made containing both Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.\r But I mean wrongful accusal; what bunny wouldn't be cross? \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps it was only his job, but the Killer Bunny in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975) seemed cross.  What location did he guard the entrance to?", "correct": "The Cave of Caerbannog", "options": ["The Gorge of Eternal Peril", "Castle Anthrax", "The Bridge of Death"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cave of Caerbannog.\n\n\tThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog was certainly a memorable aspect of this absurd film and its appearance only continues to trivialize King Arthur's epic quest for the lost Holy Grail.  In this particular scene, Tim the Enchanter brings the Knights of the Round Table to the cave entrance only to face off against this manic bunny.  After losing several knights, they destroy the creature using the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch brought along by Brother Maynard.\r Certainly a bunny can be so cross that he is forced to kill.  This is why you shouldn't anger a rabbit! \n"}]}
