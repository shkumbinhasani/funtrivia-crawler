How many people are credited with having directed 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'?", "correct": "2 & two", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n2 & two.\n\n\tEric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm, both contributors to the 'Batman' animated TV series, directed 'Batman: MOTP.' \n"}, {"text": "Who speaks the first line in the film?", "correct": "Chuckie Sol", "options": ["Buzz Bronski", "Batman", "Alfred Pennyworth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChuckie Sol.\n\n\tThe film opens on Chuckie Sol and his henchmen. Chuckie's first line is, 'This has been a long time comin',' in reference to a major counterfeiting scheme he and his gang have been putting together for some time.  I've always interpreted that line as having a double meaning as well, in that the first animated Batman film was also \"a long time in coming\"! \n"}, {"text": "When we first see Andrea Beaumont, she is on an airplane, looking at a magazine featuring Bruce Wayne on the cover. What magazine is it?", "correct": "Fortune", "options": ["Esquire", "GQ", "Forbes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFortune.\n\n\tThe article is entitled, 'Bruce Wayne: One of the Wealthiest Entrepeneurs in Gotham.' \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following people does NOT provide his or her vocal talents in the movie?", "correct": "Loren Lester", "options": ["Abe Vigoda", "Dana Delany", "Mark Hamill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoren Lester.\n\n\tHamill reprises his amazing work as the Joker from the 'Batman' animated series. Abe Vigoda voices infirm mobster Salvatore Valestra. Dana Delany is the voice of Andrea Beaumont, Bruce Wayne's long-lost love -- a role that led to her being selected as the voice of Lois Lane for the 'Superman' animated series a few years later. Loren Lester provided the voice of Dick Grayson, the original Robin (and later Nightwing) on the animated series, but his character does not appear in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "In one of the many flashbacks in the movie, we see the first time that young Bruce Wayne met Andrea Beaumont. Where did they meet?", "correct": "a cemetery", "options": ["Wayne Manor", "the Gotham World's Fair", "in a taxi"], "explanation": "\n\n\na cemetery.\n\n\tAs Bruce was paying his respects at his parents' grave, he overheard Andrea talking to her mother's headstone, and approached her. \n"}, {"text": "Another flashback we're treated to features Bruce's first night out as a masked vigilante. He hadn't yet adopted the Batman persona, so he was clad in black tights, a ski mask, and a primitive utility belt. Which of the following items did we NOT see him pull from said utility belt during his apprehension of a gang of thieves on that first night?", "correct": "a grappling hook and rope", "options": ["a hammer", "ATD's (anti-tire devices)", "shuriken (throwing stars)"], "explanation": "\n\n\na grappling hook and rope.\n\n\tBruce uses shuriken to disarm several of the handgun-bearing thieves; he later uses a hammer to bash in the windshield of the getaway car, and uses ATD's (small spiked spheres) to puncture its tires. We never see him using a grappling hook or rope on that first night. \n"}, {"text": "During that same flashback chronicling Bruce's escapade atop the thieves' getaway car, he is spotted by a uniformed officer (in a squad car) who will later become a significant member of the Gotham City Police Department. Who is it?", "correct": "Harvey Bullock", "options": ["James Gordon", "Sarah Essen", "Renee Montoya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvey Bullock.\n\n\tDetective Bullock is very anti-Batman in the animated series (and, appropriately, in 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'), but in the comics, he's more of an ally. It was kind of funny to see him as a donut-scarfing patrolman in the flashback. \n"}, {"text": "The first time Andrea visits Bruce at his home, he is out on the front lawn, conducting a martial arts workout. Which martial art does he say he is practicing?", "correct": "jiu-jitsu", "options": ["tae kwon do", "aikido", "judo"], "explanation": "\n\n\njiu-jitsu.\n\n\tAndrea asks Bruce what he's doing; he responds with, 'Jiu-jitsu,' and shows off a little. \n"}, {"text": "The Phantasm's imminent victims -- all of them mobsters -- always hear a certain sentence before they die. What is it?", "correct": "'Your angel of death awaits.'", "options": ["'Your time has come.'", "'You should have made sure I was dead.'", "'You reap what you sow.'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Your angel of death awaits.'\n\n\tThe Phantasm says this to all four of the men whose heads are on the chopping block -- Chuckie Sol, Buzz Bronski, Salvatore Valestra, and the Joker. \n"}, {"text": "At one point in the film, we see Batman exhibit a rather useful skill. What is it?", "correct": "the ability to read lips", "options": ["the ability to read braille", "the ability to speak Russian", "the ability to interpret sign language"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe ability to read lips.\n\n\tBatman spies on Andrea Beaumont and Arthur Reeves as they dine in a restaurant across the street from his rain-soaked surveillance spot.

What is it?", "correct": "A flock of bats pours out of a fissure in the ground", "options": ["It starts raining furiously", "Andrea accidentally drops the engagement ring down a well", "Lightning strikes a nearby tree"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA flock of bats pours out of a fissure in the ground.\n\n\tPerhaps a bit much, but I appreciated the symbolism -- Bruce's mission will not allow him a \"conventional\" life. \n"}, {"text": "Just moments before Alfred presents Bruce with a disturbing letter from Andrea, a fairly momentous event takes place.

What does Alfred say upon witnessing this momentous event?", "correct": "My god", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy god.\n\n\tAlfred looks and sounds positively terrified -- which is kind of the point of Bruce's dressing up like a bat in the first place, one assumes. \n"}, {"text": "In a rather bizarre sequence, we see that the Joker has set up residence in the 'House of the Future' exhibit at the abandoned Gotham World's Fair, complete with a robotic 'wife' and 'dog.'

Which language does he NOT utilize in 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'?", "correct": "German", "options": ["Italian", "French", "Spanish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGerman.\n\n\tJoker says to Sal Valestra, 'Mi casa nostra es su casa nostra,' incoporating both the familiar Spanish adage 'Mi casa es su casa' ('My home is your home') and the Italian phrase 'cosa nostra', a Mafia reference meaning, literally, 'our thing.' (He also refers to Sal as his 'paisan,' or 'friend.') In that same conversation, he uses the French word 'certainmente' instead of 'certainly.' He never speaks a word of German in the film. \n"}, {"text": "In a rather intense sequence, Batman is hunted down and cornered by the full might of the Gotham City Police Department.

What is Batman's characteristically steely response?", "correct": "Whatever it takes & Whatever it takes. & Whatever it takes!", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhatever it takes & Whatever it takes. & Whatever it takes!\n\n\tPretty determined, our boy Bruce. \n"}, {"text": "Who speaks the last line in the film?", "correct": "Andrea Beaumont", "options": ["Batman", "the Joker", "Alfred Pennyworth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrea Beaumont.\n\n\tAndrea, having miraculously survived the final battle, is shown on an ocean liner, bound for parts unknown.

These are the last words spoken in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "A number of major plot elements and events in this film were clearly inspired by events depicted in significant arcs from the 'Batman' comic books. Which of the following story arcs did NOT contribute to the events of 'Mask of the Phantasm'?", "correct": "'Batman: Year Three' ('Batman' no. 436 - 439)", "options": ["'Batman: Year One' ('Batman' no. 404-407)", "'Batman: Year Two' ('Detective Comics' no. 575 - 578)", "Events from all of these story arcs were integrated into the film"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Batman: Year Three' ('Batman' no. 436 - 439)\n\n\tThe sequence in which Batman is brutally ambushed at a construction site by the GCPD is lifted straight out of 'Batman: Year One,' right down to the design of the uniforms the police officers wear. Most of 'Batman: Year Two' centers around a vicious, vengeance-fueled vigilante named the Reaper, who was the father of Bruce Wayne's great lost love; the Phantasm strongly resembles the Reaper in terms of both physical appearance and motivation, and the 'lost love' element is at play in the film, as well.'Batman: Year Three' focuses on Bruce's taking in Dick Grayson and training him to be Robin...but Robin never even appears in 'Mask of the Phantasm.' \n"}]}
