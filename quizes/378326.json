Which three-time Australian Prime Minister was in office at the time of the original landing?", "correct": "Andrew Fisher", "options": ["Robert Menzies", "Alfred Deakin", "Billy Hughes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndrew Fisher.\n\n\tThe WWI Gallipoli Campaign began on April 25, 1915 with Anzac troops landing on the Gallipoli peninsular in the Ottoman Empire. The peninsular, now known as the Gelibolu district, stands on the northern bank of the Dardanelles, the narrow strait in northwestern Turkey that connects the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara. \r One of the greatest Ottoman victories during the war, the Gallipoli Campaign lasted more than seven months, until January 9, 1916. Despite the eventual defeat, \"ANZAC Day\", April 25, is today the most important commemoration of veterans and military casualties in both Australia and New Zealand.\r Andrew Fisher was born in 1862 in the village of Crosshouse, near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire in Scotland. He became a member of the inaugural Australian Parliament in 1901, representing the division of Wide Bay in Queensland. He succeeded Chris Watson as Labor Party leader in October 1907 and a year later became Australia's fifth Prime Minister, taking over from Alfred Deakin. Fisher's first period in office lasted just seven months, until June 1909, but he returned to the Premiership for a 3-year term in 1910. Fisher spent the next 15 months as Leader of the Opposition, during which time Australia entered WWI as members of the British Empire force. Fisher returned for his third term as Prime Minister in September 1914, and it was during this 13-month period in office that ANZAC troops landed at Gallipoli. By the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, Fisher had departed and been replaced as PM by Billy Hughes. (The fourth alternative, Robert Menzies, was Australian PM during WWII.) \n"}, {"text": "You probably know that Charles II was King of England at the time of the Great Fire of London and the Black Death.

Charles II reigned in England from 1660 until 1685.\r Louis XIV, also known as Louis the Great or The Sun King, is the longest-reigning monarch in European history. He became king at the age of just four in 1643, and remained on the French throne until his death aged 76 in 1715.\r Of the alternatives, Philip VI was the 14th-century French king during part of the Hundred Years War and, particularly, at the time of the Battle of Crecy; Charles VII was the 15th-century French king who handed Joan of Arc over to the English for execution; and Louis XVI was famously executed during the French Revolution at the end of the 18th-century. \n"}, {"text": "The American Civil War dominated Abraham Lincoln's presidency. It is ironic that one of greatest but also short-lived Presidents should reign at the same time as one of the greatest, but also the longest-ever serving elected Pope. Who was on the Papal Throne throughout Lincoln's time in office?", "correct": "Pius IX", "options": ["Adrian I", "Urban VII", "Leo XIII"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPius IX.\n\n\tBorn in 1809 in the town of Hodgenville in central Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln was elected as a Member of the Illinois House of Representatives at the age of just 25 and later represented the state of Illinois in Congress for two years (between 1847 and 1849).\r He was elected as the 16th President of the U.S. in November 1860, but two months before his inauguration the following March seven states seceded from the Union to form the Confederacy, and thus sparking the American Civil War. His Presidency is remembered for many great speeches, not least the Gettysburg Address, delivered in little over two minutes on a Thursday afternoon, November 19, 1863. \r The war effectively ended with Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, five days before Lincoln's assassination by John Wilkes Booth. Three weeks after that, the war officially ended with the May 9 proclamation, although the last shot was not fired until six weeks later, on June 22, 1865. \r On the other side of the planet, Pius IX was engaged in the longest ever papacy. Born Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti in 1792 in the commune of Senigallia in Ancona province on the Adriatic coast of Italy, Pius IX was elected Pope in June 1846 at the relatively young age of 54. By the time of his death 11,560 days later, he had served 31 years 7 months and 23 days in office, more than five years longer than any elected Pope before of since. (Pope John Paul II, 1978-2005, has come closer than anyone to matching Pius's papacy in terms of length.)\r Pius's reign is notable for the establishment of the concept of 'papal infallibility' by the 'First Vatican Council' (1869-70). He is also the last Pope to reign over the Papal States, which were invaded by the Italian Army in 1870 and incorporated into the recently-established (1861) Kingdom of Italy. \r Of the alternatives, Urban VII is the shortest-lived of all Popes, his papacy lasting just 13 days in September 1590; Leo XIII followed Pius IX as Pope and is the only other Pope whose papacy exceeded 25 years; and Adrian I (Pope from 772-795) who held the record for the longest papacy for more than 1,000 years (until passed by Pius VI, 1775-1799). \n"}, {"text": "The Munich Olympic Games were memorable for the sporting exploits of Mark Spitz and Olga Korbut, but they were also marred by terrorist atrocities that saw eleven Israeli athletes and coaches killed.

In a botched rescue attempt, all of the hostages, five of the terrorists and a West German policeman lost their lives.\r Born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm in 1913 in the north German city of Lubeck, he adopted the pseudonym Willy Brandt when he left Germany for Norway in 1934 to escape Nazi persecution.

Henry's reign lasted somewhat longer than Adrian's -- 35 years until his death at the age of 56 in 1189 matched the longest reigns in English history at the time -- Aethelred (978-1013) and Henry I (1100-1135). \n"}, {"text": "The Battle of Vimy Ridge, one of the best-remembered events in Canadian military history, was part of the Battle of Arras, fought in northern France.

The war lasted three years and culminated with The Treaty of Nanking which left Britain in control of Hong Kong.
