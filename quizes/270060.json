{"id": "270060", "name": "\"Twilight Princess\" Equippable Items Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Who gives Link the Fishing Rod in Ordon Village?", "correct": "Uli", "options": ["Pergie", "Rusl", "Mayor Bo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUli.\n\n\tIn exchange for a brand new bassinet (found on a pinnacle in the middle of the river and attainable with the use of a hawk), Uli will hand over a Fishing Rod made by her son, Colin.  The Fishing Rod will help you continue through the first stages of the game as you use it to catch a fish and ultimately earn your Slingshot.  You also use this equippable in other areas, particularly in Lanayru Province in order to catch the Reekfish and participate in the fishing challenges on Zora's River. \n"}, {"text": "Which item allows you to cross the poisonous mists that later cover parts of the Faron Woods?", "correct": "Lantern", "options": ["Ordon Sword", "Slingshot", "Wooden Sword"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLantern.\n\n\tThis mist oddly falls to the lower regions of the forest after the twilight is banished from the area, but you'll get the Lantern long before this happens.  During your first visit to the area, you can meet Coro outside his forest hut and get the Lantern for free, and it'll be full of Lantern Oil!  You can use this Lantern to light the way through dark caverns, set braziers ablaze, and other odd things.  The oil that is used to keep the object alight can be held in any spare bottles and it can be found throughout the game in the form of yellow Chus. \n"}, {"text": "The Ordon Shield is given to you by Rusl.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhen Twilight falls in Faron Woods and Link is transformed into a wolf, the Bulblin warriors will take the children of Ordon Village and drop them off in Kakariko Village.  To revert back to your original form, you will first need to obtain a sword and a shield for Midna, and both can be found in the village.  The Ordon Shield is in Jaggle and Pergies' house while the Ordon Sword can be found in Rusl and Uli's if you dig through their wall. \n"}, {"text": "Which spirit gives Link the Hero's Clothes?", "correct": "Faron", "options": ["Ordona", "Lanayru", "Eldin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFaron.\n\n\tAfter you fill the Vessel of Light in Faron Woods with sixteen different Twilit Parasites, you'll receive the Hero's Clothes from the spirit of Faron (who is in the form of a monkey).  The Hero's Clothes are a staple in the \"Legend of Zelda\" series as Link has the outfit in nearly every title.  The other spirits around Hyrule do not give you gifts that can be used throughout the game. \n"}, {"text": "Link needs Iron Boots in order to defeat which foes?", "correct": "Gorons", "options": ["Armos", "Redeads", "Zoras"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGorons.\n\n\tWhen you reach the point in the game where you need to ascend Death Mountain, your path will be constantly blocked by furious Gorons who seem like boorish, but overwhelmingly friendly rock creatures in other games.  To get past them, you need to return to Ordon Village and fight Mayor Bo for the Iron Boots in a wrestling match.  When you reach the top of the mountain, you'll need to fight Gor Coron in the same way.  The Iron Boots also help you navigate the Goron Mines (with large magnets) and they help you enter and cross other dungeons and temples. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Link obtain the Zora Armor?", "correct": "Kakariko Graveyard", "options": ["Zora's Domain", "Hyrule Castle Town", "Ordon Village"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKakariko Graveyard.\n\n\tIn order to have this armor bestowed upon you, you will need to help Telma and Ilia escort Prince Ralis, the gravely ill Zora prince to Kakariko Village where Renado will use his shaman powers to heal and protect the character.  Once this is done, the spirit of Queen Rutela will lead Link to the graveyard next to Kakariko Village and show him to a spring under the grave of the Zora King.  This armor will allow you to swim easier, but if you wear it and take fire or ice damage, you'll be hit for triple the amount and get hurt much more than usual. \n"}, {"text": "What optional equippable item allows Link to view objects from far away and snipe out enemies with his Hero's Bow?", "correct": "Hawkeye", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkeye.\n\n\tThe Hawkeye isn't necessarily needed in the game, but it's quite nice to have as it will allow you to effectively defeat enemies from a distance with the Bow and Arrow (or Bow and Bomb/Arrow combo).  To get this, you simply need to purchase if from Malo's Kakariko Village shop (Malo Mart) after you've taken the Hero's Bow with you on your way out of the Goron Mines.  After all, what use is the item without something to use it with? \n"}, {"text": "What does the Magic Armor deplete during its use?", "correct": "Rupees", "options": ["Magic power", "Bombs", "Arrows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRupees.\n\n\tThe Magic Armor in \"Twilight Princess\" is quite similar to the same object in \"Wind Waker\" (for the Gamecube) as both make Link much better protected in a world of evil foes.  However, both come at a price.  In \"Wind Waker\", that price is paid through magic power, but since \"Twilight Princess\" features no such thing, you'll be paying a hefty price from your wallet in order to make use of the item. As well, once Malo buys out his location in Hyrule Castle Town, the lowest price you can get for the armor is a sum of 598 Rupees.  It's up to you to decide if the item is feasible or not considering that every time you come into contact with the item, it costs you. \n"}, {"text": "In which dungeon can one find the Spinner?", "correct": "Arbiter's Grounds", "options": ["Lakebed Temple", "City in the Sky", "Snowpeak Temple"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArbiter's Grounds.\n\n\tThe Spinner is a unique, new item in the \"Zelda\" series that allows the player to follow tracks embedded in walls in order to access new areas.  The Spinner itself is a platform supported by a spinning bottom that allows Link to hover over dangerous areas until it comes to a stop.  Because of its powerful spin, it can also be used to harm enemies, and Link can also jump the pre-designed tracks from one to another if it's convenient.  There are numerous tracks around Hyrule Field to be accessed and explored. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the object needed to bring life to the Armos Statues in the Temple of Time?", "correct": "Dominion Rod & The Dominion Rod", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDominion Rod & The Dominion Rod.\n\n\tThe Dominion Rod is obtained after completing the battle against Darknut in the highest room of the Temple of Time (in the past).  This rod can be used to bring life to ancient statues around Hyrule including the Armos statues throughout that very temple to the owl statues in the present which guard the Ancient Sky Book Characters, six of which are scattered around Hyrule and which are needed in order for Link to access the canyon in Kakariko Village.  This ultimately gets you to the City in the Sky. \n"}]}
