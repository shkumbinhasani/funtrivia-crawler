It had a solid white cover, and was released by which famous band?", "correct": "The Beatles", "options": ["The Rolling Stones", "The Who", "The Monkees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Beatles.\n\n\tThe Beatles released \"The White Album\" in 1968.  The real title of the album is \"The Beatles\", but it is referred to as \"The White Album\" more often than not, simply due to it being completely white.  \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked the album number 10 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \n"}, {"text": "This band released an album that was self-titled, but is often known as \"The Black Album\".  The only thing on the cover is a cobra in the bottom right corner, in a dark gray color.  The rest is entirely black.  What heavy metal band released this album?", "correct": "Metallica", "options": ["Black Sabbath", "Slipknot", "Cobra Starship"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMetallica.\n\n\tMetallica released their album \"Metallica\" in 1991.  It was their fifth album.  It is often referred to as \"The Black Album\" for much the same reason the Beatles' \"White Album\" is called the \"White Album\".  It is simply because the cover is black.  Songs off this album include \"Enter Sandman\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", and \"The Unforgiven\". \n"}, {"text": "Yet another self-titled album is often known as \"The Green Album\" because of it's bright color.  The album is neon green, but features the band in the middle.  What band released this album?", "correct": "Weezer", "options": ["Linkin Park", "Hanson", "Green Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWeezer.\n\n\tWeezer's third album was released in 2001, and was simply called \"Weezer\".  However, because the album cover is a lime-green or neon green in color, with the band displayed on it, it is often called the \"Green Album\".  Songs on the album include \"Island in the Sun\" and \"Photograph\".  Weezer also has two other self-titled albums, one of which is referred to as \"The Blue Album\" and the other that is called \"The Red Album\". \n"}, {"text": "A British electronica band released \"The Blue Album\" in 2004.

It contained the hit \"The Perfect Sunrise\".  It was their seventh album.  Orbital's first album, self-titled, was released in 1991, and is often called \"The Green Album\", as it is green with a lighter green atomic symbol on the cover.  Their second album was called \"Orbital 2\", and was released in 1993.  However, because it is a solid brown color with an atomic symbol on it, it is often referred to as \"The Brown Album\". \n"}, {"text": "A mash-up album was released by this singer, which was titled \"The Grey Album\".  It included a cappella versions of Jay-Z's \"Black Album\" as well as some samples from the Beatles' \"White Album\", which, when combined onto one album, apparently gives you a \"Grey Album\".  Who released this album?", "correct": "Danger Mouse", "options": ["Mickey Mouse", "Speedy Gonzales", "Mighty Mouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDanger Mouse.\n\n\t\"The Grey Album\" was released by Brian Joseph Burton in 2004.  Burton is better known by his stage name \"Danger Mouse\".  Just as the name suggests, the cover of the album is solid gray, except for the name \"Danger Mouse\" written in the bottom right corner in both black and white. \n"}, {"text": "It may not be a solid colored album, but this band released an album called \"The Purple Album\".

The cover design is of an orange stage with orange lights in the background, with the band standing proudly, the lights behind them making them look more like silhouettes than actual people.  Their song \"Chelsea\", sampled the song \"Sweet Dreams\" by the Eurythmics.  The song is much different from the Summer Set's hit of the same name. \n"}, {"text": "Many television shows include music in some of their episodes, and this show is no exception.  In fact, this popular cartoon released several albums including the music sung by the characters from the show.  What show had the album called \"The Yellow Album\"?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["Family Guy", "Robot Chicken", "Aqua Teen Hunger Force"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\t\"The Simpsons\" is a long-running prime time adult cartoon that has also released a few albums.

Some of the characters, including Bart, Lisa, Homer, and even Apu, sing songs on the album.  The cover of the album is not solid yellow, but has a bunch of the \"Simpsons\" characters on it, including minor characters and even a Homer Buddha.\rPerhaps a better choice would have been Spongebob Squarepants' \"Yellow Album\", which is actually solid yellow. \n"}, {"text": "This band's hit \"Pinch Me\" was released on a colorful album, which was called \"The Maroon Album\".  Rather, it was simply called \"Maroon\".  Which revealing band released this album?", "correct": "Barenaked Ladies", "options": ["Nitty Gritty Dirt Band", "Naked Brother's Band", "Chumbawamba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarenaked Ladies.\n\n\tThe Barenaked Ladies released their fifth album in 2000.  It was called \"Maroon\", or \"The Maroon Album\".  It contained three hit singles, including \"Pinch Me\", \"Too Little Too Late\" (not the same as the Jojo song of the same name), and \"Falling For the First Time\".  The Barenaked Ladies are known for their fast paced lyrics as well as their humor, which are both present in their hit songs \"One Week\" and \"If I Had A Million Dollars\" (also titled \"If I Had $1000000\" or simply \"$1,000,000\").  The album \"Maroon\" is not at all solid maroon. It contains an eye, a man with very long and skinny legs, red carpet, and constellations. \n"}, {"text": "The second album by this band was called \"The Platinum Album\".
