The current building is actually the third incarnation on the same sit -- the first two were destroyed by fire, in 1808 and 1857. \rThe alternatives are three more iconic London locations: Smithfield is the home of London's historic meat market, and there has been a market on this site since the 10th Century; Drury Lane borders Covent Garden to the east and is the location of numerous famous theaters as well the first Sainsbury's store, opened in 1869; Fleet Street is the historic location for the newspaper industry, and although the last of the news offices left here in 2005 'Fleet Street' is still used to mean the 'national press'. \n"}, {"text": "The last of the Apollo missions to the Moon, Apollo 17, was launched on this date in 1972.

The other two members of the team were Command Module Pilot Ronald Ellwin Evans, Jr., a former captain in the US Navy and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Hagan \"Jack\" Schmitt. Schmitt became the twelfth and the last man (in the 20th century) to walk on the Moon, but at the end of the mission he re-entered the Lunar Module first, making Cernan the last man on the surface. Schmitt, who would later go on to represent New Mexico in the US Senate, is also the only man to walk on the Moon who had never served in the military. (He was not the only civilian, though, since Neil Armstrong's military career had ended before his historic visit in 1969, so technically he was a civilian at the time.) \rThe alternatives all flew in earlier flights: John Young, Thomas Mattingly II and Charles Duke jr flew aboard Apollo 16; David Scott, Alfred Worden and James Irwin crewed Apollo 15; whilst Charles \"Pete\" Conrad jr, Richard Gordon jr and Alan Bean visit the Moon aboard Apollo 12. \n"}, {"text": "Which outlaw committed his first confirmed bank robbery in Gallatin, Missouri on December 7, 1869?", "correct": "Jesse James", "options": ["John Dillinger", "Butch Cassidy", "Clyde Barrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJesse James.\n\n\tBorn in Kearney MO in 1847, Jesse James and his James Younger Gang were responsible for numerous robberies, holdups and killings across the Midwest states in the years following the US Civil War.
