{"id": "191663", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Requiem for a Lightweight' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "With all shifts heading to the O.R. for yet another shipment of wounded boys, the M*A*S*H 4077th is excited into near chaos.  Calmly, Hawkeye and Trapper walk amongst the pandemonium towards the hospital tent, that is, until they encounter a toweled Nurse Cutler.  Both are immediately smitten by this nurse, played by Marcia Strassman.  In what later television show did Strassman become famous?", "correct": "Welcome Back, Kotter", "options": ["Family Ties", "The Jeffersons", "Cheers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWelcome Back, Kotter.\n\n\tMarcia Strassman played Julie Kotter, wife of Gabe Kotter, a teacher in a Brooklyn high school.  Before her work as Julie Kotter, Strassman made three guest appearances as Nurse Cutler on 'M*A*S*H', one in this episode and two others in the first season, namely: 'Yankee Doodle Doctor' and 'Edwina'.  Fans of the 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' movie series may also recognize Strassman. \n"}, {"text": "During the ensuing operating session, Nurse Cutler proves herself to be a very skilled nurse.  She also appears to be capable in the realm of flirting, captivating both Hawkeye and Trapper.  Margaret, however, is not impressed.  Hot Lips demands that Nurse Cutler report to her office, to which Cutler replies, 'Yes, sir.  I mean, yes, ma'am.'  Hawkeye makes light of this confusion about Margaret's gender, to which Hot Lips responds, 'My sex is none of your business!'  How does Trapper respond to this?", "correct": "Just say the word!", "options": ["No, that's Frank's business.", "When do you open for business?", "I'd love to invest in your business!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJust say the word!.\n\n\t'At least she didn't have any trouble figuring out your sex.' jokes Hawkeye.  'My sex is none of your business!' replies Margaret with annoyance.  Trapper quickly retorts, 'Just say the word!'  Margaret then threatens Hawkeye and Trapper that they should stay away from 'her' nurses, especially Cutler. \n"}, {"text": "Following their encounter with Hot Lips in the mess tent, the two doctors plan secretly to make their way to Nurse Cutler's tent.  Unfortunately they both arrive in tandem at the door to her tent with gifts meant for Cutler.  Trapper carries a small bunch of flowers, but what lovely present does Hawkeye bear?", "correct": "A pair of nylons", "options": ["A book of poetry", "A fake pearl necklace", "A parka for two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pair of nylons.\n\n\tNaturally, both stole the gifts they intend to present to Nurse Cutler.  On his way to her tent, Hawkeye takes the pair of nylons off of a clothesline, most likely Margaret's.  Trapper plucks the flowers from a small garden that Frank has been nurturing.  This marks the garden's only appearance. \n"}, {"text": "Back in Henry's office, the oblivious Colonel is cajoled into signing blank papers from Radar, and subsequently receives a phone call from a certain general regarding a boxing tournament.  What is the name of the General, played by Sorrell Booke?", "correct": "General Barker", "options": ["General Clayton", "General Hammond", "General Steele"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Barker.\n\n\tGeneral Bradley Barker is portrayed in this episode (and in 'Chief Surgeon, Who?') of 'M*A*S*H' by Sorrell Booke, who you may better remember as Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg from the television series 'The Dukes of Hazzard'.  In this episode, General Barker has arranged a boxing tournament and convinces Henry to enter one of his men into the ring. \n"}, {"text": "Following Henry's phone call with the General, Hawkeye and Trapper barge into his office to confront Henry.  It seems that Margaret has decided to transfer Nurse Cutler, and the boys want Henry to countermand this order.  When friendly requests don't work, what threat does Trapper launch against Henry?", "correct": "He'll tell everyone that Henry's brother is in jail", "options": ["He'll send photos of Henry's girlfriend home to his wife", "He'll reveal that Henry received his command on a bribe", "He'll starch all of Henry's underwear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe'll tell everyone that Henry's brother is in jail.\n\n\tWhen Hawkeye and Trapper enter Henry's office, he anticipates trouble and greets them as 'Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Jekyll'.  Sure enough, Trapper and Hawkeye are up to their usual shenanigans, hoping to have Henry overturn Margaret's transfer order.  When Henry refuses to budge, Trapper lodges this threat, 'If you say no we'll tell everybody your brother's in jail!'  Henry responds, 'My brother is a warden!'  Hawkeye quickly follows, 'We won't say that part'. \n"}, {"text": "Henry suggests that the only way he will rescind Nurse Cutler's transfer order is if either Trapper or Hawkeye agree to participate in an upcoming intra-unit boxing tournament.  The doctors balk at Henry's suggestion, laughing off the idea as they walk out of Henry's office.  Eventually, however, Trapper agrees to go through with the competition if it means keeping Nurse Cutler at the camp.  Has Trapper any boxing experience?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tTrapper claims to have boxed in college, as does Hawkeye.  Hawkeye professes to have a bad shoulder, however, and hence cannot box.  This leaves Trapper who 'fought in school'.  When Trapper insists that he is not in shape, Hawkeye responds, 'Who says you're not in shape.  You've got a cute body.  I've seen guys sneaking peaks at you in calisthenics.'  'Who's sneaking peaks at me in calisthenics?' Trapper asks, with great concern.  'I'd rather not say.  Some of them are married.' Hawkeye responds. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper begins sparring immediately following his agreement to box in the tournament.  With which of these M*A*S*H dwellers does Trapper take a turn in the practice ring?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Klinger", "Father Mulcahy", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar and Trapper dance about the ring, trading one ineffectual jab after another.  Radar does land one inadvertant punch right square in Trapper's gut, prompting the erstwhile college pugilist's knees to buckle.  Hawkeye is horrified, accusing Trapper of having a 'glass stomach'.  When Hawkeye turns to Father Mulcahy for advice, the good Father responds, 'Prayer--I don't think he's got one.'  This, by the way, marks the first appearance of William Christopher on the show. \n"}, {"text": "Following Trapper's brief training session, the boys settle into the Swamp for a lovely martini.  Radar arrives with some disturbing news.  He has seen Trapper's opponent, a man he suggests could be an entire platoon.  Hawkeye decides at this point that a fair fight is a bad idea, and he concocts a clever plan, they will douse Trapper's boxing glove with ether.  Which M*A*S*H-ite demonstrates the effectiveness of this ether solution by making himself pass out?", "correct": "Ugly John", "options": ["Spearchucker", "Hawkeye", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUgly John.\n\n\tUgly John administers the ether onto Trapper's boxing gloves, and then physically instructs Trapper on how to keep the glove in his opponent's face.  In the process, Ugly John effectively knocks himself out!  In real life, unfortunately, this would be an unlikely solution.  Ether evaporates too easily and a very heavy dose concentrated over a person's nose and/or mouth would be required to cause a person to pass out. \n"}, {"text": "Entering the ring near the end of the episode we have Trapper in one corner and his opponent in the other.  Trapper's opponent, Sergeant Flacker, has the word 'Killer' printed on his boxing robe.  What word(s) is/are taped to Trapper's robe?", "correct": "Kid Doctor", "options": ["M*A*S*H Mauler", "Sugar Ray Trapper", "Surgical Slammer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKid Doctor.\n\n\tTrapper's opponent has 'knocked out a jeep', according to Radar.  Trapper and Hawkeye witness him battering a punching bag prior to the fight, this prompting Hawkeye's little plan.  Unbenownst to the two scheming doctors, Frank and Margaret have switched the ether with plain water (the smell would give it away, I'm afraid) thinking they will ruin Hawkeye's plan. \n"}, {"text": "Trapper manages to finally overcome his opponent through perseverance and a little ether.  By the end of the episode, Nurse Cutler has been allowed to remain at the 4077th and chooses which of the following outcomes?", "correct": "She chooses Trapper", "options": ["She spurns both doctors", "She chooses Hawkeye", "There is no apparent decision, she walks arm in arm with both doctors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe chooses Trapper.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to the two scheming doctors, Frank and Margaret switch the ether with plain water (the smell gives it away to Hawkeye) thinking they will ruin Hawkeye's plan.  Hawkeye is able to retrieve some ether just in time to save Trapper and put Flacker's lights out.  In the end, Trapper reaps the benefits of his effort, getting the girl and a nice piece of steak to cool his aching head.\r Thank you for playing.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz and will try more of my 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
