He offers Kai a drink to celebrate his recent political win, but Kai refuses, staying he needs to stay alert for his men.  The two of them discuss Ally's deranged intervention at the rally, and Dr. Vincent says that while he initially stepped back from Kai's whole scheme, because he was ashamed, he's now more interested in helping.\rAt The Butchery on Main, Ivy serves Kai's men as they complain about their meals.  Kai has asked that they eat healthy, but the men are more interested in being sexist.  Ivy later refers to them as 'dudebros with too much time on their hands'. \n"}, {"text": "During a city council meeting, Kai passed a motion increasing which of these?", "correct": "Presence of private security", "options": ["Taxes on firearms", "Further video surveillance mesaures", "Parking fines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPresence of private security.\n\n\tAs it turns out, Ivy, Winter, and Beverly are all working at the Butchery on Main, working to provide healthy meals to Kai's men and seething while they do it.  No less than a couple of days earlier they dreamed of toppling the patriarchy, and within a short amount of time, as Ivy says, things turned into 'The Handmaid's Tale'.  Beverly says that no one else saw the city council meeting from the previous night though, and there, Kai strong armed the city council into allowing his men to act as private security. Winter suggests they let Kai follow through on the master plan, but Beverly says they need to cut the head off the snake, even if he's Winter's older brother. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Kai and Winter find themselves contacted by Pastor Charles?", "correct": "The Dark Web", "options": ["A coffee shop", "An unmarked payphone", "Via a mailed letter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dark Web.\n\n\tWinter is a bit more hesitant to attack her brother.  Back in October 2015, the two of them were online trolling social justice warriors in the dark web when they received a message from a user named PastorCharles inviting them to Judgment House, a farmhouse near Wixom, Michigan.  They went, despite Winter's reservations, and were greeted by a man claiming to be a 'watchman'.  This proved to be one of the most frightening and affecting experiences they would have together. \n"}, {"text": "How many people did Kai and Winter save from Judgment House?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Four", "None", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tHeading into the locked rooms of Judgment House, Kai and Winter were greeted by people being tortured for their sins, begging to be freed from the house they'd seemingly been trapped in.  One woman, strapped into stirrups, begged to be let go; Kai found she was covered in real blood.  A man in the next room, hooked up to numerous IVs, was being drugged from the inside out. In the next, a man strapped to a chair begged for help; as soon as Pastor Charles stopped talking, knives would impale him from the back of the chair.  Kai sent Winter to go get help while he freed the others from the traps.  They captured the 'Pastor', tied him to his own torture device, and did what was right by killing him. Winter admits Kai changed since then, but he's lost his way and they can bring him back to rightness.  Winter says she'll go to him because he'll listen to her, and Beverly says that she has a week to change things. \n"}, {"text": "According to Kai, who will be the mother of their organization's messiah?", "correct": "Winter", "options": ["Ally", "Ivy", "Beverly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinter.\n\n\tWinter heads to Kai to discuss the concerns the women of the cult have and he asks her to sit at the table to perform their pinky promise.  He asks if she loves him and will always be honest with him, but she says he makes it hard.  He needs to have her in the bigger picture though, and with that he breaks their vow and pulls his pinky away. He says that he loves the family they're going to make because she will be the one to bring their messiah into their world to proliferate their message through the generations.  He admits that he will not be incestuous, but he will work through Detective Samuels, the instrument of their union. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Dr. Vincent send Ally for three weeks?", "correct": "A psych ward", "options": ["Florida", "Prison", "A wellness retreat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA psych ward.\n\n\tDr. Vincent visits Ally at her house to discuss why he put her in a psych ward for three weeks and the situation soon turns to a declaration of brutal honesty.  Dr. Vincent reveals to her that he's Kai's brother, and together, she and him need to find a way to stop him from using his power to do worse things. During this time, Ally also learns that Winter, Oz's nanny, is also related to the two of them, only complicating things further.  That's when it all clicks; she realizes that Kai must've gotten all of his information about her from the office's case files.  Despite Ally's reluctance, Dr. Vincent says that they will need to do something and he will get her back together with her son if it's the last thing he does. \n"}, {"text": "What meal does Ally cook up for Kai?", "correct": "Sloppy Joes", "options": ["Steak and eggs", "Spaghetti", "Liver and onions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSloppy Joes.\n\n\tThings get awkward in the evening when Winter and Detective Samuels, both in robes, are met by Kai in the basement to conceive a messiah.  After Kai turns on All-4-One's \"I Swear\", he lays out the plan and urges them to get to work.  Fortunately, Winter isn't having any of it; she finds the whole idea to be ludicrous and calls Kai out on his plan.\rAt home, Ally cries over her lost family and goes about her day until there's a knocking at her door.  It's Kai, and she specifically invited him over for sloppy joes.  She asks that he send his guards outside for a moment (which he does) and they talk seriously.  She wants her son, and for that she'll give him some information. \n"}, {"text": "As penance for defying Kai, Winter is told to do which of these?", "correct": "Litter", "options": ["Kill", "Spy", "Run"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLitter.\n\n\tAlly gives the information: Dr. Vincent is planning to have Kai committed.  He doesn't want his name and reputation to be dragged down by whatever Kai plans to do.  She also says that she's not really afraid of what Kai might plan to do to her if he doesn't believe her, partly because she's not really afraid of anything anymore.  Unlike Dr. Vincent, and Ivy, and all the medication, Kai may have cured her of everything she was afraid of before.\rWinter, meanwhile, is stuck performing her penance.  Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and dunce cap, she's been told to return recycling to the city streets because Kai thinks the trash should be where it belongs (and he doesn't believe in global warming).  Detective Samuels brings her some lunch and she asks him for something better.  He doesn't give it though, and she wonders if he was always such a lapdog. \n"}, {"text": "Winter single-handedly murders which fellow cult member?", "correct": "Detective Samuels", "options": ["Beverly", "Gary", "Ivy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDetective Samuels.\n\n\tDetective Samuels first met Kai when he was giving away fake prescriptions in an alley in town.  Samuels punched Kai out and blackmailed him instead of taking him to prison for using his brother's prescriptions, taking 70% of the cut.  When Kai dropped the money off at Samuels' house though, he got some blackmail of his own to bargain with, stumbling across Samuels in a compromising position and exploiting him to the fullest using his cunning and persuasive words. Winter insults him and, enraged, he attacks her.  Fortunately though, she has a gun, and after telling Samuels that it's too late for either of them, she shoots him in the head. \n"}, {"text": "Kai, in front of his followers, murders both his brother and Beverly.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKai asks his underlings to bring the betrayers to him, and they place Dr. Vincent and Beverly before him, allowing others to don their masks.  Kai speaks to his brother first, confirming that his own flesh and blood tried to have him locked up.  In front of everyone else, Kai and Dr. Vincent share a pinky promise, but only until Kai cuts off his brother's finger.  As Winter screams in horror, Kai plunges the knife into Rudy's neck and tells his men to take him out of his sight.\rAnd then it's time to talk to Beverly.  Kai says that she needs to pay for what she did to Detective Samuels and reminds her that winter told the truth-- that Beverly shot Samuels and said Kai would be next.  Beverly denies it, with reason, and criticizes Kai's leadership before he places her into isolation, claiming death would be too good for her.\rAfter this, Kai welcomes the newest member to their collective.  The woman wearing Beverly's clown outfit removes her mask and reveals herself to be Ally. \n"}]}
