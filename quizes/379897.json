Which of the following ingredients differentiates she-crab soup from other seafood soups?", "correct": "Crab roe", "options": ["Champagne", "Powdered shell", "It has no crab in it!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrab roe.\n\n\tShe-crab soup is a wonderfully smooth and silky seafood bisque-like soup made with Atlantic blue crab meat enhanced by the addition of a quantity of the crab roe.  The broth itself consists of milk and cream flavoured with a small quantity of sherry and is often thickened by adding a puree made from boiled rice.

This makes no difference to me personally; I don't mind offal such as liver and kidneys but I do draw the line at tripe! \n"}, {"text": "This is a thin soup that originates in the far eastern country of China.
