{"id": "407248", "name": "Road Blocks of \"The Amazing Race 29\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Amazing Race", "Amazing Race 29"], "questions": [{"text": "The race's first Road Block involved window washing in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.  Who completed this task of those listed?", "correct": "Shamir", "options": ["Michael", "Brooke", "Vanck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShamir.\n\n\tAlthough it took him nearly half a dozen attempts, rappelling down the side of the Instituto Cervantes S\u00e3o Paulo and heading back to the top to try again, Shamir was amongst the ten racers who were selected to take part in the race's first Road Block at the end of Leg 2.  For this task, Ashton, Liz, Redmond, Seth, Scott, Shamir, Becca, Tara, Logan, and Francesca had to rappel down the building and wash a marked window to the satisfaction of the building's cleaning crew. If they failed to complete the task they would need to drop to the bottom, take the elevator to the top, and strap in for another attempt. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 3, teams visited Stone Town's Darajani Market, where they bought which of these for a local family?", "correct": "Food", "options": ["School supplies", "Car parts", "Furniture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFood.\n\n\tHeading to the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania in Leg 3, teams reached their Road Block near the end of their day, stopping in at the busy, labyrinthine Darajani Market to pick up a shopping list of eighteen items, most of which were written in Swahili.  In addition to needing to sort through the ingredients, the selected team members (Joey, Michael, Vanck, Floyd, London, Brooke, Matt, Sara, and Olive) had to spend their own money from that which they still had accumulated.  If they got all the items, including a prepared halal chicken, they could get their next clue. \n"}, {"text": "The fourth leg of the race saw teams creating ladle strainers from scratch in a Tanzanian metalworking shop.  Which racer completed the task?", "correct": "Brooke", "options": ["London", "Tara", "Ashton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrooke.\n\n\tNotably, Brooke received help from several other racers in order to complete the task, even closing out debts put on other teams to get through the tough challenge.  In Dar es Salaam, team members went metalworking, creating a ladle strainer with nothing more than sheets of aluminum to get a clue that would take them to the next Pit Stop.  Becca, Vanck, Joey, Michael, Redmond, Logan, and Brooke completed this task once their ladles were put to use.  Shamir was also selected for this task, but he and Sara were eliminated partway through the challenge. \n"}, {"text": "Which team didn't complete the Road Block task in Norway in Leg 5?", "correct": "Becca and Floyd", "options": ["Brooke and Scott", "Matt and Redmond", "Vanck and Ashton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecca and Floyd.\n\n\tThe only reason they didn't was because they instead completed the Fast Forward task, allowing them to skip both the Road Block and the Detour before checking into the fifth Pit Stop.  It would have been right up Becca's alley as a mountain climber though since team members needed to head to the town of Slinningen and climb up the side of a hand-made bonfire tower to help build the structure.  Matt, Joey, Ashton, Scott, London, and Liz completed this task and headed off a week before it was set ablaze, setting a world record. \n"}, {"text": "In Leg 6, team members took a tram ride through the city of Milan.  They needed to find three words along the route.  Which was not one of them?", "correct": "Tremezzo", "options": ["Lago", "Cernobbio", "Concordia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTremezzo.\n\n\tVisiting the city of Milan for a late evening meal, racers had to hop aboard a streetcar restaurant and search for three marked Italian words that they could trade for their next clue.  The catch was that, in addition to keeping their eyes peeled, the participants had to complete a plate of parmigiana melanzane and a bowl of gnocchi.  Should they fail to get all three words or finish their meal, they would need to go to the back of the line and start everything-- the ride and the meal-- over again.  Ultimately, the clue would lead them to Lake Como, north of the city. \n"}, {"text": "During the Road Block in Venice in Leg 7, teams had to paint which of the following?", "correct": "Masks", "options": ["Glass", "Canvases", "People"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMasks.\n\n\tVisiting Ca'Zenobio near the end of Leg 7, team members were faced with a challenge that allowed them to engage with one of Venice's many unique art features, the masquerade mask.  Choosing an existing mask, selected team members (Redmond, Tara, Floyd, Liz, London, and Brooke) had to properly paint to match an example using the technique demonstrated to them by a master mask-maker.  If they could mimic their exemplar, they could get their next clue and head to the Pit Stop. \n"}, {"text": "Teams completed a Changing of the Guard for the Road Block in Leg 8, but in what European capital?", "correct": "Athens", "options": ["Sarajevo", "Belgrade", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAthens.\n\n\tCutting across Greece in the eighth leg of the race, the final six teams eventually arrived in Athens, the capital of the country, where they completed tasks at a number of ancient landmarks.  Arriving at the Zappeion, six team members went solo for the Road Block and learned the choreography of the traditional Changing of the Guard normally performed at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  If they could master the steps, they could head to the Pit Stop.  This task was done by Tara, Matt, Brooke, London, Becca and Liz. \n"}, {"text": "A bungee jump awaited team members completing the Road Block in Leg 9.  Did any teams opt out and take a penalty instead?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough many participants had a hard time coming to terms with this difficult challenge, five racers took the plunge in this Switchback task originally seen during the race's last visit to Greece in season 9.  Joey, Matt, Scott, Logan, and Becca jumped 240 feet to collect their next clue sending them across Asia to Hanoi, Vietnam. Teams were informed this season that, coming out of the ninth leg of the race, both team members needed to have equal Road Block distribution.  This meant that, besides Becca and Floyd, who completed the Fast Forward in Leg 5, four racers were specifically required to participate in this task. \n"}, {"text": "Which racer was last to finish the shrimp trap Road Block in Ninh B\u00ecnh in Leg 10?", "correct": "Floyd", "options": ["Joey", "Matt", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFloyd.\n\n\tThe tenth leg of the race, held in the overwhelmingly hot, but overwhelmingly beautiful limestone cliffs of Ninh B\u00ecnh, Vietnam, proved to be a tough one for all teams, but the Road Block was a deciding moment for Becca and Floyd.  Revisiting a tough challenge from the race's third season in an \"Amazing Race\" Switchback, team members had to (over)load a bike with thirty-two bundles of shrimp traps and deliver them a mile away. If team members dropped their traps they would have to retrieve them to finish.  Unfortunately, Floyd was nearly unable to complete the task, failing to bring all the traps to the finish line twice and, following the challenge, succumbing to heat exhaustion. \n"}, {"text": "Leg 11 was the last leg of the race to feature a Road Block (it contained two!).  Teams completing the first of these had to join in which unique activity?", "correct": "Cup-stacking", "options": ["Robot soccer", "Speed-golfing", "'Gangnam Style' dancing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCup-stacking.\n\n\tVisiting the Hanyang University Olympic Gymnasium in Leg 11, teams faced the first of two Road Blocks in Leg 11 when they came face-to-face with sport stacking.  With only seven seconds on the clock, team members had to stack three pyramids of cups and disassemble them properly to get their next clue.  The other team member encountered the Road Block later in the leg at the OGN e-Stadium where they were required to win a round of \"Street Fighter V\" against an esports pro.  To make it easier, after a set amount of rounds, the pro would be blindfolded with a hand tied behind their back. \n"}]}
