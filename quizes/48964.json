{"id": "48964", "name": "Overrated Movies Online Quiz | Classic Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Classic Movies", "Classics - Average 10"], "questions": [{"text": "'To Kill A Mockingbird'. Who had a cameo appearance at the end?", "correct": "Robert Duvall", "options": ["Dana Andrews", "Richared Dreyfus", "Montgomery Clift"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Duvall.\n\n\tThis is considered to be one of the greatest of American films. Yet, those kids are annoying ... and Duvall at the end - I don't see what makes it so special. \n"}, {"text": "'Terms of Endearment'. Who was the star?", "correct": "Shirley Maclaine", "options": ["Mary Tyler Moore", "Julie Andrews", "Candice Bergen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShirley Maclaine.\n\n\tA solid 75 minutes of dull opening, with Nicholson and Maclaine doing their off-the wall characters. Then, because someone becomes ill, it somehow gets to be a 'classic' tear-jerker? I don't think so. (speaking of Maclaine, I might also mention 'Turning Point'.) \n"}, {"text": "'Touch of Evil'. The first name that comes to mind is Orson Welles, but who was the leading man in the movie?", "correct": "Charlton Heston", "options": ["Dick Powell", "Van Johnson", "Jeff Chandler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharlton Heston.\n\n\tI don't see anything outstanding or extraordinary here. (Or in 'The Third Man'.) \n"}, {"text": "'Ryan's Daughter'. Who played the title role?", "correct": "Sarah Miles", "options": ["Janet Leigh", "Elizabeth Ashley", "Sue Lyon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah Miles.\n\n\tYes, it's a sweeping David Lean panorama ... but this is a long, slow movie that doesn't go anywhere. \n"}, {"text": "'Murder on the Orient Express'. Who played the victim?", "correct": "Richard Widmark", "options": ["Lauren Bacall", "Albert Finney", "Ingrid Bergman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Widmark.\n\n\tComic book characters - and a ludicrous ending. \n"}, {"text": "'Saving Private Ryan'. Who played Ryan?", "correct": "Matt Damon", "options": ["George Clooney", "Tom Hanks", "Ben Affleck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Damon.\n\n\tDoes a long opening of blood-and-guts make a movie great? I don't think so. Other than that, a routine movie. \n"}, {"text": "'The Last Tango in Paris'. The star?", "correct": "Marlon Brando", "options": ["Peter Sellers", "Marcello Mastroianni", "Warren Beatty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarlon Brando.\n\n\t'Erotic masterpiece'? No, just dull. (Speaking of Brando, how about 'A Streetcar Named Desire'?) \n"}, {"text": "'The Crying Game'. What did the movie's 'big surprise' involve?", "correct": "Sex", "options": ["Money", "Power", "Fame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSex.\n\n\tOn all the 'ten best' lists for its year. Why? Critics liked it - did anyone else? (On the subject of foreign movies, I might also toss in 'Blow-Up' and 'Juliet of the Spirits'.) \n"}, {"text": "'Bus Stop'. A star-making vehicle for what actress?", "correct": "Marilyn Monroe", "options": ["Lana Turner", "Rhonda Fleming", "Jane Russell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarilyn Monroe.\n\n\tCorny stuff. \n"}, {"text": "'The Wild Bunch'. Director?", "correct": "Sam Peckinpah", "options": ["John Ford", "Howard Hawks", "Michael Curtiz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam Peckinpah.\n\n\tTough sledding. (I also considered 'Americanization of Emily' and 'Anatomy of a Murder' for this last spot.) \n"}]}
