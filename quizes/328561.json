{"id": "328561", "name": "\"Paper Mario\" (N64) - Chapter 3 Trivia Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Paper Mario", "Paper Mario (N64)"], "questions": [{"text": "The guard on what end of Toad Town claims to have seen a ghost?", "correct": "East", "options": ["South", "West", "North"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEast.\n\n\tActing as the breadcrumb for this chapter of the journey, a guard protecting Toad Town from the evils of Forever Forest to the east is frightened out of his wits.  When Mario stops for a chat with him, he doesn't see the ghost making faces behind him, but the guard assures him it's there.  When Mario heads into the dark and spooky woods to investigate, the ghost makes itself seen and invites Mario (as per his master's request) to join them at Boo Mansion on the other side of the woods.  What kind of person would Mario be if he turned them down? \n"}, {"text": "Traveling through Forever Forest, which of these is an enemy encountered by Mario?", "correct": "Piranha Plant", "options": ["Forest Goomba", "Spiny", "Forest Koopa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPiranha Plant.\n\n\tPiranha Plants make their first appearances in the game in this location.  While the plants can chomp at you from their location, they are also capable of burrowing underground and following you to instigate battles.  The only other common enemy found here is the Forest Fuzzy.  While bee-like enemies can be found here as well, they are more commonly associated with a future chapter of the game. As Mario makes his way through the Forever Forest, he'll need to take the words of wisdom of a character seen at the entrance and pay close attention to his surroundings to make it out of the forest properly. On the other end is Boo Mansion. \n"}, {"text": "You'll come across Boo Mansion eventually.  How do you enter this structure?", "correct": "Through the front door", "options": ["Through a side window", "Through a coal chute", "From above- there's a hole in the roof"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThrough the front door.\n\n\tThe Boos are quite welcoming and won't make a fuss when you decide to enter their mansion through the front door.  The place, while grim and dusty, is actually quite welcoming and the Boos inside will not attack.  On the other hand, they're quite the tricksters.  In order to make your way through the mansion you'll need to play they're little games.  This begins with a chain of events beginning with a game played by Boos for a Record.  This can be played in one of the rooms (on a phonograph).  Eventually, you'll move a bookcase to get to the basement. \n"}, {"text": "In the basement of Boo Mansion, which of these can be obtained?", "correct": "Super Boots", "options": ["Ultra Hammer", "Ultra Boots", "Super Hammer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Boots.\n\n\tWhile Mario obtained the Super Hammer in Dry, Dry Ruins in Chapter 2, the Super Boots were the items necessary to continue through Chapter 3.  Once Mario makes his way into the basement, a few more puzzles can be solved before he continues to a room containing a chest.  Although this would normally be the moment where a new item is added to the inventory, there are more Boos inside and they play a game (akin to the one involving the Record) before you can put on the Super Boots.  These shoes allow Mario to do Spin Jumps outside of battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which party member joins Mario's team in this chapter?", "correct": "Bow & Lady Bow", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBow & Lady Bow.\n\n\tTesting the Super Boots, Mario will find that he can unearth secret panels and break wooden boards on the ground using the Spin Jump.  This will open up the remaining portions of Boo Mansion and Mario can find the Boo Portrait in the basement.  This will be the final phase of the puzzles as it will allow Mario to reach the third floor of the house where Lady Bow resides. It was Lady Bow who invite Mario in the first place.  Since she is in possession of the third Star Spirit, she requires that Mario assist her with a great trouble.  She joins the party as the two set out to quell the issues in the area. \n"}, {"text": "The so-called 'Invincible' Tubba Blubba eats Boos.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tLady Bow leads the way to Gusty Gulch to the northeast and Mario is taken past the Gusty Gulch Windmill (Windy Mill) and the local Boo town.  When they pass through, Bow is forced to make Mario invisible using her special powers (when C-down is pressed, Mario can't be seen by enemies) and a citizen of the town is eaten by Tubba Blubba, a large creature who is said to be invincible.  Continuing onwards, Mario will come across Tubba Blubba's Castle, the next dungeon of the game. \n"}, {"text": "In order to get into the Windy Mill, Mario needs which of these?", "correct": "A key", "options": ["An artifact", "A stone", "A new hammer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA key.\n\n\tHeading through Tubba Blubba's Castle, Mario will need to utilize Bow's powers quite frequently to evade alarming enemies who will bring Mario back to the front gate, to avoid spike traps, and to escape from Tubba Blubba himself as he patrols the hallways of his lair.  When Mario reaches the upper-most room of the castle, a bedroom, he will come across a chest moments before the boss waltzes in for a nap. Upon opening the chest, Mario will find a talking key (named Yakkey) who will literally raise the alarm and cause a bit of stress.  Identifying himself as the windmill key (and the key behind the boss' invincibility), Mario will need to bolt through the castle and across Gusty Gulch with Tubba Blubba following the entire time to uncover the truth. \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that Tubba Blubba has a weakness after all.  What is it?", "correct": "His heart", "options": ["His eyes", "His stomach", "His tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis heart.\n\n\tHeading into the depths of the Windy Mill, Mario will find the truth of the matter: Tubba Blubba's Heart has been separated from his body making him 'invincible'.  A battle will begin once Mario enters the final chamber and the heart will charge up a fairly powerful attack every once in a while (luckily, Bow can make you invisible with Outta Sight).  Once you bring down the heart's health to a certain extent, he'll flee to reunite with his body. Luckily, Tubba Blubba will become mortal once more and it is fairly easy to defeat him.  After he is felled, he'll flee the scene and give back the ghosts he ate. Bow will also decide to stay with the group. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Star Spirit found at the end of this chapter?", "correct": "Skolar", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkolar.\n\n\tAfter defeating the not-so-invincible Tubba Blubba, Mario can claim his third Star Spirit of the game, Skolar, who will boost Mario's Star Power meter to three bars and give a new Star Power spell.  This spell, Star Storm, is the first to do actual damage.  Costing two bars of the Star Power meter, Star Storm will cause seven damage to all enemies on the battlefield.  While Tubba Blubba never actually had the Star Spirit, Lady Bow and her Boos kept it for themselves until Mario could rid them of their enemy. \n"}, {"text": "As you depart from Forever Forest, you'll meet up with Jr. Troopa again.  What new power-up does he have this time?", "correct": "Bat wings", "options": ["Magic wand", "Hard shell", "Spiked shell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBat wings.\n\n\tJr. Troopa, who was last seen on Mario's exit from the road leading to Koopa Village, previously sported 15HP and a hard shell to defend from Mario's attacks.  While Jr. Troopa brings along a pair of bat wings this time (hooray, you can't use a hammer now) he also comes back with 40HP, a fair improvement over the last battle.  While he's not too difficult to beat with your most recent arsenal of spells and partners, he's moving up in the world.  It's not your last fight with the poor guy either.\rPrincess Peach and Twink, meanwhile, will discover that Shy Guy's Toy Box is the next place to look out for (wherever it may be) and Peach's responses to Kammy Koopa's questions will determine whether or not Mario has an easy or difficult time at certain points in the dungeon.  Yikes. \n"}]}
