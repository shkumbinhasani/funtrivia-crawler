{"id": "176827", "name": "The Book of Ruth Quiz | Old Testament / Tanakh | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "  Old Testament / Tanakh", " Ruth"], "questions": [{"text": "Who is Ruth's mother-in-law?", "correct": "Naomi", "options": ["Hannah", "Ester", "Janet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNaomi.\n\n\t\"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.\" (Ruth 1:1-4) Naomi was a very loving mother-in-law.We learn throughout the entire book of Ruth that she was the one who stayed loyal to Naomi. Orpah had left her to do her own thing, but Ruth was there through everything. Ruth was without a doubt a woman of integrity.  \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Naomi's other daughter-in-law, besides Ruth?", "correct": "Orpah", "options": ["Anna", "Gladys", "Sarah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrpah.\n\n\tOrpah's husband was Chilion. Orpah believed in many gods and didn't stay with Naomi as Ruth had done. \n"}, {"text": "Why doesn't Ruth want to go with Orpah?", "correct": "She wants to stay with Naomi", "options": ["She doesn't like to travel", "She didn't have a ticket", "She did go with Orpah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe wants to stay with Naomi.\n\n\t\"And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.\" (Ruth 1:16) Perhaps she also didn't want to go with Orpah because Ruth only believes in one God. Orpah and Ruth are very different woman. We hear more about Ruth than Orpah since Orpah leaves, whereas Ruth stays. \n"}, {"text": "What did Naomi say her name should be?", "correct": "Mara", "options": ["Mary", "Martha", "Melissa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMara.\n\n\t\"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.\" (Ruth 1:20) Naomi was a wonderful woman, but like all humans she was not perfect. \n"}, {"text": "Who was a kinsman of Naomi's husband?", "correct": "Boaz", "options": ["Brian", "Zebulen", "James"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoaz.\n\n\tRuth 2:1 \"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.\" Ruth was a poor woman, so perhaps Naomi wanted Ruth to marry Boaz so he could look after her when Naomi died. \n"}, {"text": "It says Ruth gleaned in Chapter 2. What does \"glean\" mean?", "correct": "to gather", "options": ["to find", "to create", "to injure"], "explanation": "\n\n\nto gather.\n\n\tGlean is gathering little by little to be more specific. In the Bible, the poor were the ones that did the gleaning. The owners of the field didn't harvest the edge of the fields, they left that for the poor people in the land. \n"}, {"text": "How does Boaz describe Ruth, in Ruth 3:11 (according to the KJV)?", "correct": "virtuous", "options": ["beautiful", "charming", "wonderful"], "explanation": "\n\n\nvirtuous.\n\n\tRuth 3:11 \"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.\" Ruth was virtuous for many reasons, among her faith to God and her loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi. \n"}, {"text": "How much barley did Boaz measure?", "correct": "six measures", "options": ["four measures", "three measures", "five measures"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsix measures.\n\n\tRuth 3:15 \"Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.\" I am not sure what he measured the barley in, it only said \"six measures\" in the KJV of the Bible. \n"}, {"text": "Who was Ruth married to before she married Boaz?", "correct": "Mahlon", "options": ["Asa", "Joshua", "Asher"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMahlon.\n\n\tRuth 4:10 \"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.\" Mahlon's name means \"sick\". It is interesting that Mahlon has this name because he died, leaving Ruth a widow before she married Boaz. Perhaps he died from a sickness as his name would suggest. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last word of the Book of Ruth?", "correct": "David", "options": ["Obed", "James", "Ruth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid.\n\n\tRuth 4:22 \"And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.\" The next book of the Bible, and therefore the next quiz I shall be making in this series, is I Samuel. Ruth only had four chapters. \n"}]}
