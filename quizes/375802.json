In which European capital city, 3,635 miles east of America, does the opening scene take place?", "correct": "Paris", "options": ["London", "Madrid", "Budapest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParis.\n\n\tThe terrorist's mission is to plant a weapon of mass destruction in the centre of Paris, France.  Unfortunately for both the terrorists and the Parisians, Team America arrive in time to save the day.  The initial gun battle takes place in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower; a landmark ultimately destroyed along with the Arc de Triomphe by a missile launched by our heroes.  A second missile launched by Team America's air support destroys the Louvre.  Team America begin to celebrate.  \r \"Bonjour everyone, don't worry, everything is bon; we stopped the terrorists!\" announces team member Joe to a group of incredulous Parisians, as they gaze open-mouthed at what remains of some of their most famous and historic landmarks.\r Their success however, is tinged with sadness at the death of their colleague Carson, shot and killed by a wounded terrorist in the aftermath of this engagement. \n"}, {"text": "The actor Gary Johnston is performing in the play 'Lease - The Musical'.  As he retires to his dressing room to sound of cheering and applause, how does Gary explain his superb acting skills to two members of the production team?", "correct": "He ponders over the saddest moment in his life.", "options": ["He thinks about a dream acting role.", "He dreams about spending his millions.", "He imagines that he is Robert DeNiro."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe ponders over the saddest moment in his life.\n\n\tGary Johnston is a troubled soul who hides a terrible secret; his acting skills were the cause of his elder brother Tommy being killed whilst protecting him on a trip to the zoo.  Gary had slipped and fallen into the gorilla enclosure and his brother had jumped in to protect Gary from the troop of blueberry-crazed gorillas; try and work that one out if you can!  It was this dreadful event, the saddest of his life, which drives Gary's particularly emotional style of acting.  As Gary returns to his dressing room he is confronted by Spottswoode, the enigmatic and slightly camp head of Team America.\r 'Lease - The Musical' is a spoof based on the Tony Award winning musical 'Rent'.  The first scene in which Gary Johnston appears is at the climax of the play with the assembled cast singing the song 'Everyone has AIDS', a finale which culminates with rapturous applause and a standing ovation from the audience. \n"}, {"text": "\"OK, a limousine that can fly, now I have seen everything,\" says Gary as he and Spottswoode, the head of Team America, fly over New York City on their way to the organisation's remote headquarters complex. \"Really? have you seen a man eat his own _____?\"\n\nWhich body part does Spottswoode ask Gary if he'd ever seen a man eat?", "correct": "Head", "options": ["Arm", "Leg", "Foot"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead.\n\n\tAs Spottswoode and Gary leave the New York theatre in the organisation's stretched Lamborghini limousine, Gary asks what their meeting is all about.  Spottswoode explains that there are certain people who want to kill Gary because of everything that he represents.  As they travel onwards to Team America's headquarters, the car is suddenly transformed into a jet aircraft which takes off as they cross the busy Brooklyn Bridge and the vehicle flies over the backdrop of the New York city skyline and ascends into the clouds.\r \"OK, a limousine that can fly, now I have seen everything,\" says a surprised Gary.\r\"Really? have you seen a man eat his own head?\" asks Spottswoode slightly sarcastically.\r\"No,\" replies Gary as Spottswoode goes on to elaborate about the incident in Paris the week previously. \n"}, {"text": "Team America's base is located under one of the United States' most famous man-made attractions.  Which remote landmark is this?", "correct": "Mount Rushmore", "options": ["Hoover Dam", "Golden Gate Bridge", "Statue of Liberty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Rushmore.\n\n\tTeam America's headquarters are securely sited within Mount Rushmore.  Entry is made into the complex through George Washington's mouth.  After meeting the team for the first time, Spottswoode explains the mission that Team America have planned for Gary.  Spottswoode explains that, should Gary not want to accept, he can leave. He is surprised when Gary simply thanks him, turns and walks out! \r \"Meh,\" utters Spottswoode as he stands there surrounded by an expectant team, his arm raised in the direction of the door that Gary has just exited through.\r Mount Rushmore was also featured in the classic 1959 Hitchcock adventure 'North by North-West' in addition to its use here as Team America's base. \n"}, {"text": "Within the Team America headquarters complex, who, or what, is I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E?", "correct": "It is a sophisticated computer system.", "options": ["It is a nickname mockingly given to the janitor.", "It is a board game played by the team.", "He or she is a team member with psychic powers."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is a sophisticated computer system.\n\n\tI.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E is Team America's super computer, the most sophisticated IT system in the world... allegedly. However, this computer is not as sophisticated as its name suggests.  It has a penchant for stating the obvious with much of its so-called intelligence being merely gleaned from news networks across the globe.  Perhaps D.U.N.C.E. would be a more appropriate moniker! \n"}, {"text": "To a tavern in which capital city, 5,621 miles east of America, do the team travel in order to enable Gary to infiltrate a Chechen terrorist cell?", "correct": "Cairo, Egypt", "options": ["Jerusalem, Israel", "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Astana, Kazakhstan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCairo, Egypt.\n\n\tTavern?  It's highly unlikely that any jihadi would frequent a tavern!  After masterfully acting his way into the Chechen terrorists' confidence, Gary is suddenly ushered into a waiting vehicle; Team America operatives have been spotted outside!  During the chase Gary, whose acting is so good, fails to convince Joe and Chris in the pursuing vehicle that he is, in fact, on their side - although this probably says more about Joe and Chris!  Once again Team America succeed in destroying an ancient Pyramid and a group of equally ancient statues. As Gary is plucked from the escaping vehicle by Lisa, the explosives-laden terrorist vehicle collides with the Sphinx and explodes, destroying that monument as well. \n"}, {"text": "Which fictional pacifist organisation is led by the Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin?", "correct": "The Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.)", "options": ["Amnesty International (A.I.)", "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (C.N.D.)", "Greenpeace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.)\n\n\tAlec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Helen Hunt, Susan Sarandon and George Clooney are all members of the Film Actors Guild or F.A.G.  Surprisingly, both Alec Baldwin and George Clooney had no issues with being lampooned in such a high profile way. Baldwin was even considering lending his vocal talents to his own character and Clooney is on record stating that he would've been disappointed if he had not featured in the film, as he is friends with both Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Sadly the same cannot be said of Sean Penn who took umbrage and sent the film-makers a letter expressing his anger at being mocked in such a manner! \n"}, {"text": "How does Dr Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations Weapons Inspection Team, meet his end during a visit to the palace of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il?", "correct": "He is killed in a shark attack.", "options": ["He chokes on a peanut.", "He falls from a window in a high tower.", "He is run over by a golf cart."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is killed in a shark attack.\n\n\tDr Blix arrives demanding access to every area of Kim Jong-il's palace and threatens him with a nasty letter expressing the UN's displeasure should he fail to comply.  Angered, Kim Jong-Il manoeuvres Blix into a position over a trapdoor in the floor which he then releases, sending the unfortunate inspector plummeting to his death into a tank containing the North Korean leader's pet sharks.  \r It shouldn't be funny, but his headless corpse, and later his skeleton, still carrying his briefcase, always raises a wry smile and a little chuckle. \n"}, {"text": "A second major terrorist attack results in the deaths of thousands of people.  The target is which major national and international facility located 2,193 miles south of the real America?", "correct": "The Panama Canal", "options": ["The Trans-Siberian Pipeline", "The Mall of America", "The Thames Flood Barrier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Panama Canal.\n\n\tWhilst Gary and Lisa enjoy a night of passion together, in what could be considered to be the most amusing scene in the film, another terrorist group launches an attack on the Panama Canal early the following morning.  On hearing this terrible news and believing that his actions and those of Team America in the Egyptian fracas were responsible for this retaliatory strike, Gary turns to drink. This results in a drunken Gary laying face down and unconscious in a deep pool of his own vomit... Gross! \n"}, {"text": "Which American film-maker manages to gain entry to Team America's Mount Rushmore headquarters and successfully carries out a suicide bomb attack?", "correct": "Michael Moore", "options": ["Ron Howard", "Michael Myers", "Quentin Tarantino"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Moore.\n\n\tWhilst Team America are engaged in a dogfight with aircraft piloted by both Durka-Durkastani terrorists and by the North Korean Air Force, a drunken Moore infiltrates the Team America headquarters complex and detonates an explosive vest killing himself and severely damaging their headquarters.  \r Described by the team's supercomputer as a 'giant socialist weasel', there had been some antagonism between Michael Moore and the film-makers over an interview and a cartoon that Moore had aired on US television.  Revenge, as they say, is a dish best served cold... And if you can do it publicly, so much the better! \n"}, {"text": "During Gary's intensive military training under the direction of Spottswoode, what is it that the accompanying song says that we, the viewers, need?", "correct": "A montage & montage", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nA montage & montage.\n\n\tArriving back at Team America headquarters to find it has been destroyed, Gary proves to Spottswoode, in a most unorthodox manner that he is, once again, committed to the team and wishes to mount a mission to rescue his colleagues from the clutches of Kim Jong-il.  Using a popular cinematic clich\u00e9, the split screen montage, the scene shows Gary being trained in shooting, fitness and self defense. \n"}, {"text": "Which incredibly good looking pair of actors are the first members of the Film Actors Guild to be killed in Team America's assault on the North Korean dictators palace?", "correct": "George Clooney and Liv Tyler", "options": ["Jane Fonda and Rod Steiger", "Samuel L Jackson and Martin Sheen", "Jack Nicholson and Jessica Tandy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Clooney and Liv Tyler.\n\n\tAfter their rescue by a now highly trained Gary from the dungeons under the palace of Kim Jong-il, Team America make an attempt to save the lives of the world leaders gathered for the World Peace Conference.

At the age of 19 after being invited backstage by the cast of the musical play 'Cats', Chris was accosted by characters Rumpus Cat and Macavity; Rumpleteazer then held him down whilst Mr Mistoffelees molested him.  Thanks to Gary's help, Chris' faith in actors and acting is now restored! \n"}, {"text": "In which manner do F.A.G. members Danny Glover and Sean Penn meet their untimely ends?", "correct": "They are attacked and killed by Kim Jong-il's pet panthers.", "options": ["They suffocate in a smoke filled room.", "They fail to jump a high-voltage electric fence.", "Penn fumbles a hand grenade."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are attacked and killed by Kim Jong-il's pet panthers.\n\n\tAfter successfully trapping Team America's Sarah and Joe in a sealed room, Glover and Penn release Kim Jong-il's panthers.  Sarah employs her psychic powers to take control of the animals' minds.  Once this has been achieved she compels the cats to leap through the glass partition that separates them from Glover and Penn, both of whom are promptly ripped to pieces and killed! \n"}, {"text": "The climax of the World Peace Conference sees the North Korean leader making good his escape in his natural form at the controls of a tiny spaceship.  In the form of which ancient and virtually indestructible pest does the North Korean leader resemble during his escape?", "correct": "A cockroach", "options": ["A porcupine", "A mouse", "A newt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cockroach.\n\n\tAfter his failure to detonate the WMD's located strategically across the world, a furious Kim Jong-il shoots Alec Baldwin dead in front of the assembled world leaders.  Unbeknown to him, his captive Lisa has managed to get within striking distance behind him.  \r \"Terrorise this!\" she cries...\r Lisa, delivering a swift kick to the North Korean leader's nether regions, causes him to fall from the balcony and die, impaled on the pickelhaube being worn by the conference representative from Germany.  Revealed as an alien species resembling a cockroach, the creature that was occupying the body of Kim Jong-il exits the corpse through its mouth and hurries to an awaiting spacecraft announcing on his way that, like General Douglas McArthur, he will return one day to complete his mission.\r But, for now, civilisation and the world are saved!  Hurrah! \n"}]}
