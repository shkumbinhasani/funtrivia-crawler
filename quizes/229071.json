Average Trivia |   Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies U-Z", "V for Vendetta"], "questions": [{"text": "\"V For Vendetta\" was directed by The Wachowski Brothers, who co-directed the \"Matrix\" films.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAndy and Larry Wachowski produced and co-wrote the screenplay for the film, but James McTeigue directed it. \n"}, {"text": "We never get a clear view of the face of \"V\" (Hugo Weaving), as he is always either in disguise, shot from afar, or wearing his very distinctive mask.  What historical figure does his mask emulate?", "correct": "Guy Fawkes", "options": ["Julius Caesar", "Henry VII", "The Scarlet Pimpernel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuy Fawkes.\n\n\tThe man calling himself \"V\" clearly takes inspiration from Guy Fawkes, the man who, in 1605, attempted to blow up Parliament due to his extreme disapproval of the governing body. \n"}, {"text": "In the futuristic, fascistic England depicted in the film, the most feared branch of the law enforcement structure takes its nickname from a part of the human body.  Which part?", "correct": "finger", "options": ["eye", "nose", "ear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfinger.\n\n\tMr. Creedy (Tom Pigott-Smith) heads up \"The Fingermen\", law-enforcement officers who apparently have the power to do anything they want to anyone they choose.  Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) recognizes that she is in grave danger early in the film when she encounters \"Fingermen\" in a dark alley after curfew. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last name of Evey (Natalie Portman), the ostensible protagonist of the film?", "correct": "Hammond", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHammond.\n\n\tWe see Evey Hammond's full name several times in the film (on her ID card), and hear it spoken by some of the men seeking her out, as well.  (Hammond is also a very popular brand of electric organ.) \n"}, {"text": "Both Evey and \"V\" recite lines from a famous poem during the film.  What date is mentioned in this poem?", "correct": "November 5", "options": ["September 5", "September 11", "November 11"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNovember 5.\n\n\tThe poem is known as \"The Bonfire Prayer.\"  The segment of it that we hear more than once in the film is:  \"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.\"  This is, of course, a reference to Guy Fawkes, who attempted to destroy Parliament on November 5, 1605. \n"}, {"text": "Evey tells \"V\" that, as a child, she appeared on stage in a production of a Shakespeare play.  Which one?", "correct": "Twelfth Night", "options": ["Measure For Measure", "Hamlet", "Romeo and Juliet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelfth Night.\n\n\tEvey played Viola in the production.  \"V\", a Shakespeare aficionado, is of course quite impressed.  He even throws out a Viola quote to Evey at one point. \n"}, {"text": "We learn that, years ago, \"V\" was the subject of bizarre, inhuman experiments at a detention facility.  What was the name of this facility?", "correct": "Larkhill", "options": ["Aldenfrost", "Newcastle", "Ravenscroft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarkhill.\n\n\tThe inmates of the Larkhill Detention Facility were subjected to numerous government experiments involving genetic enhancement, which explains (perhaps) the physical durability of \"V\". \n"}, {"text": "Late in the film, we learn that \"V\", years before, admired and drew strength from a woman who had been imprisoned in the cell next to him at the detention facility.  This woman, Valerie, had been an actress prior to her imprisonment.  What was the name of the movie for which she was most well-known?", "correct": "The Salt Flats", "options": ["Three Years of Roses", "Three Waters", "This Is Who I Am"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Salt Flats.\n\n\tIn the letter from Valerie that Evey reads during her imprisonment, Valerie notes that \"The Salt Flats\" was her most popular movie.  \"V\" later shows Evey a room in which he has framed a poster advertising that very film in honor of Valerie, the woman who saved his sanity during his own incarceration. \n"}, {"text": "According to his own dialogue, what movie is \"V\"'s favorite?", "correct": "The Count of Monte Cristo", "options": ["Robin Hood", "The Scarlet Pimpernel", "Ivanhoe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo.\n\n\t\"V\" makes sure that Evey watches the 1934 version of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (in which Robert Donat played the title character) with him.  Given that the film is all about taking revenge on one's enemies behind a clever disguise, it's not difficult to see why \"V\" loves the film! \n"}, {"text": "We never learn the real name of the man known primarily as \"V\" throughout the film.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tHe's called \"the man in room five\" a couple of times, but we never learn the real name of the man who meant so much to Evey Hammond, and to the people of England. \n"}]}
