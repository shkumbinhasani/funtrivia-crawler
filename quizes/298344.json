Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.\"\r Edom gets its name (which means red) from its red sandstone terrain t(his is where the red city of Petra was located), and from Esau. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the verse from Obadiah 1:4 using the King James Version. \"Though thou exalt thyself as the __________...\"\n\n", "correct": "eagle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\neagle.\n\n\tThe eagle may not necessarily mean the bird we think of today.  In Biblical times the word often translated as \"eagle\" referred to any large bird of prey. Sometimes (such as Exodus 19:4) it is translated from the Hebrew as \"vulture\". \n"}, {"text": "Who is mentioned in Obadiah 1:6?", "correct": "Esau", "options": ["Jacob", "Gad", "Joseph"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsau.\n\n\tObadiah 1:6 \"How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!\"\r Esau is considered the father of the Edomite nation. \n"}, {"text": "What is being described in 1:7?", "correct": "treason", "options": ["the twelve tribes of Israel", "a romantic dinner", "High School Musical"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntreason.\n\n\tObadiah 1:7 \"All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.\" \r In the New Living Translation this verse says \"\"All your allies will turn against you.  They will help to chase you from your land.  They will promise you peace while plotting to deceive and destroy you.  Your trusted friends will set traps for you, and you won't even know about it.\"\r This version I think makes it even clearer how it is related to treason. It describes people who are trusted, yet who are deceiving and trapping us. \n"}, {"text": "Who was violent against Jacob?", "correct": "Esau", "options": ["Joseph", "Gad", "Simeon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEsau.\n\n\tObadiah 1:9-10 \"And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.\"\r Jacob had stolen Esau's birthright when they were younger. A birthright consists of special privileges given to the oldest son. This also includes a special blessing. Esau was the father of Edom and Jacob was the father of Israel, causing these two nations to have problems with each other. When Obadiah wrote his book, these problems were still going on. \n"}, {"text": "When does Obadiah say the people should not have rejoiced over the children of Judah in Obadiah 1:12 (King James Version)?", "correct": "The day of their destruction", "options": ["The day of their denial", "The day of their delightful childhood", "The day of their dangerous journey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe day of their destruction.\n\n\tObadiah 1:12 \"But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.\"\r Obadiah gives a reminder that one should not be happy at the misfortune of others. \n"}, {"text": "Who should not have been cut off at the crossway?", "correct": "Those that escaped", "options": ["Those that eloped", "Those that encouraged", "Those that entertained"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThose that escaped.\n\n\tObadiah 1:14 \"Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.\"\r According to one Bible Commentary (Easy English) this was the worst thing the people of Edom could have done. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Obadiah say there shall be deliverance?", "correct": "Mount Zion", "options": ["Judah", "Edom", "Mount Rushmore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Zion.\n\n\tObadiah 1:17 \"But upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\"\r Zion could refer both to Jerusalem and to the New Jerusalem which is Heaven. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Obadiah say shall possess Gilead?", "correct": "Benjamin", "options": ["Levi", "Judah", "Napthali"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\tObadiah 1:19 \"And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.\"\r Benjamin was the youngest of Jacob's children.
