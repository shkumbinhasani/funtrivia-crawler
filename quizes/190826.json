{"id": "190826", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Comrades In Arms' (Part I) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 6"], "questions": [{"text": "So let's get to the big question.  Fans of 'M*A*S*H' probably never imagined that Hawkeye and Margaret could ever get amorous.  So who was it that came up with the script detailing this unlikely event?", "correct": "Alan Alda", "options": ["Linda Bloodworth", "Larry Gelbart", "Loretta Swit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlan Alda.\n\n\tAlan Alda both wrote the script for this episode and co-directed it with Burt Metcalfe, the producer.  I suppose that Alda wanted to finally have a go at Hot Lips, having heard all the rumors! \n"}, {"text": "While Hawkeye and BJ mangle two different operas in the shower tent, much to the chagrin of Charles, Colonel Potter has heard news from the 8063rd.  They have requested that a doctor and nurse come by and demonstrate what technique developed at the 4077th?", "correct": "Arterial transplant", "options": ["Antrectomy", "Skin graft", "Phlebotomy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArterial transplant.\n\n\tAccording to Colonel Potter, 'The 8063rd is all agog over our arterial transplant technique.  They heard we know how to save a leg when the artery's destroyed and the C.O. up there begged me to send him my best surgeon to demonstrate the technique.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye gets to go to the 8063rd to demonstrate the technique because he loses after drawing straws with the Colonel, BJ and Charles.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn actuality, Colonel Potter chooses Hawkeye over Charles and BJ because 'he's done dozens of them'.  Charles and BJ (and Hawkeye) all complain, but to no avail.  'My goodness, but you boys are competitive,' says the Colonel.  I wonder if the actual reason Hawkeye was selected had to do with who wrote the script for the episode, hmm? \n"}, {"text": "Despite his mild reluctance at the assignment, Hawkeye displays his willingness to take part in the demonstration.  Much of his willingness derives from the fact that he gets to select the nurse of his choice to assist.  Unfortunately for Hawkeye, Margaret uses her veto power and volunteers to come along with him to the 8063rd.  In the process, she reminds the viewer about who taught the technique to Hawkeye.  Who was the originator of the surgical technique that they will display for the doctors at the 8063rd?", "correct": "Dr. Borelli", "options": ["Dr. Pak", "Dr. Lin Tam", "Dr. Stanley Robbins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Borelli\n\n\tDr. Borelli appears in the season three episode 'The Consultant', and is played by Alan Alda's dad Robert.  In that episode Borelli reveals a severe drinking problem, and Hawkeye is forced to perform the arterial transplant following Borelli's instructions.  Borelli/Robert Alda would appear again in the season eight episode 'Lend a Hand'. \n"}, {"text": "As Hawkeye and Margaret prepare to depart for the 8063rd, Colonel Potter provides them with some sulfa and a box of 'fancy cling peaches'.  What does Potter hope Hawkeye can get in return for these two items?", "correct": "Penicillin", "options": ["3.0 silk", "Syringes", "Tongue depressors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenicillin.\n\n\tCome now.  At the 4077th they are always short on penicillin, all fans of 'M*A*S*H' should be intimately aware of this.  BJ suggests that Hawkeye should get no less than 50 vials of penicillin for the peaches.  Apparently, peaches were a hot commodity in Korea during the war. \n"}, {"text": "Along with the sulfa and peaches, BJ and Hawkeye have added lipstick, nylon and perfume to the equation.  What item does Charles 'donate' for the purposes of trading?", "correct": "Caviar", "options": ["Quails eggs", "P\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras", "Cognac"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaviar.\n\n\tWhen BJ includes the jar of caviar with the other trade items, Hawkeye asks, 'Did Charles mind?'  BJ responds, 'Didn't say a word.  Didn't even wake up.'  As Hawkeye drives off, Charles runs from the Swamp shouting 'He stole my caviar!'  It seems that Charles has some sort of automatic caviar sensor implanted in his brain. \n"}, {"text": "Braving some dangerous shelling, Hawkeye and Margaret finally arrive at the 8063rd only to find that the camp has been abandoned; they've bugged out.  Here's a tricky question: What is the motto of the 8063rd according to their 'official' signpost?", "correct": "We never close", "options": ["The hospital that never sleeps", "Best care anywhere", "You can count on us"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe never close.\n\n\tFans of 'M*A*S*H' will recognize that 'Best care anywhere' is the motto of the 4077th.  The 'We never close' motto is probably meant to be ironic, as the camp is completely abandoned when Hawkeye and Margaret arrive.  All that remains are some stones, tires, metal barrels and other refuse, along with the signpost.  Needless to say, Margaret and Hawkeye are rather dismayed. \n"}, {"text": "On their way back from the site of the 8063rd, the jeep that Margaret and Hawkeye ride in breaks down.  Neither Margaret or Hawkeye are able to fix the jeep, and they are forced to hide when some North Korean soldiers arrive.  The soldiers are able to start the jeep and make off with it.  Margaret asks, 'How can a grown man be so mechanically incompetent?'  What is Hawkeye's response?", "correct": "I take a lot of cabs", "options": ["I slept through two years of shop class", "I'm allergic to dirty work", "We still ride horse and buggy in Crabapple Cove"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI take a lot of cabs.\n\n\tAs Margaret and Hawkeye ride along, the jeep starts making funny noises, and before the viewer knows it, the vehicle has broken down.  Hawkeye attempts to 'fix' the jeep by kicking it a few times before Margaret insists that he actually open the hood.  When Hawkeye gives up, Margaret kicks the jeep in frustration, prompting Hawkeye to suggest that 'I've already tried that'. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye and Margaret are forced to improvise since they are now on foot.  They find a lovely little shack that Hawkeye describes as the 'local YMCA'.  Nearby, Hawkeye sees an injured North Korean soldier.  Is he able to administer aid to the wounded man?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tOnce they reach the shack, Hawkeye observes a wounded soldier lying in a field nearby.  After bickering with Margaret about 'staying down', Hawkeye reaches the hurt man only to find that he is too late...the man is dead. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye returns to the shack where Margaret awaits.  Just after he enters the tiny hut a shell goes off, injuring Hawkeye.  Where does Hawkeye take a wood fragment?", "correct": "Leg", "options": ["Foot", "Arm", "Abdomen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeg.\n\n\tThe shell forces Margaret and Hawkeye onto the floor of the hut, with Hawkeye landing on top of his favorite nurse.  When Margaret threatens, 'You better get off me buster,' Hawkeye suggests that he is unable to because he has something 'stuck in [his] leg'.
