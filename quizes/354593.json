Which Old Testament AND New Testament descendants of Benjamin shared the same name?", "correct": "Saul", "options": ["James", "Ehud", "Matthew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaul.\n\n\tKing Saul and the apostle Paul had the same name, originally. King Saul was stated to be about a head taller than his fellow countrymen. Saul, the apostle, had his name changed by God to 'Paul' after his conversion to Christianity. \rThe name Paul means small, little, or diminutive one. \r Both of these men named Saul were of the tribe of Benjamin. Benjamin had HIS name changed also. His mother had named him Ben-oni; meaning \"Son of my Sorrow\", just before she died immediately after delivering him in childbirth. His father, Jacob (Israel, who also had HIS name changed by God), changed the name of his youngest son to Ben-Yamin, meaning \"Son of my Right Hand.\"\r (Question submitted by logcrawler.) \n"}, {"text": "Former FunTrivia member Birdman earned the nickname Barnabas because he was always encouraging and exhorting members of the Bible Believers Brigade. According to Acts 4:36, Barnabas was the nickname given to a member of the early church because he was a tremendous encouragement to others. Now tell me, what was the real first name of the Bible's Barnabas, as per the King James Version and the New King James Version?", "correct": "Joses", "options": ["Simon", "Achaichus", "Marcus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoses.\n\n\tThe correct answer is Joses. (In the NIV, the name appears as Joseph.) In addition to being a source of encouragement to members of the early church, Barnabas, a native of Cyprus, was a generous giver. Acts 4:36-37, in the NKJV, states: \"And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.\"\r As a personal aside, I was a grateful recipient of Birdman's (Marten's) messages of encouragement hundreds of times. And when I say hundreds of times, I mean exactly that. Every time I posted a Bible quiz, 'Barnabas' would send a message, via FunTrivia, thanking me for my efforts and exhorting me to carry on. I have posted more than 300 Bible quizzes at FunTrivia and Marten has sent thoughtful messages of encouragement for practically every single one. I am grateful he has a special talent for putting wind in my sails. Keep smiling, Marten... and may God richly bless.\r (Question by Cowrofl.) \n"}, {"text": "Many know that Balaam's donkey spoke to him. She wanted to know why he was beating her. Balaam was annoyed that she refused to continue going like he wanted, but why did she refuse?", "correct": "An angel of the Lord was blocking the way.", "options": ["Balaam was not paying her well enough and she decided to go on strike. ", "She was tired.", "She knew of a shortcut and wanted to save time."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn angel of the Lord was blocking the way.\n\n\tYou can find this story in Numbers 22. Balaam was a non-Israelite prophet. He was promised a great fee if he would curse the Israelites. \r (Submitted by Ilona_ritter.) \n"}, {"text": "David, whom God referred to as \"a man after my own heart\", committed adultery with this woman and even arranged for her husband to be killed. The man that David arranged to have killed was Uriah and his wife's name was what?", "correct": "Bathsheba", "options": ["Bernice", "Baalah", "Bithiah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathsheba.\n\n\tThough David, the second king of Israel, was forgiven by God for this incident with Bathsheba, there was still a price to be paid. That price was the death of the child that was born as a result of their adulterous union. Later though, after David and Bathsheba's marriage, Solomon was born. He was considered the wisest man ever, other than (for Christians) Jesus Christ.\rThis story can be found in II Samuel 11. \r (Question submitted by rredman95.) \n"}, {"text": "What question did Jesus ask of Bartimaeus before he healed him?", "correct": "What do you want me to do for you?", "options": ["What is your father's name?", "How long have you been blind?", "How old are you?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat do you want me to do for you?.\n\n\tSee Mark 10:46-52.  Since Bartimaeus was blind, it may seem obvious what he wanted Jesus to do for him.  However, Jesus says that it was Bartimaeus' faith which healed him, so perhaps it was important for him to express what he longed for.\r Bartimaeus means 'son of Timaeus', so Jesus would not have needed to ask what his father's name was.\r (Question submitted by cal562301.) \n"}, {"text": "Who was the King of Israel who was at war with Asa, the King of Judah?", "correct": "Baasha", "options": ["Baca", "Bakbuk", "Bahurim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBaasha.\n\n\tBaasha was king of Israel for 24 years (Holman Illustrated Pocket Bible Dictionary). He probably reigned from 908-886 BC.

", "correct": "Barabbas", "options": ["Bartholomew", "Benhadad", "Barnabas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarabbas.\n\n\tWe see in the 23rd chapter of Luke that Barabbas was a political prisoner as well as being a criminal guilty of murder. He went by the name \"Jesus Bar-Abbas\". The name \"Jesus\" means \"Savior\" and the name Barabbas is from two Hebrew words; \"Bar\", meaning \"son of\" and Abba, meaning \"father\"; so in essence he was claiming to be the \"Savior, and the son of God\". He was not the first of the so-called \"messiahs\" to inflict heavy political losses upon the Jewish Sanhedrin. Many others had preceded him in their efforts of sedition (or rebellion) against both the Jewish Sanhedrin (ruling political and religious body) and the Roman Empire. \r The mob of common people were encouraged by their leaders to demand the release of this man, Barabbas, in place of Jesus, whom the Sanhedrin deemed to be even more dangerous to their national welfare at the time. They realized that simply a word from Rome or the Procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate, could result in instant annihilation of their nation.\r One thing that Barabbas had claimed, which had led to his imprisonment in the first place, was that he was a \"king\"; and that flew in the face of the Roman government, which after its bout of problems with the ancient Etruscan civilization, had vowed to never have a king, such as had been inflicted upon them by the Etruscans. The Jewish leaders were aware of this perspective of the Romans and exploited it to their advantage. \r Pontius Pilate was even more concerned with the claims that the Sanhedrin had laid on Jesus, specifically that of His kingdom. When Pilate questioned Jesus about this, the simple response came back that implied that Pilate said such a thing and Jesus did not deny nor acknowledge the claim. He further stated that His kingdom was \"not of this world\", and a perplexed Pilate was forced to return Him back to the Jewish leadership after a scourging. \r As things developed, we all know that in the end, Jesus was crucified instead of Barabbas, and Christians believe that such was God's plan all along. \r (Question submitted by logcrawler.) \n"}, {"text": "The following account may be found in the Old Testament book of Numbers, chapters 22-24...\n\nI was one of the kings of ancient Moab; the modern-day country of Jordan. I once tried to get a heathen prophet to curse the nation of Israel. He was well known for his abilities to interpret dreams; later becoming a magician, until finally the spirit of prophecy descended upon him. Most Bible students will recognize him as Balaam, but not as many may know MY name! \nCan you help them out?  ", "correct": "Balak", "options": ["Baruch", "Baalpeor", "Barack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBalak.\n\n\tYes, my name was Balak, and I ruled over ancient Moab. I was greatly disturbed by the military advances made by the Jewish people and I got fearful that they might attack my country, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I hired the best \"rasha\" (or 'wicked one') that I could find to take care of business for me. His name was Balaam; a man of a great reputation as a soothsayer, and I fully trusted that he would be able defeat the Israelites with just a word. \r I offered him a small fortune just to curse them, but he wound up BLESSING them instead! Needless to say, I was NOT pleased! So, I sent him back to try again... and again.. and again. I even went with him, eventually, because I wanted the job done RIGHT! (The incompetent jerk!)\r Over and over he continued blessing those people and when he saw how angry that made me he offered my servants this explanation - \"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God\".\r I finally gave up in disgust, and told him just to hush, telling him not to curse or bless them anymore, BUT NO-O-O! He had to go ahead with even MORE blessings for them! \rMan, Balaam was SOME \"evil\" prophet and \"bad guy\" huh? We both just finally gave up and went our separate ways.\r So even Balaam, a truly godless heathen, recognized the power of God. Now what does that tell you?\r By the way, Ilona_ritter has already asked question 3 in this quiz about Balaam's donkey. Ironically, I had already chosen a different question about the same event!\r (Question submitted by logcrawler.) \n"}, {"text": "Who took the body of Joram, King of Israel, and threw it on Naboth's land?", "correct": "Bidkar", "options": ["Bichri", "Bigtha", "Bigvai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBidkar.\n\n\tThis story can be found in II Kings 9.
