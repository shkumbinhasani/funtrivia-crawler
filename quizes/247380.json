{"id": "247380", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Aid Station' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "It's always the same in the mess tent, awful food and unhappy faces.  At least, this is the case for most of the personnel.  Radar, on the other hand, seems to love the slop they have to serve on a daily basis at the 4077th.  Case in point, the beginning of this episode, where we see two tremendous piles of what on his plate?", "correct": "Mashed potatoes", "options": ["Corn", "Grits", "Hash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMashed potatoes.\n\n\tProving once again that he is willing to take one for the team, Radar nearly single-handedly takes care of the 4077th's allotment of flaked potatoes.  Trapper and Hawkeye are dually impressed by the potatoes on Radar's plate.  Hawkeye refers to the two mounds as 'potato falsies'.  As if to thank him for the attention, Radar offers to finish Hawkeye's food, too! \n"}, {"text": "The top surgical staff are all called to Henry's office for some important business.  It seems that an aid station needs some assistance from the M*A*S*H 4077th.  Why is this so?", "correct": "A surgeon has been killed", "options": ["The front has moved a few miles south", "The Chinese are making a giant wedge attack", "There's a special case at the aid station that requires technical expertise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA surgeon has been killed.\n\n\tParticularly, it's an 'I' Company aid station that has lost a surgeon.  Until a replacement can be brought in, the 4077th has been asked to provide a cutter, a scrub nurse and a corpsman.  Ah, but who will volunteer? \n"}, {"text": "After hearing about this potentially deadly mission that Henry has described, does anyone offer themselves up as a volunteer?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tDear, brave Margaret offers her services immediately, she would never put any of her nurses at risk in place of herself.  All of the doctors remain mum, and for good reason! \n"}, {"text": "Among the doctors, a drawing takes place to see who will serve on this frightening mission.  What items are drawn, shortest one winning, in lieu of straws?", "correct": "Sausages", "options": ["Cigars", "Noodles", "Matchsticks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSausages.\n\n\tIf the sausages at that morning's breakfast are good for anything, it's for just this type of activity.  One sausage is shorter than the other two, and all three are placed neatly in a bedpan.  Trapper and Frank are the first two to draw, and they both select full sausages.  Pack those bags, Hawkeye! \n"}, {"text": "Klinger is selected to go on the dangerous mission thanks to a random selection by Father Mulcahy.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPoor Klinger, he doesn't even have any choice in the matter.  The impressive thing is that Klinger shows no fear.  Rather, he goes through his women's clothing, letting Radar know who should receive each item in the case that he is killed during the mission. \n"}, {"text": "In a conversation between Frank and Margaret, Hot Lips reveals something about her mother, namely her profession.  What occupation was Margaret's mother involved in?", "correct": "Nursing", "options": ["Accounting", "Stenography", "Photography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNursing.\n\n\tMargaret claims herself to be an army brat, her father an army colonel and her mother a nurse.  She claims that she was 'conceived on maneuvers'.  Margaret followed in her mother's footsteps by becoming an army nurse herself. \n"}, {"text": "Having been the unlucky doctor selected to go to the aid station, Hawkeye prepares his things.  In the Swamp, he informs Trapper that he has made out his will.  All of his possessions are to go to the Benjamin Franklin Pierce Memorial what?", "correct": "Brothel", "options": ["Old folks home", "Airport", "Library"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrothel.\n\n\tHawkeye seems rather flippant considering the serious mission he has been engaged to undertake.  In addition to the mockery of his own will, Hawkeye also jests with Trapper about his 'fidelity'.  He insists that Trapper cannot go out with other doctors while he's gone.  Trapper responds that Hawkeye should knock several times before entering the Swamp when he returns. \n"}, {"text": "While the aid station is being heavily bombarded by bombs, Klinger makes a call to the 4077th to inform Radar of his status.  What are the charming codenames that the two of them use?", "correct": "Snow White and Grumpy", "options": ["Peter Pan and Captain Hook", "Bambi and Thumper", "Alice and the Mad Hatter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnow White and Grumpy.\n\n\tKlinger is Grumpy and Radar is Snow White, not sure how happy Radar is about that proposition.  He seems more concerned about Klinger here, though.  Klinger complains that the enemy is 'exploding live shells'.  Their phone conversation is cut short, creating a great deal of worry for Radar and the others at the 4077th. \n"}, {"text": "In the Swamp, Trapper seems rather subdued, but Frank is quite chipper.  Frank is whistling a very patriotic tune while he flosses his teeth.  What song would this be?", "correct": "God Bless America", "options": ["The Star Spangled Banner", "Battle Cry of Freedom", "When Johnny Comes Marching Home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGod Bless America.\n\n\tAn annoyed Trapper barks at Frank, '14 choruses of God Bless America is enough'.  Frank's whistling and teeth flossing are just masking his nervousness.  Soon enough, Radar arrives at the Swamp, very lonely.  Despite Frank's protestations, Trapper generously allows Radar to take Hawkeye's bunk.  Henry soon follows, looking for a nightcap.  They're all very concerned about their mates at the aid station. \n"}, {"text": "Another musical question.  What song do the gleeful Hawkeye, Margaret and Klinger sing as their jeep rolls back into camp?", "correct": "The Army Goes Rolling Along", "options": ["Over There", "You're a Grand Old Flag", "Hail Columbia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Army Goes Rolling Along.\n\n\tAlso called 'The Army Song', 'The Army Goes Rolling Along' features the lyrics:\r 'Over hill, over dale \rAs we hit the dusty trail, \rAnd the Caissons go rolling along. \rIn and out, hear them shout, \rCounter march and right about, \rAnd the Caissons go rolling along.'\r Hawkeye takes the opportunity during a moment of quiet to let Margaret know that she is his favorite officer in the U.S. Army.  Klinger seconds that, telling Hot Lips that she's 'aces'.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
