The city of Chernobyl is a few miles away. Both cities were abandoned after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The population of almost 50,000 people were evacuated from Pripyat within two days of the disaster in 1986. There is much disagreement as to how safe the city is today.While there are a few companies that offer tours of the ghost town, governmental permission must be obtained. Many scientist claim that radiation levels are still much too high and that a visit to the city for any reason is not safe. The population of the city is listed as 0, and military guards and police watch the perimeter 24 hours a day.Part of the reason for this is to prevent looting, which occurred in both cities after the disaster. These areas are known as the \"Zone of Alienation\". \n"}, {"text": "In which American state would you be if you were standing outside the forbidden location known as Area 51?", "correct": "Nevada", "options": ["Oklahoma", "Virginia", "Florida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNevada.\n\n\tThere are signs all around the perimeter of Area 51 advising that it is illegal to enter the location and that attempts to do so may result in death.
