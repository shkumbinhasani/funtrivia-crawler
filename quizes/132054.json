What do the French call these strange schoolboys?", "correct": "Bennett and Mortimer", "options": ["Jean and Didier", "Jacques and Denis", "Stompa and Maritimes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBennett and Mortimer.\n\n\tApparently the translators of the books needed to ensure that they chose names that could actually be pronounced by French schoolboys. \"Jennings\" was too difficult for them to get their tongues around and \"Mortimer\" sounded typically British. \n"}, {"text": "Complete the following expression of surprise: \"fossilised ....\"", "correct": "fishhooks", "options": ["factory hooters", "flounders", "flute players"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfishhooks.\n\n\tBy now the repetition of the sound is not unexpected but it is still not clear why each expression refers to turning something into stone - \"petrified\", \"fossilised\" and then one more later. \n"}, {"text": "When Jennings was trying to write an article about Mr.Wilkins for the school newspaper which three letter word did he have problems with?", "correct": "row", "options": ["bow", "vow", "now"], "explanation": "\n\n\nrow.\n\n\tUnfortunately the word \"row\" has two pronunciations.
