However, rumors as to the origins of the baby exist, and a famous actor was supposedly the basis for the face of the Gerber baby.  What actor have many believed to be the famous Gerber baby?", "correct": "Humphrey Bogart", "options": ["Buster Keaton", "Clint Eastwood", "Clark Gable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHumphrey Bogart.\n\n\tIt is just a myth, a fable, and a downright lie that Humphrey Bogart is the face of Gerber.  The Gerber Baby was first introduced in 1928.  A contest was held where many people entered their paintings, drawings, and quick sketches of babies.  The judges would decide which of the pieces of art would be used. Dorothy Hope Smith (a professional children's artist) entered her charcoal sketch of a baby to the judges, and told them that if she won, she would finish it professionally.  Of course, the judges liked her sketch and no changes were made to her charcoal baby.  Since then, the famous Gerber baby has remained; a simple \"rough draft\" that was never finished. \n"}, {"text": "There is a sugar substitute that has been given a bad reputation because of internet hoaxes and other false stories.  It is said to cause cancer and other diseases, and eventually cause death.  However, it is safe, unless you have the somewhat uncommon disease phenylketonuria.  What is the substance?", "correct": "Aspartame", "options": ["Sucralose", "Saccharin", "Cyclamate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAspartame.\n\n\tAspartame in itself is harmless.  However, consumed in large quantities, and especially if you have phenylketonuria, it can be somewhat harmful.  Diet sodas have been given a bad rap because they use aspartame, and many refuse to drink it because of the deadly effects of aspartame. However, these stories are completely false, and aspartame will not harm you.  Phenylketonuria is uncommon, occurring in only one out of 15,000 births in the United States.  It is a genetic disorder, and can be treated from infancy so the child does not have it in later years. \n"}, {"text": "A famous actress has often been accused of having a sixth toe, which was removed early in her career in Hollywood.  This, of course, is a lie, as she never had six toes, and there is plenty of evidence to support this.  Who is the actress?", "correct": "Marilyn Monroe", "options": ["Bette White", "Pamela Anderson", "Audrey Hepburn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarilyn Monroe.\n\n\tThe story of Marilyn Monroe having six toes began when Joseph Jasgur took photos of Norma Jean Dougherty at nineteen years of age, in 1946.  It wasn't until 1987, however, that Joseph Jasgur claimed he had been making prints of the photos for a book of the lost photos of Marilyn Monroe, and discovered that she had six toes on her left foot.  However, many supporting facts can support this as bunk.\r First, why had Joseph not noticed the sixth toe in person, as he was taking photos of her feet?  Second, there is no record of anybody from Marilyn's early life as having said she had six toes.  Third, this was the only photograph of Monroe that appears that she has six toes.  Fourth, there are no records of her having a foot surgery, no people have seen her with bandages on her foot, and she was never reporting as limping on a foot at any point in time in her career.  Finally, the picture taken is simply a mirage.  Shadowing, paired with the natural bulge on one's foot by the pinky toe, make the foot appear to have an extra toe. However, this is a completely false story, and Marilyn Monroe was born with five toes on each foot. \n"}, {"text": "Oftentimes, kids like to play in the play area of fast food restaurants.  But some parents will not let their kids play in the ball pits, because a killer could be lurking below the surface of the balls.  What do some fear are in the ball pits of play areas?", "correct": "Rattlesnakes", "options": ["Scorpions", "Black Widow Spiders", "A masked maniac with a claw hand ready to kill whoever steps on him"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRattlesnakes.\n\n\tAlthough you may hear stories or get emails with a story of a kid \"recently being killed by a snake\" in a ball pit, this story is completely false.  There are several variations to the story; rattlesnakes, asps, and vipers are all used, and McDonald's and Burger King have both been the location of the \"recent\" death.\r The story says that snakes like to live in the ball pit because it's warm and dark.  The truth is, though, that snakes tend to stay away from a busy population of people.  The movement of the balls would be too much for the snakes.  Also, since they are cold-blooded animals, they rely on the sun to stay warm; and since not much can penetrate through the ball pit, it's actually quite cold for a snake.\r Of course, this does not mean that a ball pit is completely safe, either.  Candy, food, diapers, needles, and knives have been found in ball pits.  It's important to check whether the ball pit is cleaned routinely before letting your children play in one. \n"}, {"text": "When the album first came out, it was believed that the UPC code on the back was actually this artist's phone number.  People across the country with that phone number received hundreds, some thousands, of calls, from fans hoping to talk to the artist.  Who was this singer, and what album claimed to have the singer's phone number on it?", "correct": "Michael Jackson - \"Thriller\"", "options": ["Meat Loaf - \"Bat Out of Hell\"", "Fleetwood Mac - \"Rumours\"", "AC/DC - \"Back in Black\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Jackson - \"Thriller\".\n\n\tMichael Jackson's best-selling album, \"Thriller\", was released in 1982.  The seven-digit UPC code on the back of the album was often believed to be Michael Jackson's phone number.  However, this proved to be quite false.  All over the country, people with those seven digits as their phone number received a ton of calls every day from fans hoping to speak with Michael Jackson.  Unfortunately for fans, they never found Michael Jackson.  Also unfortunately for those with that phone number, as they received up to 50 calls a day.\r People with the phone number 867-5309 also experienced this irritating occurrence when Tommy Tutone released \"Jenny (867-5309)\".  Another urban legend: some believe that the number 867-5309 has been permanently disconnected across North America, and nobody has that number.  This is mostly true, as most of the area codes have had this number disconnected, but some people do still have 867-5309 as their phone number--and still get prank calls. \n"}, {"text": "Oftentimes, we are warned not to throw rice at weddings.  It is said to be harmful to birds.  Why is it supposedly bird-unfriendly?", "correct": "They will explode", "options": ["They will choke", "They are allergic to rice", "They will be stepped on while eating the rice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey will explode.\n\n\tThe myth of rice being dangerous to birds is completely false.  It is said that the rice will expand in the bird's stomach, and cause it to explode.  This is not true, however.  Birds do not explode when they eat rice, and thus throwing rice is not a danger in that sense.  However, throwing rice at a wedding does create one major problem.  Grains of rice can be quite a slipping hazard as you are walking.  Many fall because of slipping on rice.  But no birds explode because of it. \n"}, {"text": "Some people believe that a certain farm animal will die if it rains.  People claim that when it rains, this stupid animal will look straight up and drown to death in the rain.  But to them I say \"balderdash!\"  They won't die.  What animal is believed to be too stupid to prevent themselves from drowning in the rain?", "correct": "Turkey", "options": ["Pig", "Cow", "Sheep"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurkey.\n\n\tSome people believe that the turkey is such a stupid animal that it looks up when it rains.  As the turkey looks up, the rain will drown the turkey.  This is a completely falsified story, however.  There are several reasons why this is false.\r Turkeys have eyes on the side of their head, which allows it to see from all directions.  A turkey would actually have to turn their head sideways to look up at the rain.\r Also, turkeys actually do not have the capacity to be transfixed by the rain.  They will react one of two ways to rain:  1) find shelter; they don't like the rain, or 2) don't do anything; the rain doesn't bother them. \n"}, {"text": "It is sometimes said that a particular restaurant no longer uses the word \"chicken\" to describe their food.  This is not true; they use the word chicken, and they use chicken in the food.  What restaurant was the basis of these lies?", "correct": "KFC", "options": ["Long John Silver's", "Chick-Fil-A", "Popeye's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKFC.\n\n\tKFC has been the attack of a few rumors, including serving fried rat instead of chicken.  It is also said that they serve \"mutant\" chickens, and once discovered, stopped using the word \"chicken\" to describe their food.  This is yet another example of a false story about fast food ingredients.  It is also said that KFC pumps chickens full of chemicals to make them plumper; with breasts so plump a chicken falls forward and cannot walk.  This is false as well.  KFC uses real chicken. \n"}, {"text": "Some people have been influenced by the lie that a certain hair color will no longer exist within a few centuries.  It is said that because the hair color gene is recessive, most other hair colors will be passed on to a child, and this hair color will not exist in 2202.  What hair color will supposedly die off within 200 years?", "correct": "Blonde", "options": ["Red", "Brunette", "Black"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlonde.\n\n\tAccording to some stories, the WHO conducted research about blondes.  It was said that because the blonde gene is recessive, a child will more than likely get the dominant hair color gene, and not be blonde.  It is also said that as time goes on, fewer and fewer people will have blonde hair.  Therefore, some believe that the blonde gene will disappear in 200 years.  Sources even state that the research has proved that the last natural blonde will be born in Finland in 2202.  This story, however, lacks any real evidence or solid research. \n"}, {"text": "Some people tend to believe that there are bodies of dead workers poured in the cement of a famous landmark.  It is said that working conditions were so horrible that many died and fell in the cement; and other workers did not care enough to pull the bodies out.  This, of course, is false.  Which structure is said to contain dead bodies?", "correct": "Hoover Dam", "options": ["St. Louis Arch", "Pyramid of Giza", "Berlin Wall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHoover Dam.\n\n\tStories of the Hoover Dam containing worker's bodies is just a myth.  It is claimed that the project was so big that it was a \"nuisance\" to have to take the time to remove the bodies from the structure.  However, though roughly 100 people died in the process of building the dam, none are entombed in it.  Nothing was allowed to be left in the dam, for structural support. Not even a tiny block of wood could be left.  The dam, after all, has to withstand the pressure of holding in all that water.  Therefore, a body in the wall would cause the structural integrity to weaken.  If anybody ever did fall in the concrete and die, the bodies were definitely removed. \n"}]}
