The Noise Abatement Society (NAS) reported a 28% increase in complaints over garden noise during the summer months of 2010 alone. Another survey carried out by one of the UK's biggest banks found that 4.5 million people have gone as far as moving house to escape from noisy and unruly neighbours. \n"}, {"text": "My neighbour Peter is a great guy to know.  Have any work that needs doing on your car?  He's the man... Although I do wish he wouldn't keep his garden like a workshop.  There are bits and pieces everywhere - It looks like a smaller version of the local scrapyard.  Anthony, my other neighbour says that he can be forced, by law, to keep his garden tidy (just like mine).  Can this be true?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThere is no legislative requirement for any person to maintain a neat and tidy garden...but there is one exception that may arise. If their garden has become infested with vermin due to it being an unhygienic mess, or if they may be storing hazardous substances on their property, then a visit by the local authority Environmental Health Officers may be advised. \rIf, however, the garden has just been allowed to grow wild or looks generally like a war zone, there is absolutely nothing that can be done... very unfortunate! \n"}, {"text": "Cupressocyparis leylandii, a tall green conifer, has become the bane of my friend Jeannie's life.  Her neighbour, Steve, planted them over 20 years ago and steadfastly refuses to cut them back as he says that they give him the privacy to which he is entitled.  Can you tell me, what course or courses of action are available to her should these trees become a nuisance?", "correct": "A civil word and, if unsuccessful, inform the local authority", "options": ["Remove any fencing and dig them out", "Cut down the offending trees", "Accept that he has a right to privacy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA civil word and, if unsuccessful, inform the local authority.\n\n\tNo-one is entitled to, or has the right to, do anything to the detriment of another person or their property. Jeannie's first course of action would be to politely request that Steve cut back or prune his trees.  If this fails then she should approach her local authority.  Under recent anti-social behaviour legislation, the authority can visit and assess whether or not any nuisance is being caused. If it is, they can then take any appropriate action to ensure that these trees no longer constitute a nuisance.  During 2010 over 1,500 complaints were received by councils over what is known as high hedge nuisance.This resulted in the issuing of 700 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders or ASBOs. \n"}, {"text": "I am a very lucky man, seriously I am. I live in a beautiful 420-year old Grade II listed cottage in a conservation area here in sunny Devon.  The only downside was that I had nowhere suitable to entertain my friends during the summer. So why are my neighbours so upset that I have built some new decking in my back garden?", "correct": "Because I haven't been granted planning permission", "options": ["Because they're worried about noisy parties", "Because they are jealous that it looks so lovely", "Because it has increased the value of my cottage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause I haven't been granted planning permission.\n\n\tAs a general rule in the United Kingdom, planning permission is not required should anyone wish to erect decking (for any overseas players who might call decking by another term, decking could be likened to a raised wooden patio), with a few exceptions.  These exceptions are:\ra.  If the deck is to be constructed within 20 metres of any highway.\rb.  Where the deck is at or above the level of the first floor of any building.\rc.  Should the deck be more than 3 metres in height at the balustrade from the original ground level.\rd.  If the decking affects the privacy of a neighbour.\re.  If you live in a maisonette or flat and, especially in my case,\rf.  If any decking is to be attached to any listed building or if it is situated within a conservation area. \n"}, {"text": "Yesterday evening, my friend Damian who lives in a semi-detached property with a shared driveway arrived home to find his neighbours, Tina and Will, had parked their car on one half of the drive and put their bins out for collection on the other half... Will says that, as Damian usually parks on the road outside their houses, he has the right to use the area to store his dustbins!  Hmmmm... What do you think?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt is a surprising fact that, as a shared driveway, each householder owns half of the driveway as shown on their title deeds, but they each have an unrestricted right-of-way over the other half.  What does this mean?  Well, I'm no solicitor but as I understand/interpret the rules, both Damian and his neighbour can park their cars on their own side of the driveway (this would not leave much room as a right-of-way) but are not permitted to use the other half of the drive for storage of bins etc as this would restrict any right-of-way of the other person if they had not used it to park their car... I suppose it's just common sense really? \n"}, {"text": "Anthony and Lisa... They're the lovely couple living in the cottage to my left (Peter the complainer is on the right) but now they've got my hackles up!  I've been complaining for months that their garden fence is in such a state that it lets the entire neighbourhood down but I came home tonight to see that they've had it replaced.  I am not a happy chap though!  Why might this be the case?", "correct": "They've annexed two inches of my property", "options": ["They've attached irritating wind chimes to it", "I've never been a fan of  wire mesh fencing", "They can look through it into my garden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey've annexed two inches of my property.\n\n\tA neighbour must follow the boundaries marked on the deeds to the property and the boundary as it exists when the fence is replaced.  They are not entitled to annexe or steal any of my land - not even as much as an inch.  The only exception to this rule is when a piece of land had been annexed and used without any dispute for a period of 12 years or more.  The ownership of this land would then be transferred to them under what is known as 'adverse possession' or 'squatters rights' but the laws that govern this are extremely complex.\r If a neighbour has repositioned the boundary then you are permitted and have the legal right to remove the offending fence in a reasonable manner. It is always good advice to try to resolve boundary disputes amicably. A recent case here in the UK, in Greater Manchester in fact, left one couple homeless after they lost their house through legal fees alone. \n"}, {"text": "Not to worry, as two can play at that game. I was going to go out at the weekend and prune my rather large Yew tree next to the adjoining fence, but now I don't think I'll bother. Anthony has said that he'll do it whether I give him permission to or not. \"Go ahead\" I say, \"but be prepared to face the consequences young man!\"  Why would his intention land him in very hot water?", "correct": "My Yew tree has a Tree Preservation Order upon it", "options": ["My Yew tree is highly toxic", "It is my Mother-in-Law's favourite plant", "It is a popular local landmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Yew tree has a Tree Preservation Order upon it.\n\n\tWe have such quaint and gentlemanly laws here in the UK... The law permits that you may cut any overhanging branch or any roots that are growing into your garden provided that they are returned to your neighbour or that you make an offer to return them to him/her.  However, my Yew tree is known to be 420 years old and, judging by its height and spread, probably considerably older than that! And it has a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) applied to it.  My neighbour would not only incur my wrath if he so much as looked at my tree, but would face the wrath of the local authorities and, in all probability, end up paying a hefty fine.  \r In fact the penalty as it currently stands for cutting down a tree covered by a TPO is a maximum of \u00a320,000 per tree!  The only occasions upon which such a tree may be cut down or pruned is if it is dead, dying or in an otherwise dangerous state or where it constitutes a nuisance or a threat to life and property.  Written permission must be obtained before any such work may be carried out. \n"}, {"text": "Oh dear... It seems that I can do nothing right and my neighbours are really mad now.  Not only did they not appreciate my decking, but Peter next door has really got the bit between his teeth!  My new summerhouse has been built flush with our garden fence and is just over 3 metres in height at the eaves... What can his problem be?", "correct": "It must be no higher than 2.5 metres at the eaves", "options": ["I have painted it in bright dayglo yellow", "I am using it to house my pet dog whilst I'm out", "I have let it as accommodation to a friend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt must be no higher than 2.5 metres at the eaves\n\n\tChanges to planning laws in October 2010 now mean that any outbuilding is now to be classed as a permitted development and does not require planning consent providing a number of conditions are met, but it looks as if I've upset the applecart big time with this project.  The maximum height of any outbuilding constructed within 2 metres of a boundary is 2.5 metres and as my summerhouse is flush with the fence and is over 3 metres in height at the eaves, it is likely that I'll be reported and that the building will have to be demolished. Not only that, but as my cottage is listed and in a conservation area, my decking will probably have to go as well!  If only I'd taken advice from the local authority... \n"}, {"text": "Excellent! The decking is down, the barbecue is lit, the beers are cooled, my friends have arrived and Focus are on the CD player... It's going to be a great night. Typically, that party pooper Peter, has seen fit to call the police and it's only 3am!  Surely there can't be a problem with the great Thys Van Leer and Jan Akkermann at this time of the morning?  Can there?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWe are all entitled to use and enjoy our property in any way just as long as our actions do not prevent others from doing the same and the fact that something that a neighbour does may irritate, it does not follow that the law is being broken.  Using noise of your own as a retaliatory measure could also result in you being just as guilty of being a nuisance.  The secret here is to be reasonable as this could escalate out of control.\r If reason doesn't seem to work, keep a diary that details the time, the date and the duration of any noise and, if possible, get other neighbours to do so as well.  Using this evidence, Environmental Health Officers can prevent further nuisance or restrict it to certain days and/or at certain times.  Any non compliance by those causing a nuisance can result in a fine of up to \u00a32,000. \n"}, {"text": "Well, well... Here we all are - Peter and his wife Jane, Anthony and Lisa next door, my friends Jeannie and Damian and a few others in various states of disorder.

There are 4 sensible steps that can be taken to prevent upsetting your neighbours or them upsetting you.  Firstly, most neighbourly disputes can be resolved through talking to each other.  Quite often there are no laws being broken and it can be put down to nothing more than a clash of personalities.\r Secondly, if talking fails, an assertive but polite letter is often effective but we must remember that being too assertive or simply resorting to threats will just inflame the situation. \r If talking and writing fail then it is likely that the professionals at the local authority will need to be involved at this stage and the local Environmental Health Office should be the next port of call.\r Finally, if all else fails, legal action will need to be considered. Consulting a solicitor that specialises in neighbourly disputes may be necessary, although this should always be as a last resort. \n"}]}
