{"id": "142827", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'A Full Rich Day' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "There are several episodes of 'M*A*S*H' entitled 'Dear Dad' from the first several seasons, the plots of which are all summarized neatly within letters sent home to Hawkeye's father.  'A Full Rich Day' is one such episode, though the namesake is different.  By what method does Hawkeye intend to deliver his message in this episode?", "correct": "Tape recorder", "options": ["Film", "Telephone", "Telegram"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTape recorder.\n\n\tHawkeye has somehow acquired a tape recorder, complete with microphone.  He not only records his own voice during the episode, but that of Trapper, Radar, Frank and Henry.  His message includes a description of the previous day's events, which are neatly summarized for you in the questions and additional info sections below! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's message to his father recalls events from the day before; a 'full rich day', he calls it.  The day begins with Frank Burns in charge of triage on a bus full of wounded.  After dealing with a particularly difficult Turkish patient (who shows up often within this episode), Frank Burns takes issue with Klinger's dress.  What is Klinger's response to Frank's command, 'Klinger, I want to see you out of that dress, tonight!'?", "correct": "Never on a first date, sir!", "options": ["Only if you bring me flowers, sir!", "I'm not that easy, sir!", "I'm not that kind of girl, sir!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNever on a first date, sir!.\n\n\tKlinger does use the 'I'm not that easy, sir!' response, but in another episode.  I added the other two responses for color.  By the way, in 'A Full Rich Day', Klinger wears a lovely nurse's uniform with a lovely red cape.  A rather modest outfit for Klinger, comparatively speaking. \n"}, {"text": "As if the crazed Turkish soldier is not enough for Frank, a jeep pulls up behind the bus full of wounded.  Driving the jeep is a muddied, stoic lieutenant with rifle firmly in hand.  In the back seat we see a wounded, unconscious man, a certain Sergeant Bryan.  What is the name of the driver, who demands instant medical attention for his sergeant?", "correct": "Smith", "options": ["Johnson", "Jones", "Douglas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmith.\n\n\tSmith, or Smitty, as Hawkeye calls him, essentially holds Frank and Radar at gunpoint, demanding that Sergeant Bryan be given first priority.  Later we learn that Smith is wounded as well, but sacrificed his own health for the good of his friend. \n"}, {"text": "The scene now shifts to the pre-op, where we see Hawkeye and Colonel Blake prioritizing the wounded.  Frank storms in, frantic about the angry and threatening lieutenant, much to Henry's disbelief. Soon after, the lieutenant proves Frank right by shepherding Radar and another orderly in with his Sergeant friend.  What unflattering term does the lieutenant use to describe Frank when he confronts Henry?", "correct": "Chicken lover", "options": ["Goonie bird", "Scared monkey", "Gutless wonder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChicken lover.\n\n\t'All right, who's the head man here?' asks Lieutenant Smith.  Frank, hiding behind and pointing toward Henry, answers, 'Um, he is!'  'You rank this chicken lover?' is Smith's response.  Hawkeye uses the term when he asks Smith outside for a word, but of course 'chicken lover' was nothing compared to 'ferret face'! \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye attempts to talk some sense with the lieutenant outside the pre-op.  During this dialogue we learn about Hawkeye's father's favorite book.  What is the only book, according to Hawkeye, that his father has ever read?", "correct": "The Last of the Mohicans", "options": ["Tom Sawyer", "The Sun Also Rises", "Gulliver's Travels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans.\n\n\tAnd 'The Last of the Mohicans', a book by James Fenimore Cooper, is the source of the Hawkeye nickname.  I believe this is the first episode where his nickname is explained.  Didn't do him much good here though, his words go in one of Smith's ears and out the other! \n"}, {"text": "After the initial chaos of the day, we see the doctors of the 4077th working away in the operating room.  Trapper and Frank work on Sergeant Bryan, while the Turkish patient falls under the care of Colonel Blake.  Before Henry can begin operating, however, his patient is aroused and threatens the denizens of the OR with what item?", "correct": "Syringe", "options": ["Scalpel", "Dagger", "Rifle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSyringe.\n\n\tHenry notices that the Turkish soldier has come to while on the operating table.  He requests that his assistant, Mr. Kwang, once again sedate the seemingly unsedatable Turk, but instead the patient wrests control of the syringe from the unwitting orderly.  Henry attempts to 'handle' the situation, and in one of the most hilarious moments of physical humor in 'M*A*S*H' history, takes one for the team.  He grabs the syringe, needle first, and proceeds to pass out! \n"}, {"text": "After the difficulties in the operating room, we move to Henry's office, where the Colonel is attempting to calm himself from the day's traumatic events.  No sooner does Radar pour Henry a drink when another colonel arrives, looking for a soldier from his contingent.  From what country does this colonel, surnamed Blanche, hail?", "correct": "Luxembourg", "options": ["Belgium", "Holland", "France"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuxembourg.\n\n\tColonel Blanche is searching for one of his men, a member of the small contingent of 'Luxembourgers' (as Henry humorously, but correctly, refers to them) that fought under UN command during the Korean War.  Luxembourg is a tiny duchy surrounded by Belgium to the north, France to the south and Germany to the east. \n"}, {"text": "It turns out that the soldier Colonel Blanche is looking for has been declared dead, and that his body has unfortunately come up missing.  What is the name of this poor chap?", "correct": "Henri Batiste LeClerq", "options": ["Andre Philippe Masson", "Claude Emile Breton", "Paul Camille Chardin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenri Batiste LeClerq.\n\n\tWhen informed by Radar that LeClerq has, 'sort of...died sir', Blanche responds, 'Those are the fortunes of war.'  However, when informed by Radar that 'we've lost him, you might say', Blanche, irritated, says, 'And that sir is not at all one of the fortunes of war!'  It turns out that LeClerq is not dead or missing, but rather is resting uncomfortably in the post-op.  When the national anthem of Luxembourg is played, he is drawn outside, and lines up next to his Colonel Blanche...all in madcap fashion, of course. \n"}, {"text": "Attention once again turns to the Turkish soldier, who has also come up missing.  Radar locates him in the kitchen and leads Hawkeye to him.  Hawkeye and the Turkish soldier have an interesting 'dialogue', butcher knives in hand.  What do word do both of them shout several times, slamming the knives down on a cutting board?", "correct": "Cinle!", "options": ["Kill!", "Koryan!", "Attack!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCinle!.\n\n\tAs the Turkish always say, 'Medyumlara r\u00fbh rol\u00fc oynar Cinle, bu hortlak! \u00c7a\u00f0\u00fdr\u00fdlan \u00f6l\u00fcn\u00fcn s\u00fbretine b\u00fcr\u00fcn\u00fcr!'  Actually, I have no idea what that means, just found it using a google search.  What I do know is that 'Cinle' is the Turkish word for Chinese, something that Radar discovers while flipping through a Turkish-English dictionary. Hawkeye mimics the agression of the Turkish soldier, and this resonates with the angry but injured Turk. \n"}, {"text": "After a meeting of minds between Hawkeye and the Turkish soldier, using oversized steak knives as props, a plan is hatched to once again sedate the crazed Turk.  Hawkeye convinces the Turk to join him and Radar in a toast.  With what drink do they toast?", "correct": "Prune juice", "options": ["Milk", "Whiskey", "Grape Nehi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrune juice.\n\n\tUnbenownst to the Turk, chlorylhydrate has been added to his cup of prune juice.  Radar is then asked to give up his clothes to the Turk and take him towards the Turkish unit.  Wearing only a toga, Radar drives off with the Turk, who is soon expected to pass out from the chlorylhydrate.  Unfortunately, Radar switched the cups, and he ended up with the sleeping concoction. The Turk returns Radar to the 4077th, announces that Hawkeye is a 'Damn good Joe!' and once again drives off.  And that is the end of a full, rich day at our favorite M*A*S*H unit.  I hope you enjoyed this quiz, and if so...feel free to play my other 'M*A*S*H' episode quizzes...thanks! \n"}]}
