{"id": "134005", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Private Charles Lamb' Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "As the episode opens we see Radar carrying a plate full of vegetables out to his menagerie.  Meeting his caged animals, he distributes the vegetables among them in typical Radar, egalitarian fashion.  Which of his animals does Radar actually pull out its cage to cuddle?", "correct": "Skunk", "options": ["Weasel", "Rabbit", "Raccoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkunk.\n\n\tJust prior to feeding his animals, Radar is accosted by Frank Burns, who demands to know why he has a plate full of vegetables (everyone knows that Radar doesn't eat vegetables!)  Frank demands that Radar prove he is going to eat the vegetables by eating them then and there, but Radar claims he is saving them for the movies.  As he puts it, 'I'm a vegetarian, I won't touch popcorn.'  After this, Radar goes outside and cuddles his skunk...wonder how they convinced Gary Burghoff to do that trick? \n"}, {"text": "During this episode, Hawkeye narrates one of his 'Dear Dad' messages.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tStrangely, though this episode is not one entitled 'Dear Dad', in the operating scene following Radar's veggiefest, Hawkeye narrates a message to his father.  Also unusual, this is the only excerpt of the letter that is read during the episode.  Every other time Hawkeye reads a letter to his dad, it carries through to the different scenes throughout the episode.  My theory is that they originally intended it to be a 'Dear Dad' episode and then dropped the idea... \n"}, {"text": "While in the operating room, where our favorite M*A*S*H doctors perform emergency surgery on a collection of Greek soldiers, Trapper explicates eloquently on which great of ancient medicine?", "correct": "Hippocrates", "options": ["Aristotle", "Galen", "Herophilus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHippocrates.\n\n\tAccording to Hawkeye's letter to his father, the M*A*S*H doctors have 'spent the better part of a whole day mending the heirs to Plato, Plutarch, Aristotle and Socrates.'  Trapper then discusses Hippocrates, who he says was 'born in 460' and 'wrote treatises on medicine and handed down concepts that are still used today.'  Frank then mentions the Hippocratic Oath, showing that he actually stayed awake for at least part of his medical school!  The doctors of the 4077th are indeed well-schooled... \n"}, {"text": "After the scene in the operating room, we shift to Henry's office, where a Greek Colonel has come to pay a visit, and to offer good tidings of a great feast.  What is the name of this Colonel?", "correct": "Andropolis", "options": ["Karamanlis", "Simitis", "Stephanopoulos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAndropolis.\n\n\tColonel Andropolis brings great news.  In return for the wonderful surgical job done on his men at the 4077th, and to celebrate Greek Easter, he has ordered Greek food to be flown in directly from the home country.  A Greek feast awaits! \n"}, {"text": "Aside from the grape leaves, lamb and other culinary delicacies that will be delivered to the 4077th for the celebratory feast, the Colonel excites Henry by the prospects of trying what famed Greek liquor?", "correct": "Ouzo", "options": ["Sake", "Gyro", "Soju"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOuzo.\n\n\tReally, is there any other possible answer to this question?  When Colonel Andropolis suggests that they will have 'bathtubs full of ouzo', Henry responds, 'I'll practice keeping my head under water!' \n"}, {"text": "The scene again shifts, this time to the post-op ward where Hawkeye relieves Trapper.  While consulting, the two of them discuss something unusual about the young Private Chapman that Hawkeye had operated on earlier.  What is Chapman's 'problem'?", "correct": "Self-inflicted wound", "options": ["Mentally retarded", "Homosexuality", "Loss of memory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSelf-inflicted wound.\n\n\tThough all of these topics are discussed during the 'M*A*S*H' series, in Chapman's case he has inflicted a gunshot wound on himself.  Trapper discovers this based on the powder burns on his leg and communicates it to Hawkeye.  The key, at this point, is not to let Frank know.  Unfortunately, Frank does discover Chapman's problem when he poses as Father Mulcahy.  Luckily, Frank is rebuked by Trapper and Hawkeye when he tries to report the poor Private. \n"}, {"text": "Upon discovering that a Greek feast is going to occur at the 4077th, Frank is indignant.  He confronts Henry in his office and insists that the party be called off.  Which of the following terms does frank not use to describe the coming festivities?", "correct": "Degenerate", "options": ["Paganism", "Bacchanal", "Debauchery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDegenerate.\n\n\tFrank is the first to meet the truck carrying the delectables, but he has no interest in gluttony, only military order!  While Hawkeye and Trapper dig into the pickled vegetables, fresh baked bread and bottled kalamata olives, Frank barges into Henry's office to lodge his complaint.  Frank's words...'Wild music, dancing, barbecuing live animals?  It's paganism that's what it is!  It'll turn into a bacchanal. I can see it Colonel, wine pouring over supple bodies, everyone engaged in debauchery and degredation!' and 'This is just the first step, you know.  Today it's a lamb, tomorrow you'll sacrifice a virgin!'  Henry's response...'In this camp?' and 'Let go Frank; rotten up like the rest of us.' \n"}, {"text": "While Frank is upset about the entire concept of a Greek feast, Radar is also disturbed, but for a different reason.  He discovers that a live roasted lamb is going to be the center course in the meal.  Using his typically underhanded methods, Radar manages to sneak the lamb, now designated as 'Private Charles Lamb', out of the camp.  When Henry questions the papers that Radar has him sign in the process, allowing Private Lamb 'emergency leave', how does Radar describe the 'Private'?", "correct": "Short, curly-haired guy", "options": ["Small, caucasian guy", "White, short-haired guy", "Blonde, sheepish guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShort, curly-haired guy.\n\n\t'He had to take an emergency leave,' according to Radar.  'Death in the family?' Henry asks.  Radar's retorts, 'Almost!'  Later, we learn that Radar, who earlier had drugged the lamb to put it to sleep, has sent the little fellow back to Iowa where he will become 'Radar's little brother' (Henry's words). \n"}, {"text": "Lambless, but with the party impending, a replacement main dish must be found.  Hawkeye saves the day by providing a lamb-substitute, made with which substance?", "correct": "Spam", "options": ["Tofu", "Liver pat\u00e9", "Liverwurst"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpam.\n\n\tWhile Private Lamb is enjoying the excellent accomodations on his cross-Pacific flight on 'Bo-Peep Airlines' (as Hawkeye puts it), the members of the 4077th are forced to enjoy a truly ridiculous 'spam lamb'.  There really is a frustration theme with the M*A*S*H television show when it comes to food...they always come close to enjoying something delicious, but somehow things go awry. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following characters actually participates in the drunken party that occurs during the last four minutes of the episode?", "correct": "Frank", "options": ["Father Mulcahy", "Klinger", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank.\n\n\tKlinger, Margaret and Father Mulcahy don't appear at all in the episode.  Meanwhile, the biggest party pooper of them all, namely Frank Burns, is lured into the bacchanal, bottle of ouzo firmly in hand.  Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it (and if so, please feel free to try my other 'M*A*S*H' episode, and general knowledge, quizzes!) \n"}]}
