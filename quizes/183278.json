{"id": "183278", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - B. F. 'Hawkeye' Pierce Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "M*A*S*H - Characters and Actors"], "questions": [{"text": "To begin, I shall ask a few easy questions in order to bolster your quiz scores (presuming you know your Hawkeye!).  What is the name of the small town in Maine that serves as home for Hawkeye?", "correct": "Crabapple Cove", "options": ["Spiral Jetty", "Mountain Meadows", "Bryce Canyon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrabapple Cove.\n\n\tSome interesting facts about Crabapple Cove: It doesn't exist in 'real life'!  Though throughout most of the series (and the book) Crabapple Cove is mentioned as Hawkeye's hometown, in a few instances his place of origin has varied.  In the year one episode 'Dear Dad', Hawkeye calls Vermont his homestate, while in the episode 'The Late Captain Pierce', Hawkeye claims that the family only has a 'summer cottage' in Crabapple Cove. \n"}, {"text": "In the series, Hawkeye is ambiguous about whether or not he has a sibling.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIn the episode 'Dear Dad, Again', Hawkeye clearly requests at the end of his letter to his father that the latter 'kiss mom and sis'.  However, in the much later episode 'Sons and Bowlers', Hawkeye states that his mother died in his youth.  Further confusion is created in the episode 'Hawkeye', when the good captain announces that he is an only child.  Fans of 'M*A*S*H' are left wondering...who is this guy? \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye sends numerous letters home to his dad during the run of the series 'M*A*S*H'.  What is his father's name?", "correct": "Daniel", "options": ["Robert", "Phil", "Milton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel.\n\n\tRobert is Alan Alda's father's name, while Daniel is Hawkeye's father.  There are a total of three 'Dear Dad' episodes during the running of the series (all within the first two seasons).  In addition, Hawkeye calls his dad on a couple of occasions. \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye's real name is Benjamin Franklin Pierce.  From which author's book does his nickname 'Hawkeye' come?", "correct": "James Fenimore Cooper", "options": ["Jonathan Swift", "Daniel Dafoe", "Herman Melville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper.\n\n\tSpecifically, Hawkeye is the nickname for the character Natty Bumpo from Cooper's 'Last of the Mohicans'.  The book happened to be the personal favorite of Hawkeye's father, Daniel Pierce (possibly because Hawkeye claims that it was the only book his father ever read...which I frankly find hard to believe). \n"}, {"text": "Now for some bigger challenges: In the episode 'The More I See You', an old flame of Hawkeye's arrives at the 4077th.  Though she is now married, Hawkeye attempts to convince her to marry him.  What was her first name?", "correct": "Carlye", "options": ["Maddie", "Samantha", "Emily"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarlye.\n\n\tCarlye Breslin, played by Blythe Danner, was Hawkeye's lover and roommate during his residency.  After going their separate ways (she claims that Hawkeye was only in love with his work), they met again at the 4077th.  After a brief rekindling of the flames of love, Carlye suggests once again that Hawkeye is too in love with his work to be committed to a woman. \n"}, {"text": "During the airing of 'M*A*S*H', Hawkeye proposed marriage to a nurse.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, in the episode 'Radar's Report', Hawkeye falls smitten for a nurse named Erika, played by Joan van Ark.  Alas, once again his dreams of love are shattered when she refuses his hand.  Obviously, she had bigger things in mind...for example her future television career! \n"}, {"text": "One of Hawkeye's old pals arrives at the 4077th in the touching season one episode 'Sometimes You Hear the Bullet'.  What is the name of this author friend?", "correct": "Tommy Gillis", "options": ["Steven Coverley", "Nate Richmond", "Hal Thompson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy Gillis.\n\n\tTommy Gillis is played by James Callahan.  In this episode, he portrays one of Hawkeye's longtime friends, also serving in the army.  He is doing research in Korea for a book he plans to write called 'You Never Hear the Bullet'.  Sadly, Tommy finds out the hard way that, indeed, sometimes you do hear the bullet.  After being shot in action, Tommy dies while Hawkeye attempts to operate on him. \n"}, {"text": "Here's an easy one for all of you dedicated 'M*A*S*H' fans.  What was the name of Hawkeye's imaginary childhood friend?", "correct": "Tuttle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTuttle.\n\n\tIn the season one episode 'Tuttle', it is revealed that Hawkeye once had an imaginary friend who was blamed for all of Hawkeye's ill childhood behavior.  In that episode, Hawkeye and Trapper create an entire persona for a Captain Jonathan S. Tuttle, with the help of the scheming Radar.  Tuttle's eventual death comes as a shock and surprise to both the residents of the 4077th and viewers alike! \n"}, {"text": "Here's one to churn your memory: Does Hawkeye appear in every single episode of 'M*A*S*H' from season one to eleven?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, he does.  In fact, Alan Alda (and Hawkeye) is the only actor to appear in every episode of the series.  Two other characters, Margaret Houlihan (played by Loretta Swit) and Father Mulcahy (played almost entirely by William Christopher) appear from the pilot episode to the last episode.  Neither of those characters, or actors, appears in every episode, however.  No other character or actor comes close to appearing in every episode of the series. \n"}, {"text": "For which of these did Alan Alda, aka Hawkeye Pierce, not win an Emmy Award during the television run of 'M*A*S*H'?", "correct": "Production of a Comedy Series", "options": ["Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series", "Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series", "Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProduction of a Comedy Series.\n\n\tAlda won Best Lead Actor Emmys in both 1974 and 1981.  He won the Emmy for 'Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Comedy-Variety or Music Series' for the episode 'Inga' in 1979.  He won his director Emmy in 1977 for the episode 'Dear Sigmund'.  He won a total of five Emmys for the show (also picking up an Emmy for 'Actor of the Year' in 1974).
