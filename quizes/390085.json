Where is her body found?", "correct": "In her closet", "options": ["In the living room", "In a well", "Under the floorboards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn her closet.\n\n\tThe film opens on Katie and Becca, both of whom are together in the evening at Katie's place.  While Katie talks about a video that can kill someone if they watch it in seven days, Katie gets increasingly worried because she watched said video a week earlier.  Becca disappears into the house shortly after a phone call is received and Katie is left on her own as a series of weird events occur in the kitchen.  Heading upstairs, she finds water leaking from her bedroom and turns the knob to find an image on her TV screen before it cuts to static.\r Her body is later found in her closet, bloated and disfigured, as her aunt Rachel hears from friends on the evening of her funeral. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel, digging into the mystery behind Katie's death, finds out that she and her friends linked by which of these?", "correct": "Their times of death", "options": ["Their recent test scores", "Their allergies", "Their recent hospital visits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir times of death.\n\n\tRachel is asked by her sister to investigate her niece's death and, as an investigative journalist, she feels capable to do so, quickly looking through Katie's bedroom and discovering that a week earlier she was doing normal things with her friends.  In a check through her personal scrapbook, it appeared that Katie had drawn over all of the pictures of girls she'd cut out, covering their faces with black ink. A photo developing slip leads Rachel to a studio in the city, but when she finds the photos, many of them feature Katie and her friends with blurred-out faces...at least the ones from before a visit they took to a trip to the Shelter Mountain Inn outside of Seattle. When Rachel discovers that the three teens Katie took the trip with all died under mysterious circumstances at different places at the same time, she decides to make a trip up to the lodge to dig deeper. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Rachel watch the VHS for the first time?", "correct": "In a cabin", "options": ["In her apartment", "At Noah's place", "At the office"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a cabin.\n\n\tRachel arrives at the Shelter Mountain Inn and asks about Katie and her friends' visit a week earlier to discover that they stayed in Cabin 12.  They had a lot of complaints, mainly about the TV; it's kind of why the place got tape players for videos a while back.  Rachel decides to take a night in the cabin and, while she waits for the paperwork, nabs a peculiar, unmarked VHS off the shelf.\r The place is certainly rustic.  When Rachel arrives, the sun seems to be setting, casting a red glow on the cabin.  She pops the VHS into the machine at 5:13 and static fills the screen before the ring appears.  What follows is a stream of cryptic images, some featuring people and others not.  The film ends with a woman throwing herself off a cliff and a stone well in the middle of a forest before flipping to static.  Seconds after Rachel turns off the TV, the phone rings.  A girl's voice on the other end tells her... 'seven days'. \n"}, {"text": "On the first day of her week, Rachel allows Noah to watch the video.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOn Day 1, Rachel already seems to be overwhelmed by what she's watched.  Her son heads to school as her ex, Noah, arrives at the apartment to help her out.  She asks him to take a photo of her on a digital camera and they find her face blurred in it, much like Katie's photos.  Despite her hesitance, she lets him watch the tape in her apartment at 8:10am.  She waits on the balcony until he's done and the phone rings.  This time, she lets it ring.  Noah tells her he'll look into it and he leaves.\r Popping the tape into an audio-visual setup at work, Rachel pores over the images on the screen, noting how the machine seems to be malfunctioning.  She pauses on an image of a windy cliffside and notes a fly in the top corner of the frame, almost as though someone were filming a video screen. \n"}, {"text": "What image appears beyond the frame of the video, only to appear when Rachel controls the tracking?", "correct": "A lighthouse", "options": ["A barn", "A well", "A graveyard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA lighthouse.\n\n\tOn Day 2, Rachel and Noah look at the copy of the tape together, trying to make sense of the weird technical hitches on the VHS.  At one point, Noah tries to control the tracking and Rachel sees that there's picture beyond the edge of the frame.  Rachel leaves before Noah's current girlfriend can watch the tape.  As she does, she passes under a tall, wooden ladder, not unlike the one from the video.\r On Day 3, Rachel visits Katie's friend, Becca, in the psychiatric hospital.  Becca doesn't say much, at least until Rachel brings up the tape and Becca sees she only has four days left.  Rachel brings the video to some better machines at work and copies some specific frames.  This time, she pulls the tracking on the cliff image to see what's beyond the edge of the screen.  It's a lighthouse. She manages to print it before it malfunctions.  When she brings it back to the cliff scene and pauses it, she sees the fly on the screen moving and manages to pull it from the image. \n"}, {"text": "Anna Morgan exclusively raised which of these animals?", "correct": "Horses", "options": ["Chickens", "Goats", "Dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorses.\n\n\tOn Day 4, Rachel pinpoints the location of the lighthouse as Moesko Island and she digs deeper into its past, locating a photo featuring the woman brushing her hair in the video.  She identifies that woman as Anna Morgan and learns her history as well, including her past as an award-winning horse trainer.  One year, her thoroughbreds died under mysterious circumstances; the photo for an article she finds about this also seems to have appeared in the video.  Anna Morgan died that year, committing suicide by jumping off a cliff after consistent hallucinations.  While Rachel does this research, she notices herself scribbling all over a photo of Morgan, much like the images in Katie's scrapbook.\r On Day 5, Noah sees his image in a store's security camera footage, but his face is blurred in real-time.  Rachel returns home to find the babysitter asleep and Aidan in bed.  While on the phone, she has a drink of water and dislodges something.  Reaching into her mouth she pulls out a long, black string, at the end of which she finds an electrode.  She heads to Aidan's room again but finds the girl from the video in a chair in the center of the room.  When the girl grabs her arm she awakens in her bed, having dreamt it.  She hears something though.  When she looks in the living room, she finds that Aidan has watched the video. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel discovers that Samara was Anna Morgan's biological daughter.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDay 6 is rainy and both Rachel and Noah decide to divide and conquer to get new information.  While Noah heads to Anna Morgan's psychiatric hospital, Rachel heads to the ferry to head to Moesko Island.  The trip isn't smooth for her as her presence startles a caged horse which, after it breaks free of its trailer, charges at her and plunges over the side of the boat and gets shredded by the propellers.\r Rachel inevitably makes it to the ranch to meet its sole occupant, Anna's widower, Richard, who also appears in the video in an upper floor window of the house.  They talk in the house (where Rachel sees the mirror from the video) and she reveals the tape before she's asked to leave without any answers.  As she leaves, she asks about his daughter...but he doesn't have a daughter.\r Noah, meanwhile, discovers information about a girl named Samara.  Rachel finds the same info from the Morgans' neighbours, specifically a former doctor, who reveals that Anna tried repeatedly to get pregnant, but always had trouble with her adopted daughter, Samara, who she says used to spook the horses. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel and Noah find a burned etching in the wall of the Morgans' barn.  What does it depict?", "correct": "A tree", "options": ["A person", "A chair", "A cabin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tree.\n\n\tNoah heads out to Moesko Island to get in touch with Rachel, bur Rachel is busy sneaking back onto the Morgan Ranch.  She lets herself into the house when no one answers since the door is open.  Inside, she finds videos from the psychiatric facility and information about Samara.  Popping a video into a player, she discovers that Samara had been in the institution because she had problems sleeping; her powers to etch images onto peoples' minds and objects was manifesting.\r As Rachel watches the video, she doesn't hear Mr. Morgan sneak up behind her to hit her.  Ripping the television out of the wall he brings it upstairs to the bathroom and, in front of her, drapes himself in electrical cables and slides into the overflowing bathtub before flipping the switch.\r When Noah finds Rachel, the two of them head into the locked barn to find the ladder from the video, and at the top of it, in the loft of the barn, they find an etching burned into the wood of the wall underneath a layer of wallpaper.  It's somewhere Rachel has seen before-- the red tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn. \n"}, {"text": "What causes 'The Ring' to appear?", "correct": "Light around the lid of a well", "options": ["Sunspots", "Lens flare on a video", "The burn of a cigarette on paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLight around the lid of a well.\n\n\tOn Day 7, Rachel and Noah rush to Shelter Mountain Inn, arriving in the early evening and checking into Cabin 12 as the sun sets and casts a red glow on the room.  Things seem hopeless until Noah starts tearing the cabin apart, inadvertently knocking a jar onto the floor and causing its contents to pool into a groove in the floor.  Lifting the rug, they find a damp spot in the wood panels underfoot and grab an axe.  Sure enough, there's something under it.  It's the well from the video.  Both have little time to contemplate what they've found.  After Noah pushes the lid off the well and they shine their lights inside, something breaks above them and the television crashes down onto Rachel, knocking her in.\r Rachel survives the plunge and Noah searches for rope.  While he's gone, the lid of the well seems to seal on its own as Rachel is grabbed from below and she suffers a vision.  In this vision, she sees Samara standing by a well as horse run in the meadow near the red tree.  Anna walks up behind her and places a plastic bag over her head, intending to suffocate her before pushing her into the well.  She never died though.  Instead, she hit the water and watched as the lid sealed her into her watery grave, forming a ring over the opening.  Rachel realizes that she lived in the well for seven days.\r Noah is eventually able to call for help and soon, the authorities are able to drag Rachel and the body from the bottom of the well. \n"}, {"text": "In the end, Rachel figures out that copying the tape and showing it to someone else is the only way to shift the curse off yourself.  Who does Aidan show the tape to?", "correct": "We never find out", "options": ["His teacher", "His cousin", "Rachel's coworker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe never find out.\n\n\tRachel survives her seventh day and returns home to Aidan and, when he wakes up, he's disappointed with her.  He says that Samara never wanted to be found; she never cared about that.  She's still after him despite the body being found and put to rest.\r At 8:10am on his final day, Noah watches as his television turns on and the well appears on the screen.  Samara emerges from the well, extending the scene from beyond what was originally shown, and as she nears the screen, she crosses the threshold and passes through it, crawling into his living room and stalking him around his apartment until she kills him.\r Rachel rushes to Noah's apartment, but it's too late.  When she heads inside she finds his body posed in a chair, bloated and deformed like Katie's when it was found.\r Rachel heads back to her apartment, seemingly at an end when she realizes what she did differently.  As Aidan explained, the point was never to save Samara, but instead to cause others to suffer like she did.  She finds the copy of the tape under her couch, where she threw it after finding Aidan watching it, and realizes that the curse only ends when she passes it along to someone new.\r In the end, Rachel takes Aidan to her office to make a copy of the VHS.  Both of them aren't sure who they'll get to watch it, but when they do, he'll be okay. \n"}]}
