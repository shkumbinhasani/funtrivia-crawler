{"id": "106995", "name": "Star Trek: Nemesis Quiz | Star Trek | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Trek", "ST X: Nemesis"], "questions": [{"text": "Where does the first major scene of the film take place?", "correct": "on the planet Romulus", "options": ["on the bridge of the USS ENTERPRISE", "on the planet Earth", "on the planet Betazed"], "explanation": "\n\n\non the planet Romulus.\n\n\tThe first scene of the film unfolds in the halls of the Romulan Senate. \n"}, {"text": "Much to the chagrin of many fans -- myself not included, incidentally -- Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) makes a very brief  appearance at the wedding reception of Commander William T. Riker (Johnathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  What does Wesley say in his one scene?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["\"Congratulations, Commander.\"", "\"Thanks, Mom.\"", "\"It was a beautiful ceremony, Counselor.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tWesley doesn't have a single line in the film!  We see him seated next to his mother at the head table at the reception, but he never says a word.  Kick your agent in the teeth, Wil!  \r (By the way, why was Wesley wearing a Starfleet uniform at the wedding?  In his last appearance on \"ST:TNG,\" he quit Starfleet and went wandering with the Traveler!  Come on, people!) \n"}, {"text": "Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), the former (?) Ten Forward hostess of the ENTERPRISE, makes an appearance at the reception as well.  She mentions to Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) that she is not interested in getting married again.  How many times, according to her own dialogue, has Guinan been married?", "correct": "23", "options": ["34", "12", "42"], "explanation": "\n\n\n23.\n\n\tIt should be noted that Guinan is at LEAST five hundred years old, and possibly much older than that. \n"}, {"text": "Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) sings a song at Riker and Troi's wedding reception.  Who wrote it?", "correct": "Irving Berlin", "options": ["Cole Porter", "Rodgers and Hammerstein", "Gilbert and Sullivan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIrving Berlin.\n\n\tData sings \"Blue Skies,\" written by Irving Berlin.  (Worf even groans \"Irving Berlin\" in disgust!)  Data's \"brother,\" B-4 (also played by Spiner), also sings a line or two from this song at the end of the film, proving that he does possess some of Data's memories.  Will B-4 eventually \"become\" Data?  Time will tell...if there's even another movie, of course. \n"}, {"text": "Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) gets painfully drunk at the wedding.  What beverage did he consume too much of?", "correct": "Romulan ale", "options": ["tequila", "Kentucky bourbon", "an unnamed green liquid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRomulan ale.\n\n\tWorf notes, in his anguish, that Romulan ale should be illegal.  La Forge points out that it is! \n"}, {"text": "Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is given urgent orders that force the ENTERPRISE crew to set a course for Romulus.  The ship was originally on its way to an entirely different planet, though.  Which one?", "correct": "Betazed", "options": ["Cardassia Prime", "Bajor", "Risa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetazed.\n\n\tThe original plan, after Riker and Troi's wedding on Earth, was to head to Betazed, Troi's homeworld, for a traditional Betazoid wedding.  As far as the events of the movie reveal, though, they never make it there.  I bet Deanna's mom is upset! \n"}, {"text": "Picard leads an away team -- against Riker's recommendations, as usual -- mainly because he is anxious to test-drive a new all-terrain vehicle.  What is it called?", "correct": "the ARGO", "options": ["the HERACLES", "the ODYSSEUS", "the ORPHEUS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe ARGO.\n\n\tI found this element of the film a little silly and anachronistic.  Why would Starfleet provide a starship with a 20th-century-level-technology automobile, which has a number of physical limitations, when shuttlecraft -- which can fly -- are standard issue? \n"}, {"text": "A regular character from one of the \"Star Trek\" television series (other than \"The Next Generation\") appears in this film.  In which series would one find this character?", "correct": "Star Trek: Voyager", "options": ["Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", "Star Trek", "Enterprise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStar Trek: Voyager.\n\n\tAs a huge \"Deep Space Nine\" fan, I was hoping for a nod to that show...but instead, we get a quick scene featuring Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), who has apparently been promoted to the rank of admiral since finally returning to Earth as the captain of the USS VOYAGER.  (Yes, Worf appeared on \"Deep Space Nine\" for several years...but he was a \"Next Generation\" character first, so according to the wording of the question, he doesn't count.) \n"}, {"text": "Picard, Worf, and Data discover scattered parts of an android that looks exactly like Data.  It later identifies itself as \"B-4.\"  True or False: This android was, in fact, constructed by Dr. Noonien Soong, the same man who created Data.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPraetor Shinzon (Tom Hardy) admits to having made some adjustments to the android, but it actually *was* built by Dr. Soong.  Shinzon and his minions found it, made their alterations, and left it as bait for the crew of the ENTERPRISE.  B-4 is therefore an official Soong-type android. \n"}, {"text": "The ENTERPRISE suffers an astonishing amount of damage during its protracted battle with the SCIMITAR, warship of Praetor Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  In fact, a notable item from the ship's bridge no longer exists by the end of the battle.  What is it?", "correct": "the viewscreen", "options": ["the helmsman's station", "the captain's chair", "the dedication plaque"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe viewscreen.\n\n\tThe \"front\" of the bridge is actually breached at one point -- the viewscreen is blown out into space, along with several crewmembers.  Luckily, the emergency force fields come online within a few seconds, saving the rest of the bridge crew and giving everyone on the bridge a rare \"authentic\" view (in other words, through a giant HOLE) of what lies before them. \n"}, {"text": "True or False: Deanna Troi says \"imzadi,\" the Betazoid word for \"beloved\" or \"soulmate,\" in the film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tRiker, as he climbs into bed with his new wife, says 'imzadi', as does Shinzon when he telepathically violates Deanna a few seconds later. The counselor herself, though, does not speak the word in the film. \n"}, {"text": "As often happens in a fictional universe as broad and established as \"Star Trek,\" there exists, in \"Nemesis,\" an error in continuity -- in other words, something in the film does not match what we've seen in the previous \"canon\" established by \"The Next Generation\" and the other series and movies.  What's the problem?", "correct": "We see a photo of Picard being bald as a young man, but he actually had hair at that age", "options": ["Worf is supposed to be stationed on Deep Space Nine, not the ENTERPRISE", "Data smiles several times, but his \"emotion chip\" was destroyed in an earlier film", "Romulus abandoned the \"senatorial\" political structure years ago, as shown on \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nWe see a photo of Picard being bald as a young man, but he actually had hair at that age.\n\n\tPicard invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to examine some old photos with him in his ready room.  One of them depicts a young Picard (played by Tom Hardy, of course, to solidify the idea that Shinzon is Picard's clone) as a young officer.  Picard is completely bald in the picture, but we saw in the \"TNG\" episode \"Tapestry\" that Picard actually had hair at that general age; in fact, a flashback in the episode \"Violations\" makes it clear that Picard still had hair even a few *decades* later.  Oops.  \r (As for the wrong answers: Worf left DS9 in the final episode of that series; the Romulan government has not changed substantially since we first learned about it; and Data's emotion chip was never destroyed in any of the previous films.) \n"}, {"text": "While in the stellar cartography lab, Picard uses a famous quote that Data does not immediately recognize.  To what work of literature has Picard referred?", "correct": "the bible", "options": ["\"Hamlet,\" by William Shakespeare", "\"The Prince and the Pauper,\" by Mark Twain", "\"Frankenstein,\" by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe bible.\n\n\tPicard says, almost under his breath, \"For now we see through a glass, darkly.\"  He is referring to Shinzon's observation that he (Shinzon) is a reflection of Picard.  The line is from the Book of Corinthians.  (Shouldn't Data, with his massive memory banks, have recognized that line, though?  Hmmm...) \n"}, {"text": "Just before Data leaps into the vacuum of space to cover the distance between the ENTERPRISE and the SCIMITAR, he shares a knowing look with Geordi that makes it clear that Data is pretty sure that he's never going to see his best friend again.  What does Data say, just before Geordi deactivates the force field and allows Data to engage in some amazing extra-vehicular activity?", "correct": "nothing", "options": ["\"Good-bye.\"", "\"B-4 is not my brother.  Lore was not my brother.  *You* are.  Please remember that.\"", "\"Feed Spot for me.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nnothing.\n\n\tThe silent look that the two friends share is quite powerful: they both know that it's the last time they will ever see each other.  Data's sad smile is proof positive that his emotion chip is functioning properly...and that Brent Spiner is a talented actor. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the film, Will Riker is finally, *finally* leaving the ENTERPRISE to become the captain of his own starship.  (Only took you fifteen years, Will!)  What is this ship's name?", "correct": "the USS TITAN", "options": ["the USS PHOBOS", "the USS GANYMEDE", "the USS EUROPA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe USS TITAN.\n\n\tThe general buzz seems to be that \"Nemesis\" will be the last \"Star Trek\" movie...but if it does extremely well at the box office, we all know that the series will keep going.  If it does, I expect we'll see Picard's ENTERPRISE and Riker's TITAN teaming up to fight for truth, justice, and the Federation way.  Hope you enjoyed the quiz! \n"}]}
