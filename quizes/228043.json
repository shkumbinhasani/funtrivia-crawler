The late, lamented Christopher Reeve played Superman/Clark Kent as an adult. Who played Clark as a teenager?", "correct": "Jeff East", "options": ["Aaron Smolinski", "Weston Gavin", "Lee Quigley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff East.\n\n\tJeff East wore a prosthetic nose to look more like Christopher Reeve, and all of his dialogue was later dubbed in by Reeve, to make the teenaged Clark sound exactly like the adult Clark!\r Lee Quigley played the infant Kal-El on his home planet of Krypton. Aaron Smolinski played the character as a toddler (when Jonathan and Martha Kent discovered him). Weston Gavin played the mugger who accosted the adult Clark (and Lois Lane) in Metropolis. \n"}, {"text": "Brad Renfro once played the teenaged version of a character played in adulthood by Brad Pitt.

The effects of the abuse visited upon Renfro's Michael were quite apparent in Pitt's portrayal of the adult version of the character. \n"}, {"text": "In the off-beat comedy \"Twins\" (1988), unlikely siblings Julius and Vincent (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito) searched for their mother, Mary Ann Benedict. When they found her, she was played by Bonnie Bartlett, perhaps best known for her role on TV's \"St. Elsewhere\".\nIn a flashback sequence, however, the twentyish Mary Ann was played by a then-relatively-unknown actress who, in 2006, was much more recognizable. Who played the younger Mary Ann Benedict?", "correct": "Heather Graham", "options": ["Anne Heche", "Sandra Bullock", "Courteney Cox"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeather Graham.\n\n\tBlink and you'll miss her, but that's Heather Graham playing Mary Ann, the young woman used as a \"guinea pig\" of sorts by a group of scientists experimenting with genetic manipulation. \n"}, {"text": "Dame Judi Dench and Kate Winslet once played the same novelist at different times in her life.  Which novelist did they portray?", "correct": "Iris Murdoch", "options": ["Joyce Carol Oates", "Harper Lee", "Dorothy Parker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIris Murdoch.\n\n\tDench and Winslet both played the title role in \"Iris\" (2001), the biopic directed by Richard Eyre.

The entire film was told in flashback, via the voice-over by a much-older version of Doug Holt. This voice-over was supplied by Michael Keaton. We never SAW Keaton, but he definitely identified himself as being an older version of Phoenix's character. \n"}, {"text": "Much of \"Big Fish\" (2003) was told in flashback, as the elderly Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) related the (possibly) tall tales that made up his life story to his son. Who played Ed Bloom as a young adult?", "correct": "Ewan McGregor", "options": ["Cary Elwes", "Billy Crudup", "Jim Caviezel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEwan McGregor.\n\n\tEwan McGregor and Albert Finney -- both citizens of the British Isles -- adopted American accents in their portrayals of Ed Bloom.  Billy Crudup played Ed Bloom's son, and despite the outlandish, fantasy-like elements of Ed's stories, the film was really a rather down-to-earth tale about a son trying to understand his father. \n"}, {"text": "John Houseman was one of the elder statesmen of American actors and acting teachers.  In which film did \"thirtysomething\" star Ken Olin play a younger version of a Houseman character?", "correct": "Ghost Story", "options": ["The Paper Chase", "Richard III", "My Bodyguard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGhost Story.\n\n\tIn \"Ghost Story\", the 1981 film based on the Peter Straub novel, the older version of Sears James was played by Houseman, and then-unknown Ken Olin played Sears as a young man. The film revolved around four elderly men who met regularly to exchange ghost stories, but found themselves in the midst of a real one thanks to a horrible mistake they made as young adults - a fine, creepy film! \n"}, {"text": "In which baseball-related film did William \"Billy\" McNamara play a younger version of a Mark Harmon character?", "correct": "Stealing Home", "options": ["Eight Men Out", "The Slugger's Wife", "The Natural"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStealing Home.\n\n\t\"Stealing Home\" (1988) mostly concerned itself with Billy Wyatt, a minor league baseball player who spent a lot of time in the film ruminating about his teenaged years, and his complicated relationship with the recently deceased Katie Chandler (Jodie Foster).

Sophia, the character played by Smith and Mathis, was perhaps the most tragic character in the film. She was portrayed as a graceful, lively young woman whose outlook on life was stifled, not enhanced, once she became a wife and mother. \n"}, {"text": "In this animated film, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick, through their voice work, played the same character at different ages.
