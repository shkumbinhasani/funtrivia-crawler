The keeper at the next post would pick up the message and send it  to the next tower and so on. This way the system took advantage of the mountainous terrain of the Greek islands and mainland and it conveyed messages to great distances. The system was used up to the 1850s and after it became obsolete, lighthouses were built on many posts of the phryctorias.\rFor those with an interest in geography, Aeschylus, in his work \"Agamemnon\" mentions the posts of the phryctorias that were used to transport the fall of Troy to Mycenae. \rFrom Troy the message went to Mount Ida, some 20 km southeast of Troy, from there to the island Lemnos, from Lemnos to the Holy Mountain Athos, from Athos to Mountain Makistos on Euboea and from there to Mountain Arachnaios, on the shores of Argolida. Mycenae is situated a few kilometers west of the foot of the mountain. \n"}, {"text": "The title of my quiz, \"Set Fire To The Rain\", is a favorite song by a young charismatic singer who burst into the music scene in 2008, with an album called \"19\". \nWhat is her name?", "correct": "Adele", "options": ["Pink", "Imany", "Zaz"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdele.\n\n\tEnglish singer and songwriter \"Adele\" Laurie Blue Adkins (b. 1988), recorded her first album \"19\", just two years after graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and it became a big success almost immediately.
