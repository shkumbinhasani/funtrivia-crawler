Paul Giamatti portrays Harvey Pekar in the film, but frequent appearances are made by the real Harvey for narrative purposes.  It's a strange and interesting film that really works...I recommend it! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actors does *not* appear in the powerful drama 'American History X', about an ex-Neo-Nazi trying to turn his life around?", "correct": "Matt Damon", "options": ["Edward Norton", "Avery Brooks", "Edward Furlong"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMatt Damon.\n\n\tEdward Norton is simply mesmerizing (and often frightening) in the lead role as the Neo-Nazi turned straight, Derek Vinyard.

Avery Brooks plays the principal at the high school where both Derek and Danny have attended. \n"}, {"text": "Which director, better known for his comedy films, takes a turn as a horror film auteur in the modern classic 'An American Werewolf in London'?", "correct": "John Landis", "options": ["Ivan Reitman", "Rob Reiner", "Harold Ramis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Landis.\n\n\tJohn Landis, who had previously directed 'Animal House' and 'The Blues Brothers', gave his fans a surprise twist by tossing at them a devilishly crafted horror film in 1981, namely 'An American Werewolf in London'.

It would be very small company, if anyone at all!\r 'An American in Paris' was a Best Picture Oscar winning film, featuring the direction of Vincente Minnelli, the writing of Alan Lerner, the music of the Gershwins and the film debut of the lovely Leslie Caron. \n"}, {"text": "In which country does the action in the 2002 film 'The Quiet American', featuring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser in the lead roles, take place?", "correct": "Vietnam", "options": ["Turkey", "Korea", "Algeria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVietnam.\n\n\tDirected by Philip Noyce, the film is based on a novel by the prolific author Graham Greene.

The cast also includes notable performances by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux and Willem Dafoe, as Detective Donald Kimball. \n"}, {"text": "We shall end this quiz on a humorous note.  Which 'American' movie features the comedy antics of a group of four high school senior friends who make an interesting pact about who losing their virginity?", "correct": "American Pie", "options": ["American Madness", "American Standoff", "American Dream"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Pie.\n\n\tThe 'brainchild' of writer Adam Herz, 'American Pie' is by far the best film in the three part trilogy.  Often very vulgar, the film also seems to capture something of the essence of high school life, for kids growing up on the 1990s.  Jason Biggs is charming as Jim, while Eddie Kaye Thomas does a notable job playing the quirky Finch.  Other notable performances include Eugene Levy as Jim's awkward but sympathetic father, Seann William Scott as the perverse Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as the wizened high school senior Jessica and Jennifer Coolidge as the very sophisticated mother of Stifler.  It's worth a look if you have a high tolerance for schlock and gross-outs.\r Thanks for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
