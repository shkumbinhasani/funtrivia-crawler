{"id": "109000", "name": "The Film History of Spike Lee Quiz | People Themed | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  People Themed L-R", " Spike Lee"], "questions": [{"text": "Denzel Washington and Spike Lee have partnered in a number of very memorable films over the years.  Which of these Spike Lee films did not feature this collaboration?", "correct": "Jungle Fever", "options": ["Malcolm X", "Mo' Better Blues", "He's Got Game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJungle Fever.\n\n\tWashington did a magnificent job in the hagiography 'Malcolm X', and was also a featured performer in both 'He's Got Game' and 'Mo' Better Blues'.  Spike Lee is fond of using the same actors in numerous films, as some of the other questions in this quiz will make clear! \n"}, {"text": "One of Spike Lee's deeper films, it was inspired by the Million Man March on Washington of 1995.  What was this film, released in 1996, called?", "correct": "Get on the Bus", "options": ["In the Footsteps of the King", "Million Man March", "Trippin' to Washington"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGet on the Bus.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast of this 1996 film included Charles Dutton, Andre Braugher, Bernie Mac, Ossie Davis and Richard Belzer.  The dialogue in this film is excellent, lots of fascinating issues are tackled by the performers.  Surprisingly, Spike Lee does not appear in the film. \n"}, {"text": "In which of Spike Lee's films are we introduced to the character Mars Blackmon, later made famous for a series of commercials?", "correct": "She's Gotta Have It", "options": ["School Daze", "The Answer", "Sarah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's Gotta Have It.\n\n\tReleased in 1986, 'She's Gotta Have It' was Spike Lee's first major production.  Perhaps the greatest legacy of the film was the Mars Blackmon character, played by Lee himself, who went on to be featured in several Nike commercials with Michael Jordan.  Spike Lee, of course, directed these commercials.  Remember the quote... \"Please baby, please baby, please baby, baby baby please!\" (Taken from the film!) \n"}, {"text": "Like many other directors, Spike Lee enjoys employing the same actors for roles in multiple films.  Which of these frequently employed individuals has appeared in the most Spike Lee films?", "correct": "John Turturro", "options": ["Ossie Davis", "Samuel L. Jackson", "Wesley Snipes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Turturro.\n\n\tJohn Turturro has been featured in seven films directed by Spike Lee (one as the voice of the dog in 'Summer of Sam'), while Ossie Davis has appeared in six.  Sam Jackson has appeared in five Lee movies, while Wesley Snipes has been featured in only two.  Incidentally, the actor appearing in the most Spike Lee films...Spike Lee himself! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these actors or actresses made their film debut in a Spike Lee 'Joint'?", "correct": "Rosie Perez", "options": ["Lonette McKee", "Wesley Snipes", "Larry Fishburne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRosie Perez.\n\n\tRosie Perez's first feature film role was in 'Do the Right Thing'.  Wesley Snipes first appeared in the film 'Wildcats', while Larry Fishburne's major film debut was in 'Apocalypse Now'.  Lonette McKee made her debut in the 1976 film 'Sparkle'.  Other film and TV stars who began their careers in Spike Lee films include:  Halle Berry ('Jungle Fever'), Nicholas Turturro ('School Daze') and Martin Lawrence ('Do the Right Thing'). \n"}, {"text": "Not one to skirt controversial topics, which film by Spike Lee has a plot that revolves around interethnic relationships?", "correct": "Jungle Fever", "options": ["Clockers", "Girl 6", "School Daze"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJungle Fever.\n\n\tIn the film 'Jungle Fever', a relationship occurs between the Wesley Snipes character (an African-American) and the Annabella Sciorra character (an Italian-American).  A side romance also develops in the film between the John Turturro character (Caucasian) and a black woman.  Once again, an intellectually stimulating film... though not quite up to the level of 'Do the Right Thing'. \n"}, {"text": "Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo star as the parents of a young girl in a delicate story about growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970s.  What was the name of the film described here?", "correct": "Crooklyn", "options": ["Bamboozled", "Sarah", "Last Hustle in Brooklyn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrooklyn.\n\n\tReleased in 1994, 'Crooklyn' is one of his more underrated films, it lacks the controversy of his more famous endeavors but still involves social commentary.  I believe this film probably relates more to Spike Lee's upbringing than any of his other films, so a personal touch is involved.  No doubt that the young boy with his Knicks tickets and thick glasses is Spike Lee as a youth! \n"}, {"text": "Spike Lee decided to take on the eventful days of summer 1977, in New York City, in his film 'Summer of Sam'.  Which of these actors played the main character Vinny in this film?", "correct": "John Leguizamo", "options": ["Woody Harrelson", "Andy Garcia", "Matt Damon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Leguizamo.\n\n\tAlong with Leguizamo, the film also featured Mira Sorvino, and described the infamous New York summer of 1977 when the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz was active.  Probably not the greatest Spike Lee film, but it has its interesting moments, and includes some very good acting performances. \n"}, {"text": "Spike Lee is an independent filmmaker, which means his films are generally low budget.  With this in mind, which of his films required the largest budget to produce?", "correct": "Malcolm X", "options": ["He Got Game", "Bamboozled", "Do the Right Thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalcolm X.\n\n\tBy far the greatest amount spent on a Spike Lee Joint, Malcolm X required a budget of 34 million.  Amazingly, for such an obvious draw in the theaters, the film studio (Warner Brothers) was hesitant to kick in the full amount required to shoot this movie.  Lee was forced to acquire funding from the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby in order to finish up the project.  Another interesting fact about the film... it's the only feature film that has been allowed to shoot actual footage in Mecca. \n"}, {"text": "I want to end my quiz with a question about Spike Lee's greatest work, 'Do the Right Thing'.  The film revolves around a pizzeria owned by an Italian American family, the patriarch played by Danny Aiello.  What is the name of the Danny Aiello character in 'Do the Right Thing'?", "correct": "Sal", "options": ["Vito", "Pino", "Vinnie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSal.\n\n\tAnd his controversial pizzeria is called 'Sal's Famous Pizzeria'.  If you haven't seen this film, now might be the time to check it out... but beware, it is both disturbing and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it.  Thank you for giving my quiz a try.  I hope you enjoyed it! \n"}]}
