What document did the founders create as the United States' first agreement after it became independent, right after the Revolutionary War?", "correct": "Articles of Confederation", "options": ["Constitution ", "Articles of Confederation  ", "Mayflower Compact ", "Declaration of Independence "], "explanation": "\n\n\nArticles of Confederation.\n\n\tAfter America gained independence from Great Britain, the states formed a government under the Articles of Confederation.

As computers become faster and more powerful, they need to be able to hold larger amounts of memory. ROM (Read Only Memory) is a type of permanent memory that cannot be changed. This type of memory has become a bit outdated by other memory storage devices such as flash memory. Flash memory is kept even after the computer is turned off. RAM (Random Access Memory) is used as temporary storage. There are many other types of computer memory storage, but these are just a few. \n"}, {"text": "Some geographers consider Europe and Asia physically one continent.

What are the measures of the other two angles?  ", "correct": "They would both be 50.", "options": ["There is not enough information to solve this problem.", "They would both be 60.", "One would be 45 and the other would be 55."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey would both be 50.\n\n\tThere are a couple of things that you must know to understand this problem. First, all of the angles of a triangle must add up to 180. You could have eliminated the 60 degrees answer choice because the angles would not add up to 180: 80 + 60 + 60 = 200.\r Secondly, you must understand what an isosceles triangle is. In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are always equal. This would eliminate the answer choice where one would measure 45 degrees while the other would measure 55 degrees. \n"}, {"text": "There are many religions that were taught to ancient civilizations. These religions often became considered mythology. Many had different gods and beliefs, but they also had similarities. Which of these ancient religions is the MOST like Greek mythology?

In \"The Heroes of Olympus\", the author combined Greek and Roman mythologies in the modern day so that they both exist at the same time. Another series by Rick Riordan, \"The Kane Chronicles\", focuses on Egyptian mythology. \n"}, {"text": "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates. What is the name of Microsoft's series of operating systems?", "correct": "Windows", "options": ["Apple ", "Windows ", "IBM", "None of these are true"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWindows.\n\n\tWindows has become  one of the most widely used operating systems, but there are many other manufactures to choose from. Microsoft has released a new version every so often. This is one of the reasons why Bill Gates became very rich. Microsoft, Apple, and other rival companies created operating systems for home use. These ideas were originally rejected by companies like IBM and Xerox because they believed that no one would want a computer for home use. This turned out to be a big mistake since many people own a computer today. \n"}, {"text": "How many chambers does the human heart consist of?", "correct": "4", "options": ["1", "2", "3"], "explanation": "\n\n\n4.\n\n\tThe human heart most closely resembles a sheep heart.
