{"id": "146219", "name": "A Day at an AKC Dog Show Quiz | Dogs | 25 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Animal Trivia", "     Dogs", "Dog Shows"], "questions": [{"text": "Let's follow a dog through his dog show career. I own flat-coated retrievers, so let's say our pup is a flat-coat. How old will my little guy have to be before he can make his show ring debut?", "correct": "6 months", "options": ["3 months", "1 year", "9 months"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6 months.\n\n\tAKC does not allow dogs under 6 months of age at shows due to concerns that they may pick up diseases. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following *can* I do to my flat-coated retriever puppy and still show him?", "correct": "Remove his dewclaws", "options": ["Have a veterinary orthodontist straighten his adult teeth", "Neuter him", "Have his tail set surgically altered"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemove his dewclaws.\n\n\tMany of the sporting breeds have their dewclaws, the small claw high up on the dog's legs, removed soon after birth. This is because they can catch on brush and rip, injuring the dog. However, some breeds, such as Great Pyrenees, must have their dewclaws in order to be shown!\rNo dog that has had any procedure done to improve function or appearance can be shown in AKC shows. In addition, spayed and neutered dogs are not allowed in the regular classes, although many people would like to see this changed. \n"}, {"text": "Shows are divided up into classes. What is the most likely class in which I will enter my 6-month old puppy?", "correct": "6-9 Month Puppy Dogs", "options": ["Open Dogs", "American-Bred Dogs", "Novice Dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\n6-9 Month Puppy Dogs.\n\n\tPuppies can still look and act like puppies in the puppy classes, so that is where most of them are shown. \n"}, {"text": "Looking toward the future, in which class will I most likely enter my pup (which I did not breed) after he is over 18 months old? He's earned a couple of first-place ribbons and points but not his championship. ", "correct": "Open Dogs", "options": ["Bred-by-Exhibitor Dogs", "12-18 Month Dogs", "Novice Dogs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpen Dogs.\n\n\tOpen class is usually the biggest class at any show. Bred-by-Exhibitor, as the name implies, is for dogs bred by the person showing them. Novice is for dogs that haven't won more than three first place ribbons in Novice, one first place ribbon in any other class except the puppy classes, or more than one point toward a championship. 12-18 month dogs is for dogs that are at least 12 months old but not more than 18 months of age. \n"}, {"text": "I want to earn my dog's championship. I do this by earning \"points\" at dog shows. Points are earned according to the number of dogs defeated at shows. How many points does it take to earn an AKC championship?", "correct": "15", "options": ["10", "12", "5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n15.\n\n\tThe more dogs defeated, the more points earned. \n"}, {"text": "Winning at a show can earn me from 0-5 points. What range of points comprises an AKC \"major\"?", "correct": "3-5", "options": ["2-5", "5", "4-5"], "explanation": "\n\n\n3-5.\n\n\tYou have to defeat many more dogs to earn a major than to earn smaller amounts of points. \n"}, {"text": "In addition to acquiring a sufficient number of points, at least how many majors does my dog need to finish his championship?", "correct": "2", "options": ["3", "5", "4"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tFor any dog, of any breed, a championship takes at least 15 points with at least 2 majors. \n"}, {"text": "I enter my puppy in a show and he wins his class. Has he earned any points toward his championship yet?

All of the class winners compete for this award. What is the dog called that is chosen as the best?", "correct": "Winners Dog", "options": ["Best of Breed", "Best of Winners", "Best of Males"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWinners Dog.\n\n\tIn the female classes, correspondingly, Winners Bitch is chosen. \n"}, {"text": "If my puppy wins the competition for best non-champion male dog of his breed, and there are a sufficient number of other dogs competing, has he earned any points? ", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tNow he has his first chance to earn points! Both Winners Dog and Winners Bitch are awarded championship points based on how many other dogs and bitches were in the classes. \n"}, {"text": "Now the top female and male non-champion dogs go back into the ring, along with all of the dogs entered who are already champions.

What has he chosen?", "correct": "Best of Breed", "options": ["Best in Sweepstakes", "Best of Winners", "Best of Opposite Sex"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest of Breed.\n\n\tThis is the class that most people are thinking of when they think of a dog show. \n"}, {"text": "Now the top male and the top female non-champion dogs go head-to-head.

If my flat-coated retriever puppy is chosen as the best representative of his breed, what will be the next class that he competes in?

What is this class called?", "correct": "Best in Show", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest in Show.\n\n\tOf the thousands of dogs entered in a typical show, only one is chosen Best in Show. \r Sorry- \"Best *OF* Show is not a correct answer- at an AKC show, the title is always \"Best In Show.\" \n"}, {"text": "So if a miracle occurs, and my puppy is chosen the best dog of the entire event, does he earn any more points? ", "correct": "Yes, if any dog chosen Best of Breed earned more points than he did", "options": ["Yes, any dog that wins gets an automatic championship", "No", "Only if there were more than 1000 dogs at the event."], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes, if any dog chosen Best of Breed earned more points than he did.\n\n\tFor example, let's say that whippets had a large entry that day, so Best of Breed was worth a whopping 5 points. Now my puppy's total goes from the usual 4 points to 5! \n"}, {"text": "What are shows where only one breed of dog is shown called?", "correct": "Specialties", "options": ["Single breed events", "Breed shows", "Limited-entry shows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpecialties.\n\n\tMost breeds have a specialty once a year. Depending on the breed, many other events may be offered besides conformation- the Flat-Coated Retriever Society of America's specialty, for example, usually also offers obedience, agility, hunt tests, working certificate tests and a field trial. \n"}, {"text": "At some shows, a special class is held for puppies- and sometimes for veteran dogs (over the age of 7) in which the winner of the class earns a monetary prize. What are these events called? ", "correct": "Sweepstakes", "options": ["Puppy Prizes", "Raffles", "Breed Awards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSweepstakes.\n\n\tSweepstakes are often the first events that a puppy attends. Sweepstakes wins do not award any championship points. The monetary prize is very small! \n"}, {"text": "Once a dog becomes a champion, he may still be shown. What are such dogs called?", "correct": "Specials", "options": ["Winners", "Competitors", "Excellents"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpecials.\n\n\tThis has led to a unique dog-show verb- to \"special\"a dog is to show it once it's achieved a championship. \n"}, {"text": "What are the only AKC conformation classes in which spayed or neutered dogs may compete? ", "correct": "Veterans", "options": ["Puppy", "Brace", "Novice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVeterans.\n\n\tVeterans classes are for dogs over 7 years of age- thus past ideal breeding age- so these dogs may be neutered. Like Sweepstakes classes, the winners of these classes don't earn championship points. \n"}, {"text": "In which special class are two dogs of a breed shown? ", "correct": "Brace", "options": ["Double", "Pair", "Two-Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrace.\n\n\tBrace class is another of the \"just for fun\" classes in which no points are awarded.

What are these hired people called?", "correct": "Professional handlers", "options": ["Showers", "Groomers", "Exhibitors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProfessional handlers.\n\n\tProfessional handlers spend their lives traveling from show to show with a caravan of dogs. \n"}, {"text": "At many AKC shows, there are special classes for young people, in which the presentation of the dog, rather than the dog itself, is judged.

", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAlthough dog shows are often thought of as glamor events for the wealthy, most dog show exhibitors are just plain folk who love dogs! \n"}]}
