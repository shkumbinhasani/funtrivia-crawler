That's when Emma interrupts his Spanish class.  They head to Sue's office to find her journal and a suicide (sue-icide) note and rush to her house.\rUpon their arrival, it turns out that Sue's suicide attempt was a flop.  She tried to overdose on gummi vitamins and Vitamin A, but the plan was a failure.  The reason for Sue's depression is the fact that she didn't qualify for another national title and there is no more to do for her and her Cheerios.  Both Will and Emma refuse to pity Sue and this horrible decision. \n"}, {"text": "Brittany, against Rachel's insistence, wears leg warmers on what part of her body?", "correct": "Arms", "options": ["Neck", "Feet", "Torso"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArms.\n\n\tAt school, Sam and Quinn flirt in the hallway and talk about their date on Friday.  Sam is worried that she might be slipping away from him, especially after catching mono a few weeks earlier.  He believed her when she said that she didn't kiss Finn, she performed CPR on him, but it doesn't change the fact that she seems like her mind is elsewhere.  To preserve their relationship, he remembers his dad's idea that women love men who hunt and perform rock and roll.\r...and who's more 'rock and roll' than Justin Bieber?  Combing his hair into a Bieber bowl cut, he tests his new one-man band, 'The Justin Bieber Experience' on a group of young girls and is surprised at how well it works.\rMeanwhile, Rachel, concentrating fully on her career, tries to set a new fashion trend by giving Brittany her allowance and forcing her to adopt a certain style of hers.  This fails--Brittany chooses to wear leg warmers like Rachel, but wears them on her arms instead.  Rachel allows this since it's too cold for Brittany not to wear them with her tank top as long as she claims that she's copying Berry's look. \n"}, {"text": "According to Will, what is the supposed theme of this year's Regionals?", "correct": "Anthem", "options": ["Ballad", "Disco", "Music"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnthem.\n\n\tSue returns to school angrier than normal.  After she starts harassing the Glee kids, Will tries to go to Emma for guidance.  Sue quickly interrupts this meeting holding a noose and Will is forced to try and make her realize the goodness of life.  When he asks her to think of a good moment since her depression began, she recalls her drive to work and the moment she sang along with the radio.  Emma immediately suggests that Sue join the Glee Club.  Neither Will nor Sue are thrilled with the idea, but Emma insists that music is a great pick-me-up.  Will can keep an eye on Sue and it'll bring Sue together with her rivals.  Sue finally agrees to alleviate the depression.\rEveryone in Glee Club is disappointed by their new addition, but Will convinces them that this is a good idea.  In other news, Will announces that New Directions will be facing off against the Warblers as well as Aural Intensity at Regionals and that they'll need to interpret their own anthem for their setlist.  In other words, they need an epic song to cap off their performance. \n"}, {"text": "Who does not want to join 'The Justin Bieber Experience'?", "correct": "Finn", "options": ["Artie", "Mike", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinn.\n\n\tAs soon as Will announces the anthem requirement, Sam steps up to the plate to demonstrate the skills he's honed operating 'The Justin Bieber Experience'.  To everyone's surprise, he sings his way into Bieber's \"Baby\", clearly aiming his lyrics at Quinn.  The girls in the room instantly get into the song while the guys sit in stunned silence.  At the end of the song, Sue claims that she needs to get \"that girl\" on the Cheerios.\rIn the men's bathroom, Mike, Puck, and Artie approach Sam about joining his one-man band and expanding the line-up because all of them want to woo their girlfriends using Bieber's immense powers.  Finn tries to reason that Bieber's songs are aimed at twelve year old girls and says that he'd rather learn better music.  Sam lets the others join in. \n"}, {"text": "To tear the New Directions apart, Sue creates hostility between which two members?", "correct": "Rachel and Mercedes", "options": ["Mike and Tina", "Sam and Finn", "Santana and Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel and Mercedes.\n\n\tRachel is in for her own surprise the next day when all of the girls in the school are wearing leg warmers on their arms as a new fashion statement.  Tina commends Brittany's fashion sense and says that she deserves an award for making her arms so toasty.  Rachel, frustrated, tells Brittany that she'll need to adopt a new Rachel look, specifically 'sexy schoolgirl librarian chic'.\rSue, meanwhile, is back to her old ways.  She writes in her journal about her being dropped behind enemy lines and her plans to sink the New Directions from within by pitting them against one another.  This plan is set into motion when she asks Mercedes to join her in her office.  A short time later, she also speaks with Rachel.  Why?  To insincerely ask for information on how to be a diva and talk horribly about the two of them behind their backs.  She is successfully able to convince them both that a diva-off is in order. \n"}, {"text": "To whom does Sam dedicate the performance of \"Somebody to Love\"?", "correct": "Quinn", "options": ["Santana", "Justin Bieber", "Finn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuinn.\n\n\tWhen Finn starts discussing Friday night plans with Quinn in the choir room, Sam and the guys come in sporting new hairdos.  They decide to perform another Bieber song, \"Somebody to Love\", for their anthem because according to Sam, \"everything Bieber does is epic.\"  Sam dedicates the song to Quinn before they head to the auditorium and hit the stage.  When the song ends, Quinn cancels any possibilities of a date with Finn and heads up to meet Sam.  Puck asks Lauren for her opinion and she gives him a C+.  He begs her for a way to appeal to her and she says she may have a proposition in mind.  After the performance, Santana suggests to Sam that they have a little talk sometime soon.\rFinn is angry with Quinn for choosing Sam over a simple Justin Bieber performance, but she claims that she likes how shameless he is.  She says that she likes how he's an artist. \n"}, {"text": "Lauren wants to sing a solo for Glee Club but she's nervous.  What does Puck suggest to her?", "correct": "To picture everyone in their underwear", "options": ["To pick a song that makes her comfortable", "To take some Vitamin D", "To wrestle beforehand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTo picture everyone in their underwear.\n\n\tPuck speaks with Lauren after her wrestling practice about what to do with their relationship and she suggests that he can be in her good books if he helps her perform a solo for Glee Club.  She is, however, nervous about singing in front of a crowd.  Puck recommends an old trick: picture everyone in their underwear.  She decides that that'll have to do.\rIn the choir room, Sue pumps up Mercedes before the diva-off stating that she wants a bloodbath and Rachel speaks with Brittany about her newest Rachel Berry look.  She suggests that Brittany leave class early simply to walk the halls and be seen and Brittany agrees since teachers have claimed that this would likely improve her grades.  Finn also shows up wearing a Bieber hoodie though Quinn thinks he looks foolish.\rSoon it's time for the diva-off and Rachel and Mercedes both sing to \"Take Me or Leave Me\" from \"Rent\".  Sue's plan fails; both girls start to enjoy their duet and actually appreciate each others' talent even more. \n"}, {"text": "Brittany launches another trend involving sweaters with which of these images woven onto the front?", "correct": "Carousel horse", "options": ["Cat", "Reindeer", "Rocking chair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarousel horse.\n\n\tAfter Will discovers Sue's plan to break the Glee Club down from the inside, he offers to take her somewhere important to him for her big comeback.  That night he leads her to the pediatric cancer ward of the hospital to sing songs for young children.  Sue tries to leave, but Will convinces her to stay and they sing \"This Little Light of Mine\" while he plays the ukulele.  Sue says that she'll never forgive him for it.\rThe next day, Rachel heads to school to find everyone wearing skirts, sweaters with carousel horses on them, and penny loafers.  Tina, Santana, and Quinn are thrilled with their newer, smarter looks and they criticize Rachel for wearing a shirt with reindeer on the front.  Rachel is angered by this and she approaches Brittany who claims that she used the money given to her to hire a publicist; now she's known as the 'trendiest girl in America'.  Brittany says that Rachel isn't a trendsetter and she really has nothing she needs to comeback from in the first place. \n"}, {"text": "Who suggests that New Directions perform \"Sing\" by My Chemical Romance?", "correct": "Sue", "options": ["Will", "Puck", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSue.\n\n\tIn the choir room, Lauren steps up to the plate and introduces her very first solo choice.  Since she knows that she's the hottest girl in the school, this song, \"I Know What Boys Like\" by The Waitresses, would be her anthem.  She has Puck perform on the guitar and Brittany and Tina dance for her and, on Puck's suggestion, pictures the entire class in their underwear before she really gets into it.  Everyone is somewhat weirded-out by the performance (except Puck) but they're also thrilled that she made her big, first solo.\rSam finally has a chat with Santana who, amidst criticisms about his tacky impressions and large mouth, says he's cute.  Her offer?  She will be his mistress.  Sam says he doesn't need one since he's dating Quinn, but Santana says that he needs to face the truth sooner or later and know that she's cheating on him with Finn.\rSue, inspired by the trip to what she calls the 'house of sad', suggests that the group sing an actual anthem.  When Will asks what she's thinking, the club groups together in the auditorium, sans Bieber accessories, to sing My Chemical Romance's \"Sing\". \n"}, {"text": "Who claims that \"Sing\" is not good enough to win it for New Directions at Regionals?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Quinn", "Brittany", "Will"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tQuinn speaks to Sam about borrowing a shirt from him for their date but he says that they can't be together anymore despite what she says she wants; she can't even look him in the eyes and say that she didn't kiss Finn.  He reveals that he and Santana are dating.\rIn the choir room, the group compliments their anthem choice but Rachel says that she doesn't think it'll be enough to win them Regionals--after all, they're against Blaine and Kurt, two powerhouses.  She says they need original music because it's an undisputed advantage.  Will says they'll put it to a vote and she's the only one to stand behind her idea.\rSue returns to speak to Will and she says that she's found something to do as per his inspiration.  Since she has the music in her, she'll be coaching Aural Intensity.\rIn the hallway, Finn says that Rachel is right about original songs.  He says that she needs to write it because if anyone's the trendsetter, it'll be her, and he's behind her all the way.  He says that he likes the Rachel he saw in there today and that she might be making a comeback. \n"}]}
