Cardinal Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies after a trade, which started the entire process of free-agency.  The umpires refused to work the League Championship Series and forced higher salaries.  The world was still in shock over the 1969 'Amazing Mets', who defeated the heavily-favored Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.  There was also a New York Met in 1970, who became the first outfielder in history to win a Gold Glove in both leagues.  Who was he?", "correct": "Tommy Agee", "options": ["Willie Stargell", "Al Kaline", "Carl Yastrzemski"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy Agee.\n\n\tThe others listed never played for the Mets in their career.  Tommy was the 1966 American League Rookie of the Year.  Along with that came a Gold Glove Award for his outfield prowess.  After being traded to the Mets in 1968, he won the glove again in 1970.  Agee retired in 1973 as a St. Louis Cardinal. \n"}, {"text": "1971 was a feel-wierd type of season.  Ron Hunt set a season record for being hit by 50 pitches (HBP), and the Pittsburgh Pirates were the first team to wear form-fitting double-knit uniforms.  It must have helped because they went all the way and won the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, four games to three.  The Orioles knocked out Oakland and a pitcher in the AL Championship Series.  That Oakland pitcher won both the MVP and Cy Young Award in the 1971 season.  Who was he?", "correct": "Vida Blue", "options": ["Randy Jones", "Bob Gibson", "Sandy Koufax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVida Blue.\n\n\tThe others were all Cy Young winners, but none ever pitched in the American League.  Vida Blue at the age of 21, took the American League and baseball by storm with his 24-8, and 1.82 ERA record in the season.  He also blistered 301 batters with strikeouts.  Vida played for 17 seasons, and retired as a San Francisco Giant in 1986. \n"}, {"text": "Baseball fans in 1972 saw former Baltimore Oriole Milt Pappas win his 200th career game, never winning 20 games in a season, and was the first in history to do it.  The Cleveland Indians had a Cy Young winner in the name of Gaylord Perry.  However, the season would start off sour as lemons.  The players went on a general strike for the first time in modern baseball history.  The season would begin 10 days late, and Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled that the games would not be made up.  As a result, the Tigers won their Eastern Division by only one-half game because they played one more game and won than the second place team.  Who did the commissioner's office rob that season?", "correct": "Red Sox", "options": ["White Sox", "Royals", "Twins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed Sox.\n\n\tThe others were not in the Eastern Division.  Detroit finished the shortened season with a record of 86-70, while Boston was 85-70.  The commissioner's office made no attempt to remedy the situation.  The Tigers went on to lose the AL Championship against Oakland, who went on to win their first of three consecutive World Series. \n"}, {"text": "Every portion of baseball around the world was still mourning the death of Pirate great, Roberto Clemente, who was killed on a humanitarian plane mission on December 31, 1972.  The 1973 season was an interesting one also as the American League instituted the Designated Hitter rule, allowing a regular batter to bat in place of the pitcher.  The National League refused to accommodate this rule and left the American League by itself with this decision.  Ron Blomberg of the Yankees was the first designated hitter in history while playing for the New York Yankees.  Also in 1973, there was a future Yankee becoming the 1973 World Series MVP in 'October' while playing for the Oakland Athletics.  Who was this player?", "correct": "Reggie Jackson", "options": ["Harmon Killebrew", "Frank Robinson", "Bob Uecker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReggie Jackson.\n\n\tThe others never played for either Oakland or the Yankees.  Nicknamed 'Mr. October', Reggie Jackson had a stellar season in 1973 for the Athletics, mainly by hitting another 32 home runs in the season.  When it came to World Series time, Reggie showed his October madness by batting .310 with six RBIs. \n"}, {"text": "1974 saw Fergie Jenkins of the Texas Rangers become the last pitcher to show up in a batting order, negating the Designated Hitter rule in the American League.  In his last game batting in the American League, Jenkins broke up a no-hitter with a single late in the game, and would go on to win his 25th game of the season.  Also from the Rangers was the 1974 American League MVP.  Born in Long Beach, California, this golden boy was voted in over Oakland's Joe Rudi, Sal Bando, and Reggie Jackson.  Who was this Ranger?", "correct": "Jeff Burroughs", "options": ["Bill Russell", "Steve Garvey", "Dave Concepcion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJeff Burroughs.\n\n\tNone of the other greats played in the American League.  Burroughs in his fifth season with the franchise, hit 25 home runs with a .301 batting average for the Rangers.  The Rangers finished five games behind AL West winners Oakland A's.  The A's went on to defeat the Orioles in the AL Championship Series, then the Dodgers in the World Series. \n"}, {"text": "After earning the Cy Young Award with Oakland in 1974, Jim 'Catfish' Hunter was the first baseball star who won his 'declared' free-agency and began the 1975 season with his new team.  Hunter responded with tying for the most wins in the American League with 23, with the Orioles' Jim Palmer.  Which team did Catfish play for who finished as runner-up to the Cy Young Award in 1975?", "correct": "New York Yankees", "options": ["Minnesota Twins", "Detroit Tigers", "Seattle Mariners"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York Yankees.\n\n\tAthletics' owner Charles O. Finley was still being a scrooge after winning three consecutive World Series from 1972-1974.  He refused to deal with player's contracts.  Catfish worked out a deal with the Yankees that he was happy with, then played his final five seasons in the pinstripes, retiring in 1979.  He was a Hall of Fame inductee in 1987. \n"}, {"text": "1976 saw Cincinnati Reds player Dan Driessen, become the first player in history to serve as a designated hitter in a World Series game.  Which National League team won the 1976 World Series?", "correct": "Cincinnati Reds", "options": ["Los Angeles Dodgers", "Philadelphia Phillies", "San Francisco Giants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCincinnati Reds.\n\n\tThe Reds literally had an all-star cast of Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, Dave Concepcion, George Foster, Tony Perez, Joe Morgan, Ken Griffey, and others.  Some would question that this team was more powerful than the 1927 Yankees who won 110 games in their season.  The Reds easily skunked the Yankees in the World Series, four games to none, with catcher Johnny Bench winning the MVP Award. \n"}, {"text": "Baseball fans saw Patty Livingston, who was the last surviving member of the new American League in 1901, die in 1977.  Fans also saw the American League grow to 14 teams with the addition of the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays.  Neither team had a starting pitcher finish over .500.  The Blue Jays did however have a former Dodger and Expo first baseman/right fielder, who was Toronto's designated hitter in 1977, and lead the club with 19 home runs in the season.  Who was he?", "correct": "Ron Fairly", "options": ["Will Clark", "Vince Coleman", "Denny Neagle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon Fairly.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Blue Jays, Expos, or Dodgers in their careers, and had not started their Major League endeavors yet.

Ron Fairly was born in Georgia, but went to Jordan High School in Long Beach, California.

Gaylord shined in this season with a 21-6 record, and topping Burt Hooten and Vida Blue for the Cy Young.  Perry retired in 1983 and was inducted into the Hall in 1991. \n"}, {"text": "1979 ended with a strange twist.  It was the first time in history that two National League players were 'co-selected' MVPs for the season.  One player was Keith Hernandez of the Cardinals.  Who was the other Pirate?", "correct": "Willie Stargell", "options": ["Al Kaline", "Jerry Adair", "Wally Bunker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWillie Stargell.\n\n\tThe others listed were all American League players in their careers.
