{"id": "87965", "name": "Interesting Info Multiple Choice Quiz | Interesting Information | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", " Quiz Creation Guidelines", " Interesting Information"], "questions": [{"text": "Agatha is writing a quiz on her favorite band, U2. In her interesting info for a question about their lead guitarist, she writes, \"Oh .... my ... goodness ... The Edge is the worst guitarist in history. Adam can strum sooo much better.\" Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tNot only is Agatha dead wrong about The Edge's musical skills, but there's also no information in this \"interesting info\"! All that she writes is her opinion, which probably won't really enlighten the players. She's perfectly free to state her opinion there, of course, but this is a trivia site - she's got to include some facts as well. For example, she could give information about The Edge's personal life or tell about a chord he might have missed in a live performance of \"Walk On.\" \n"}, {"text": "Cameron is Angelina Jolie's biggest fan, so naturally he's penning a quiz about her for the Celebrities category. He adds this info to one question: \"in fact, this tattoo caused problems when angelina was filming Tomb raider, where she had to wear sleeveless shirts for much of the shoot.\" Is this an acceptable interesting info section as written?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAll the normal Quizzyland rules - spelling, grammar, capitalization, etc. - apply to interesting info as well as the questions and answers. Many people, like Cameron, are surprised by this - but the fact is that the interesting info is just as important to the quiz as anything else! And if you look closely at what Cameron wrote, you'll see that \"Tomb Raider\" is not in quotation marks - as all movie titles are required to be -- and that several words that should be capitalized aren't. \n"}, {"text": "Lola, who's always been interested in the history of slavery throughout the world, is writing a quiz about Harriet Tubman. For one question asking about Ms. Tubman's nickname (answer: Moses), she gives this info: \"Yes, this amazing woman was nicknamed Moses because she led her people to freedom just like the Biblical figure. In fact, in her 1955 biography of Tubman, Ann Petry says that 'Let my people go!' was a slogan of hers.\" Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIt's true that we prefer interesting info that doesn't repeat the question and answer - but Lola gives plenty of additional facts, and only repeats herself for emphasis. There would be a problem if she had written the first phrase only (\"Yes, this amazing woman was nicknamed Moses\"): not only does it not give any information that wasn't already in the question and answer, but about the only new thing it says (that Ms. Tubman was \"amazing\") is an opinion! \n"}, {"text": "Emil is writing a Movies quiz on the work of his favorite actor, Tom Cruise. In the interesting info for one question, he writes \"Yep, Mr. Cruise is all over the cinema this summer - not only does he star in Spielberg's 'Minority Report,' but he also makes a cameo appearance in 'Austin Powers 3: Goldmember.'\" Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tTake another look at the very first sentence: \"Yep, Mr. Cruise is all over the cinema this summer.\" The problem is that, hopefully, Emil's quiz will still be online at FunTrivia for years and years to come - and the phrase \"this summer\" won't mean the same thing in, say, three years' time. This info is date-dependent and will go stale as time goes by, so Emil should rephrase it: \"Mr. Cruise was all over the cinema in the summer of 2002 ...\" \n"}, {"text": "Guinevere, writing a quiz on her favorite scenes from a certain gritty mystery novel, decides to use some lines from the book in her interesting info. Unfortunately, one of these quotes includes a word that she knows won't really work at a family website like FunTrivia.com. What can she do to make her quote acceptable?", "correct": "She can use ellipsis ( . . . ) to replace the offending word - or she can just choose a different quote.", "options": ["She can use asterisks ( * * * ) to replace the offending word  - or she can just choose a different quote.", "She can replace the vowels with asterisks - for example, if the word were \"rutabaga\" she could write \"r*t*b*g*\".", "She can write the quote and just leave out the offending word, as if it had never existed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe can use ellipsis ( . . . ) to replace the offending word - or she can just choose a different quote.\n\n\tAt FunTrivia, most swear or curse words are not allowed, although in some cases exceptions are made. (For example, feel free to refer to Hell in a Religion quiz - but don't tell your players to go there!) We don't even let you replace some or all of the letters with stars or dashes, since that's too close to the original word when you consider it from the standpoint of a curious eight-year-old.But when you're writing out a quote, you can't just remove a word willy-nilly either - that changes the quote and makes it inaccurate. The solution is to replace the word with ellipsis ( . . . ) which signify that a word or phrase is being left out, but says nothing about what was removed.Or, of course, Guinevere could simply select a less hard-boiled quote to spice up her quiz. \n"}, {"text": "Archibald has just finished a long quiz on the Impressionist Movement, but when he saves it, he notices a warning next to Question 4: \"(we encourage you to add interesting info to this question)\". He immediately goes back to look at Question 4, but try as he might, he can't think of anything to add: Pierre-Auguste Renoir's \"Girl with a Hoop\" just speaks for itself. So he writes \"n/a\" for \"not applicable\" in the interesting info blank and submits his quiz to the editors. Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tImagine that you're taking Archibald's quiz, tripping along happily from question to question. You click \"submit\" and check your answers. Monet, Degas, Manet - you're on a roll! But then it happens - you get to Question 4, and where some interesting info should be, there's a little note saying \"n/a.\" What does that mean, \"not applicable\"? Does it mean that \"Girl with a Hoop\" is so boring that there's no information about it, at all, anywhere? Should you cancel your trip to beautiful Washington, DC, where you were going to see the painting? The momentum of the quiz is lost, the player is unnecessarily confused, and Archibald will get destroyed in the rankings.It's far better to check whether your category guidelines will allow you to leave the interesting info blank for a question or two if you need to ... if not, bite the bullet and do some research. \"N/A\" is neither interesting nor information; it's worse than a blank interesting info box. \n"}, {"text": "Etheline, writing a \"Star Trek\" quiz, includes a question about that hilarious scene when Scotty punched out a Klingon who insinuated not that the Enterprise was a garbage scow, but that \"it should be hauled away _as_ garbage.\" When it comes time to write the interesting info, though, she can't remember what episode - or even what season - it came from. What should she do?", "correct": "She should do some research, on the Internet or in a library, find out the title of the episode, and write it in.", "options": ["She should write, \"I can't remember the name of this episode, so if any of you do, please send me a message and I'll add it in.\"", "She should write, \"I can't remember the name of this episode, but it was SO funny!\"", "She should fudge it and say \"This episode was very funny,\" never mentioning the title."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe should do some research, on the Internet or in a library, find out the title of the episode, and write it in.\n\n\tIt wouldn't be very fair of Etheline to expect the players to do her research for her - she's the one writing the quiz, after all! And \"I can't remember the name of the episode\" is not only uninformative, but would probably sour the players on the rest of the quiz - they're taking a quiz to test their knowledge or to learn new things, and here the quizwriter can't be bothered to look up some basic information.Meanwhile, they'll see right through a non-info blurb like \"This was funny,\" which offers no information other than Etheline's opinion. If Etheline sends that quote through a standard search engine or breaks out a Star Trek encyclopedia, though, she'll quickly find that the episode was \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" from the second season - and her players will appreciate it, because now they know which videotape they should rent. \n"}, {"text": "Hubert, writing a quiz about American pro wrestling, includes a simple question about Triple H. In fact, it's so simple that Hubert doesn't really feel that he can respect anyone who gets it wrong, so he writes in the interesting info box: \"You must be stupid if you don't get this! Triple H originated this move in an epic 2000 match.\" Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tWhat Hubert doesn't realize is that the players, even the ones who don't know very much about Triple H or pro wrestling, are not his enemies! All kinds of people take FunTrivia quizzes. Some take quizzes in order to test their knowledge of subjects they already know well; others take quizzes in order to learn about fields they've never really looked at before. Getting any question wrong doesn't make someone stupid, and there's _never_ a good reason to insult the players, in an interesting info box or anywhere else. \n"}, {"text": "Henrietta is writing a quiz to help herself study for an upcoming exam. The question asks which of four nations was an enemy of the Allies during World War II, and she correctly gives the answer as Germany. In her interesting info, though, Henrietta writes, \"World War II began in 1898 when a German battleship suspiciously exploded in Santiago, Chile. German newspaper barons insisted that the Jews were responsible, and before anyone knew what was happening Hitler was up there demanding lebensraum. The entire world was drawn into horrible conflict because of what was probably an accident.\" Is this acceptable interesting info?", "correct": "No; it's factually incorrect.", "options": ["No. It's factually incorrect, but that doesn't matter - the most important thing is that the word \"lebensraum\" should be in quotation marks. It doesn't matter whether the facts are right, as long as the grammar is.", "Yes; it's factually incorrect, but that doesn't matter because the question and answer are correct.", "Yes. Even though it's technically factually incorrect, Henrietta must know what she's talking about, since she used \"lebensraum\" in a sentence. FunTrivia editors are very impressed by German."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo; it's factually incorrect.\n\n\tHenrietta needs to do some more studying before she takes her exam! Interesting info is fact-based, and it's just as important as the rest of the quiz - the editors hold it to the same high standards of accuracy as the rest of the site. It's true that German is a fine language, but the editors are much more impressed by correct information.(The exploding battleship in 1898 was actually the U.S.S. Maine, in Havana, Cuba and it was American newspaper barons who ignited a war with Spain over it. The Spanish-American War ended quickly, with the U.S. taking over the Philippines and several other former Spanish colonies.) \n"}, {"text": "Floyd is just putting the finishing touches on his Shakespeare quiz when he realizes he doesn't really know anything about \"The Winter's Tale.\" He's anxious to finally submit it, though, so he reaches for his encyclopedia and types in its two-sentence analysis. Is this acceptable interesting info? ", "correct": "No - it's plagiarism, plain and simple.", "options": ["Yes - it's true that it isn't his own words, but it isn't plagiarism because encyclopedias are there for everyone to use.", "Yes - plagiarism is only wrong if you get caught. Plus, he just wanted to get finished, and he probably wouldn't have done as good a job anyway.", "No - interesting info should be at least three sentences."], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo - it's plagiarism, plain and simple.\n\n\tThere's no Quizzyland-wide minimum limit for interesting info, but Floyd is in trouble nonetheless. After all, he's attached his user name to someone else's words: by submitting it, he claims it as his own. That's stealing, whether the editors catch it or not - and we spot plagiarism more often than you'd think.And the source doesn't matter - plagiarism is plagiarism, no matter if the words are taken from a book, an encyclopedia, or a homework assignment. Floyd should have done some more research so that he could write his own interesting info, and if he still had to use anyone else's words, he should have used quotation marks and cited the source. \n"}]}
