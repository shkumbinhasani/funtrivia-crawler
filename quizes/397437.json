{"id": "397437", "name": "Seasoned Vet: Gen. Thunderbolt Ross Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Company Themed"], "questions": [{"text": "Winner of an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, which actor debuted the character of Gen. Ross in \"The Incredible Hulk\"?", "correct": "William Hurt", "options": ["Lou Ferrigno", "Edward Norton", "Tim Roth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Hurt.\n\n\tAll four actors were in the movie.\r Hurt won his Academy Award for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" in 1986. He was nominated in the same category in '87 and '88 for \"Children of a Lesser God\" and \"Broadcast News\". In 2006 he was nominated again, this time as a supporting actor for \"A History of Violence\". \n"}, {"text": "Gen. Ross has a daughter. What is her name? ", "correct": "Betty", "options": ["Natalie", "Natasha", "Pepper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetty.\n\n\tBetty Ross was Bruce Banner's one-time fiance. In \"The Incredible Hulk\" she was portrayed by Liv Tyler.\r Banner, as the Hulk, injured her and because of that ran off, setting off the events of the movie. Gen. Ross didn't like Banner, and tried to have him jailed several times. \n"}, {"text": "In the short film \"The Consultant\" where did Gen. Ross meet Tony Stark?", "correct": "In a bar", "options": ["In a prison", "S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters", "Avengers Mansion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a bar.\n\n\tThe entire short was about Phil Coulson and Jasper Sitwell trying to figure out how to fulfill their duty of asking for Emil Blonksy's release from prison into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and at the same time, have Gen. Ross deny the request. They settled on sending Tony, as the titular character, who Ross didn't get along with.\r The scene with Tony and Ross was set in an unnamed bar where Ross was smoking and drinking, apparently to drown his sorrows after the events of \"The Incredible Hulk\". By the end of the short, Tony bought the bar and scheduled it to be torn down.\r The short was set after \"Iron Man\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" but before \"Thor\". It was released on the DVD with \"Thor\". It was the first of several short films that fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \n"}, {"text": "By the time of \"Captain America: Civil War\", Ross returned to the MCU, this time as the U.S. President.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tBy the time of that movie, Ross had become Secretary of State, not president. It was his first appearance since \"The Consultant\" short, and first in a feature film since \"The Incredible Hulk\".\r He was the one pushing for the Sokovia Accords. \n"}, {"text": "Gen. Ross was on the side of forcing superheroes to register with the government after damage was done in both New York and what fictional country?", "correct": "Sokovia", "options": ["Kandor", "Krypton", "Bludhaven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSokovia.\n\n\tKrypton, Bludhaven and Kandor are all cities from DC Comics. Ross is a character in comics and movies based on Marvel Comics.\r The Sokovia Accords called for the registration of all superheroes, and for them to release their secret identities to the government. Ross pushed for that after the events in the two movies prior to \"Civil War\" and caused the split between the two factions of the team. \n"}, {"text": "Which two heroes did Ross put on house arrest for refusing to register?", "correct": "Clint Barton and Scott Lang", "options": ["Natasha Romanov and Bruce Banner", "Tony Stark and James Rhodes", "Carol Danvers and Peter Parker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClint Barton and Scott Lang.\n\n\tLang's house arrest was a big part of \"Ant-Man & The Wasp\", but the character of Gen. Ross didn't appear. Barton's house arrest, though likely the reason he missed the entire \"Avengers: Infinity War\" movie, was less obvious. In the opening scene of \"Avengers: Endgame\" the ankle monitor can be seen on his leg.\r During a cameo appearance in \"Infinity War\" Ross tried to demand Captain America and others be arrested for violating the Sokovia Accords. \r The house arrest negotiations were part of the ending of \"Captain America: Civil War\" as both Clint and Scott turned themselves in, rather than going on the run with Captain America and his team. \n"}, {"text": "Which original Avenger did Gen. Ross not get along with in any of his on-screen appearances? ", "correct": "Iron Man", "options": ["Thor", "Hulk", "Spider-Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIron Man.\n\n\tWhile Ross initially didn't like the Hulk, and at times outright hated Bruce Banner, they were on the same side by the end of \"The Incredible Hulk\" movie. Ross even gave the order to his soldiers to help Hulk fight off Abomination, and eventually allowed Hulk to escape, rather than taking him into custody.\r He had very little interaction with Thor or Spider-Man in any of the first three phases of the MCU. \r Tony Stark on the other hand, was always at odds with Ross, even when they worked together. In \"The Consultant\" short film Tony was picked specifically to get Ross to not agree to a deal.\r When Tony sided with the government about the Sokovia Accords, he ended up working with Ross, but their on-screen interactions still showed them antagonizing each other. Tony also purposely did things against Ross' orders and refused to give him information at times. At one point Ross even warned Tony that he should have been arrested while they were working together. \n"}, {"text": "Which webseries was Gen. Ross featured in?", "correct": "WHiH Newsfront", "options": ["Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot ", "WHiH Newsfront ", "Ant-Man: Under Arrest", "Hulk: Becoming a Genius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWHiH Newsfront.\n\n\t\"WHiH Newsfront\" ran for two seasons on the Marvel Youtube Channel. The minisodes were used to market both \"Ant-Man\" and \"Captain America: Civil War\". While no new footage of Gen. Ross was used in either season, he appeared in archive footage as a way of telling the \"news\" of the time.\r \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot\" mentioned him by name, but he never appeared in the series. \r The other two options are not real shows. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the program Gen. Ross, his daughter and Bruce Banner were working on to attempt to recreate the circumstances that created Capt. America?", "correct": "Bio-Tech Force Enhancement Project", "options": ["Gamma Generation", "Super Soldier II", "Marvelous Man"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBio-Tech Force Enhancement Project.\n\n\tGen. Ross was in charge of the project, but it was scientists Betty and Bruce who were doing the lion's share of the work. They were trying to recreate the lost formula that had turned Steve Rogers into a super soldier. An accident in the lab ended up creating the Hulk. \n"}, {"text": "Was Gen. Ross killed (on screen) as part of the \"snap\" in \"Avengers: Infinity War\"?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt was never shown on screen if he survived the \"snap\". He was in \"Infinity War\" before the snap, and didn't show up in \"Endgame\" until after events that brought back some characters. So based solely on screen appearances, it was never shown if he survived or not.\r Directors Joe and Anthony Russo talked about his daughter Betty being one of those killed as well in several interviews after \"Infinity War\" was released, but that also didn't happen on screen. \r Other notables that were either shown to die, or were listed on the memorial include: Bucky Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, Mantis. Drax, Peter Quill, Stephen Strange, Peter Parker, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, Hope van Dyne, Sif, Shuri, Erik Selvig, Sharon Carter, Laura Barton, Cooper Barton, Lila Barton, Nathaniel Barton, Flash Thompson, Betty Brant, Ned Leeds, Maggie Lang and many others. \n"}]}
