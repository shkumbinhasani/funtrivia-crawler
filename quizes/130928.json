{"id": "130928", "name": "\"The Eagle of the Ninth\" - Rosemary Sutcliff Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Kid Lit Authors L - Z", "S Authors"], "questions": [{"text": "From which part of the Roman Empire did most of Marcus' cohort come when he first marches into Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter)?", "correct": "Gaul", "options": ["Spain", "Egypt", "Etruscan Italy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGaul.\n\n\tMarcus himself thinks of his home as being amongst the Etruscan hills but his men are from Gaul(modern-day France).He is a cohort commander, one of the middle ranks in the Roman army. \n"}, {"text": "How does Marcus win a hunting spear from Cradoc one of the leading British hunters in the nearby settlement?", "correct": "He proves himself by driving Cradoc's chariot horses successfully.", "options": ["He outruns Cradoc in a foot-race up a long hill.", "In an archery contest he gets most arrows in the bull.", "He defeats Cradoc in a practice sword fight."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe proves himself by driving Cradoc's chariot horses successfully.\n\n\tCradoc's team of black horses are driven successfully by Marcus the first time he tries even though he is more used to the heavier Roman chariot. This appreciation of horses seems to bring the two men together in a way that defies their different racial and cultural backgrounds. But Cradoc is still one of the leaders of the rebellion. \n"}, {"text": "In this story how did the Romans signal to the next fort in the line that they were under attack?", "correct": "They sent up smoke signals.", "options": ["They used an early form of semaphore signalling.", "They sent messengers on fast horses.", "They used the sun to flash messages on mirrors."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey sent up smoke signals.\n\n\tUnfortunately for Marcus the system of smoke signals could only work when the weather was clear and the British chose to attack when the countryside was covered in \"mizzle\" - a mixture of mist and drizzle. \n"}, {"text": "How does Marcus sustain the leg injury that eventually means he is unfit for service in the Roman army?", "correct": "Marcus deliberately leaps into the way of Cradoc's chariot.", "options": ["Marcus is hit by an arrow in his calf.", "Marcus is wounded by a spear thrust from Cradoc.", "Marcus is under the wall of the fort when it collapses."], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarcus deliberately leaps into the way of Cradoc's chariot.\n\n\tThe only way in which he can save his men and give them a chance of getting back inside the fort is to stop the chariot that threatens to mow them all down. He leaps up and manages to send the chariot horses into \"instant chaos\". In the ensuing crash his leg gets mangled. \n"}, {"text": "What was the first thing that Marcus noted about his uncle Aquila's appearance?", "correct": "He was huge.", "options": ["He had a large scar down the side of his face.", "He was very thin.", "He had thick wavy black hair."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was huge.\n\n\tAquila's is Marcus's father's elder brother. Very soon Marcus learns to stop making comparisons in his mind between the two men and think only of Aquila as Aquila because of his formidable personality. Aquila is both lacking a scar and is bald. It is his enormous size rather than any fatness that makes an impression on Marcus. \n"}, {"text": "How does Marcus acquire his body slave Esca who later becomes his friend?", "correct": "He saves him from death after defeat in the arena.", "options": ["He buys him from a rich old woman.", "Esca recuses him from drowning in the river.", "Uncle Aquila gives Esca to him to help with his leg."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe saves him from death after defeat in the arena.\n\n\tEsca takes part in the traditional gladiatorial contest between the man with the trident and the fishnet and the man armed with a sword.

Marcus gets all the crowd to put their thumbs up and saves Esca from death. \n"}, {"text": "What sign does Esca carry on him that he is not a freeman but a slave?", "correct": "His ear has been clipped.", "options": ["He has been tattooed with the slave letter \"S\"", "He has been branded with the slave letter \"S\" .", "He has a chain attached to one of his wrists."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis ear has been clipped.\n\n\tEar clipping was the most usual method in Britain. In order to live as a free man once again Esca would have to run away from all society whether Roman or British. The Romans would try to recapture him and he would feel ashamed to show his clipped ear to his own people. \n"}, {"text": "What name do they give to the young wolf-cub that Esca brings back from the hunt?", "correct": "Cub", "options": ["Maximus", "Rex", "Regina"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCub.\n\n\tMarcus realises that Esca has brought the cub as a possible pet to comfort him as he lies there trying to recover from his injury. He also knows that Esca has been treated badly by the Roman officer who was also on the hunt. Marcus tries to show that he regards Esca as something much more than property. \n"}, {"text": "What colour is Cottia's hair?", "correct": "the colour of red Baltic amber", "options": ["the colour of the golden corn in the Etruscan fields", "the colour of the silver muzzle of a fox", "the colour of the black grapes on the vine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe colour of red Baltic amber.\n\n\tCottia is a member of the Iceni tribe but her family have adapted completely to Roman ways.

The gold bracelet would betray him as a Roman and so he cannot carry it. He also gives her Cub to look after whilst he is away. \n"}, {"text": "To which god does Marcus build a fire and sacrifice his little olive-wood bird?", "correct": "Mithras, the light of the sun", "options": ["Jupiter, the chief of the gods", "Sol, god of the Sun", "Mercury, the god of travellers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMithras, the light of the sun.\n\n\tIt was not unusual for Roman army officers to belong to the cult of Mithras.

He claims that he learned it at a Roman camp but that he is not a deserter from the legion. However, Marcus notices the clear mark of the Roman helmet still on his face and Guern has to admit the truth. \n"}, {"text": "During which tribal festival do Marcus and Esca steal back the eagle?", "correct": "The Feast of the New Spears", "options": ["Beltane", "The Festival of the Horned Moon", "The Feast of the Hunters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Feast of the New Spears.\n\n\tFor a while Marcus and Esca try to avoid suspicion by delaying their journey to the south. The eagle is hidden because they know they will be under suspicion and searched. Unfortunately when he secretly returns for it Esca drops a ring-brooch that gives the game away. The story now becomes a flat-out race for Hadrian's Wall. \n"}, {"text": "What happens to the eagle in the end?", "correct": "It is placed in a hiding place under Uncle Aquila's house.", "options": ["It is retaken by the tribesmen and returned to its sacred cave.", "It is returned to Rome and kept in the Senate House.", "It is taken to Londinium and the 9th legion is reformed."], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt is placed in a hiding place under Uncle Aquila's house.\n\n\tThe Roman authorities are glad that the eagle has lost its potential as a rallying point for the northern tribes to rebel. However, they want the whole story covered up and there is no possibility of the \"lost legion\" being reformed for there was too much scandal connected with what had happened to them. It is better off buried. \n"}]}
