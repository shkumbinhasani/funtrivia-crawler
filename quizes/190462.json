{"id": "190462", "name": "\"Challenge of the Super Friends,\" Season One Quiz | Television | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television A-C", "c.. Ca-Cm"], "questions": [{"text": "As the opening theme of the show - possibly the greatest cartoon theme song of all time - begins, we hear the narrator say, \"Banded together from remote galaxies are thirteen of the most sinister villains of all time: The Legion of Doom!\"  How many of those thirteen villains were, in fact, born or created on a planet other than Earth?", "correct": "2 & two", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n2 & two.\n\n\tBraniac was a sentient computer from the planet Colu, and Sinestro is a native of the planet Korugar.  Every other member of the Legion of Doom was from Earth!  \r Bizarro may have later MADE a home for himself on the cubical \"Bizarro World,\" but he was created by Lex Luthor right here on good old Earth.  Solomon Grundy is a zombie who was created on Earth.  Gorilla Grodd's home, Gorilla City, is an unusual place, to be sure, but it's located in Africa.  In other words, \"banded together from remote galaxies\" is pushing it a little bit.  =) \n"}, {"text": "Now on to the actual episodes.  In the very first episode, \"Wanted: The Super Friends,\" The Legion of Doom traps the entire JLA in a cage that is sent on a collision course with the sun.  Which Super Friend manages to save the entire team from this predicament?", "correct": "Wonder Woman", "options": ["Superman", "Hawkman", "Flash"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWonder Woman.\n\n\tWonder Woman's telepathic control over her magic lasso is not affected by the \"paralysis ray\" that has everyone locked into place.  She uses the lasso to alter the trajectory of the propulsion system of the cage, allowing them to avoid the sun and get back to Earth. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Invasion of the Fearians,\" the Legion of Doom assists some three-headed aliens from Venus in altering the climate of the planet Earth.  Which member of the Legion was the initial contact for the Fearians, and acts as their \"point man\" throughout the episode?", "correct": "Captain Cold", "options": ["Braniac", "Sinestro", "Toyman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Cold.\n\n\tIt's never explained how Captain Cold, an Earthling named Len Snart, came to be in contact with a race of Venusians, but he's the one who introduces the Fearians' plot to the Legion. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The World's Deadliest Game,\" a number of Super Friends are made unwilling participants in a game designed by Toyman.  Which Super Friend is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Green Lantern", "options": ["Hawkman", "Black Vulcan", "Wonder Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen Lantern.\n\n\tHawkman, Wonder Woman, and Black Vulcan are whisked away and placed in a number of bizarre death traps, the most memorable being a giant pinball machine! \n"}, {"text": "Numerous Super Friends find themselves trapped in the past in \"The Time Trap.\"  Who comes up with the ingenious idea of programming a JLA communicator to emit an emergency signal, and burying it under the future site of the Hall of Justice?", "correct": "Aquaman", "options": ["Batman", "Apache Chief", "Robin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAquaman.\n\n\tAnd here you thought he was only good for talking to fish.  \r This \"plant a message for people in the future\" gimmick has also been used in time travel-related movies like \"Back to the Future Part II\".  Remember how Marty McFly received a telegram literally seconds after Doc Brown was apparently incinerated? \n"}, {"text": "In \"Trial of the Super Friends,\" the Legion of Doom confiscates several items from certain members of the JLA.  Which is NOT among them?", "correct": "Hawkman's wings", "options": ["Wonder Woman's magic lasso", "Batman's utility belt", "Green Lantern's power ring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkman's wings.\n\n\tGreen Lantern, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Robin are put on \"trial\" at the Hall of Doom.  Their weapons are snatched by the Legion.  Hawkman is not one of the heroes placed on trial. \n"}, {"text": "The Legion of Doom uses the all-powerful titular object in \"The Monolith of Evil\" to alter landmarks all over the planet Earth.  In what city does the final confrontation between the JLA and the Legion take place?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Metropolis", "Washington, DC", "Gotham City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tThe Legion uses the Monolith of Evil to alter the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center, and the Empire State Building. \n"}, {"text": "Four members of the Legion of Doom are transformed into giants in \"The Giants of Doom.\"  Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Lex Luthor", "options": ["Captain Cold", "Bizarro", "Toyman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLex Luthor.\n\n\tCaptain Cold, Toyman, Bizarro, and Sinestro are turned into giants.  Oddly, the \"formula\" used to enlarge the villains was devised by Bizarro, who probably doesn't have the chemistry know-how to make a Pop-Tart.  Oh, well. \n"}, {"text": "The Legion of Doom uses a time machine to interfere with the pasts of several JLA members in my favorite episode of the season, \"Secret Origins of the Super Friends.\"  Three Super Friends are, in fact, wiped from existence in this episode.  Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Batman", "options": ["Green Lantern", "Superman", "Wonder Woman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman.\n\n\tSince the folks at Hanna-Barbera weren't even allowed to show one character HITTING another, they certainly couldn't have depicted the \"secret origin\" of Batman, which began with his parents being brutally murdered before his eyes. \n"}, {"text": "Gorilla Grodd takes the spotlight in \"Revenge on Gorilla City,\" as he leads the Legion of Doom in an attack against his former home.  Where is Gorilla City located?", "correct": "Africa", "options": ["In the center of the Earth", "Antarctica", "On the surface of the moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfrica.\n\n\tGorilla City, a society of super-intelligent apes, can be found on the continent of Africa...hidden behind a sophisticated invisibility shield, of course. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Swamp of the Living Dead,\" the Legion of Doom finally succeeds in rendering all eleven Super Friends permanently incapacitated.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tYup!  The LOD manages to trap all eleven Super Friends in stasis chambers deep beneath their swamp, presumably for all time.  Unfortunately for the villains, the undead army that they come to command turns against them, and the Legion \"resurrects\" the Super Friends so that the heroes can protect them from the rebellious zombies!  (Man, talk about a bunch of wimps.) \n"}, {"text": "The Legion of Doom decide to sidestep the Super Friends altogether in \"Conquerors of the Future,\" using their time travel capabilities to take over the Earth of a distant century.  In what century does the Legion temporarily succeed in achieving global domination?", "correct": "the 40th century", "options": ["the 30th century", "the 35th century", "the 45th century"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe 40th century.\n\n\tSpecifically, the Legion travels to the year 3984 and takes over the world...until the Super Friends show up, of course. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Final Challenge,\" five Super Friends and five members of the Legion of Doom are kidnapped and forced to compete against each other at the whim of an interdimensional being who apparently loves games.  Which match is NOT forced upon the characters in this episode?", "correct": "Green Lantern vs. Sinestro", "options": ["Superman vs. Bizarro", "Apache Chief vs. Scarecrow", "Batman vs. Riddler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreen Lantern vs. Sinestro\n\n\tGL and his arch-enemy from Qward are not among those kidnapped.  (I'm still not sure how Apache Chief and Scarecrow got paired up.  Maybe it's because they both wear brown?) \n"}, {"text": "In \"Fairy Tale of Doom,\" one of Toyman's inventions allows the Legion of Doom to trap certain Super Friends in storybooks.  Which Super Friend finds himself playing the title role in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\"?", "correct": "Hawkman", "options": ["Flash", "Green Lantern", "Aquaman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkman.\n\n\tHawkman follows Toyman into the storybook, and even climbs after Toyman as the latter scales the giant beanstalk to the giant's lair.  (That's right: CLIMBS.  Did Hawkman forget that he can fly?  That is, like, his only actual power, right?  Weird.) \n"}, {"text": "Three members of the Legion of Doom turn against the rest of the team in \"Doomsday.\"  Which villain is NOT one of these turncoats?", "correct": "Braniac", "options": ["Sinestro", "Black Manta", "Cheetah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBraniac.\n\n\tBlack Manta, Cheetah, and Sinestro take revenge against the rest of the Legion after being betrayed. \n"}, {"text": "\"Super Friends: Rest in Peace\" opens with an unusual scene in a 1978 kiddie cartoon -- a funeral.  Who's dead?", "correct": "Batman", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBatman.\n\n\tDon't worry -- he's not really dead.  Several of the Super Friends are seemingly killed by the Legion in this episode, but it turns out that the villains only \"killed\" the heroes' \"robot clones.\" \n"}, {"text": "In \"History of Doom,\" we get to see some more origin stories -- flashbacks explaining how the characters came to be who they are.  Which character's \"secret origin\" is NOT featured in this episode?", "correct": "Flash", "options": ["Giganta", "Lex Luthor", "Apache Chief"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlash.\n\n\tInterestingly, the origin of Giganta shown is completely different than the one depicted in the comics.  Back in the 1940's, Giganta was a character who had been evolved from a gorilla, and she primarily fought Wonder Woman.  In this episode, we learn that Giganta was just an ordinary woman who happened to witness Apache Chief's first moment as a hero, and got her hands on the \"magic powder\" that allowed him to grow to giant size.\r We do see a teenage Luthor lose his hair and declare war on Superboy, but Flash's origin does not appear in this episode. \n"}, {"text": "Even though this show focused primarily on the Super Friends as a whole, several supporting characters from the casts of \"Superman\" and \"Batman\" comic books appeared in this season.

Which character was NOT created specifically for \"Challenge of the Super Friends\"?", "correct": "Solomon Grundy", "options": ["Black Vulcan", "Apache Chief", "Samurai"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolomon Grundy.\n\n\tApache Chief and Samurai were invented by the folks at Hanna-Barbera to add a little cultural diversity to the team; they had no previous analogues in DC Comics.  Black Vulcan, similarly, was a new character, even though he was clearly based on a well-established character named Black Lightning.  (Anyone know why Hanna-Barbera didn't just use Black Lightning?  Was there some kind of rights dispute?  I've heard several rumors...)\r Solomon Grundy had been a villain in various DC comic books (most notably GREEN LANTERN and JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA) for decades before \"Challenge of the Super Friends\" came to be. \n"}]}
