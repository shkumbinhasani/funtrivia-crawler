The Detroit Tigers won the American League in 1934 with the Yankees finishing second.  Had the Yankees won, then maybe Gomez's outstanding 25-9 season might not have gone unnoticed.  In one of the closest point ballots in history, Cochrane had 67 points, Gehringer 65, Gomez 60, and fourth place finisher Schoolboy Rowe had 59.  Although Lefty won two Triple Crowns in his career, 1934 would be the closest that he came to immortalization. \n"}, {"text": "Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski never won a MVP award.  He had two outstanding seasons in his career, but the Cincinnati Reds foiled him both times.  In 1975, Reds second baseman Joe Morgan watched Greg be the runner-up, then a Reds outfielder beat him again.  Who made Luzinski a runner-up in 1977?", "correct": "George Foster", "options": ["Dave Cash", "Gary Carter", "Andre Dawson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Foster.\n\n\tThe others never played for the Reds.

Even in 1969 when he hit 44 home runs and batted .300, it was still not good enough for even a number two spot.
