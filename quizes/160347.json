{"id": "160347", "name": "'Monty Python's Flying Circus' - Episode 2 Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Monty Python"], "questions": [{"text": "In this episode, once again animals are victimized.  What typically land-based mammals apparently attempt to take flight in 'Sex and Violence'?", "correct": "Sheep", "options": ["Rhinos", "Horses", "Elephants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSheep.\n\n\tIn the opening sketch, two gentlemen discuss the odd phenomenon of sheep 'nesting' in some trees.  One gentleman describes the attempted flights as something more like 'plummeting'.  The sheep have been tricked into believing they can fly by a black sheep (in the figurative, not literal sense) named Harold, the 'clever sheep'. \n"}, {"text": "'And now for something completely different' was a common phrase heard throughout the 'Flying Circus' series.  It was first heard in this episode, and uttered by which Python?", "correct": "Eric Idle", "options": ["Terry Jones", "Terry Gilliam", "John Cleese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric Idle.\n\n\tThough John Cleese was most well-known for uttering the phrase, in 'Sex and Violence' it is Idle and Michael Palin who employ the idiom.  The phrase was apparently taken from news programs on the BBC. \n"}, {"text": "Following an interesting discussion among a group of British housewives about great French thinkers, we are introduced to a certain gentleman, named Arthur Frampton, who happens to have three of which body part?", "correct": "Buttocks", "options": ["Shoulders", "Fingers", "Knees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButtocks.\n\n\tMr. Frampton is gently requested to show us his third buttock, or 'bum', but refuses.  The 'three buttock' scene was abortively repeated.  In the middle of the second take, the interviewer, played by Cleese, suddenly feels a sense of deja vu.  Following the man with three buttocks scene, we also are treated to a man with two noses.  The housewives discuss Pascal, Voltaire, Sartre and Descartes.  It seems that throughout the series, British housewives have a thing for French intellectuals. \n"}, {"text": "Armed with giant wooden mallets, a gentleman named Arthur Ewing plays a cruel number with some mice.  What song does he play using his mallets and the unsuspecting mice?", "correct": "The Bells of St. Mary", "options": ["God Save the Queen", "The Navy Hymn", "Greensleeves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bells of St. Mary\n\n\tIn a moment of true animal cruelty (animal rights groups would have protested vehemently), Terry Jones wields mallets and pretends to strike mice, making them squeak out the tune.  There is no disclaimer at the end of the show, reassuring us that the mice used were unharmed. \n"}, {"text": "In the next sketch we find a sad, little fellow, played by Michael Palin, at a marriage counsellor with his wife Deirdre, attempting to resolve some problems between the two of them.  Instead, the counsellor seduces his wife, sending the poor chap out the door.  What is this fellow's name?", "correct": "Arthur Pewtey", "options": ["Arthur Aldridge", "Arthur Jackson", "Arthur Wearing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArthur Pewtey.\n\n\tFor some strange reason, the name Arthur is used over and over again in this episode.  All of the Arthur choices given were characters in 'Sex and Violence', but only Arthur Pewtey has his wife stolen by his marriage counsellor.  In the end, Pewtey is the victim of the man in armor and his chicken...so much for pathos! \n"}, {"text": "Next, in a purportedly early film, we are treated to the wacky antics of Queen Victoria and which 19th century British prime minister?", "correct": "Gladstone", "options": ["Palmerston", "Peel", "Disraeli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGladstone.\n\n\tPoor Gladstone, he is abused roundly by Victoria, and it's all caught on film.  Alfred Lord Tennyson is the narrator of said film.  Have the Pythons no decency? \n"}, {"text": "In the following sketch, we find a depressed father and his son arguing.  It seems that the son, who has chosen to be a coal miner, is embarrassed by his father's vocation.  What sort of thing does his father do?", "correct": "Playwright", "options": ["Doctor", "General", "Lawyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlaywright.\n\n\tIn a role reversal, the wealthy, upper-class father laments the fact that his coal-mining son looks down on his chosen vocation as a writer.  The father describes his difficulties, gala dinners, rubbing elbows with the rich and famous and the like.  He also struggles with his bout with writer's cramp... \n"}, {"text": "On the television show 'The Epilogue', a serious discussion about religion and philosophy is avoided in favor of a wrestling match between a Catholic monsignor, Edward Gay, and a philosophical writer called Dr. Tom Jack.  What is the title of Tom Jack's book?", "correct": "Hello, Sailor", "options": ["The Existentialism of Sartre", "Nietzsche's Superman", "From Plato to Kant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHello, Sailor.\n\n\tThe provocative title of Jack's book makes one curious indeed!  We learn nothing about his philosophy, however, but rather discover that he is a marvelous wrestler.  He cruelly body slams the monsignor several times before the end of the sketch. \n"}, {"text": "In a series of Terry Gilliam animations, we discover Rodin's famous sculture, called 'The Kiss', turned into a musical instrument.  What sort of instrument does 'The Kiss' sound like?", "correct": "Ocarina", "options": ["Tuba", "Clarinet", "Xylophone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOcarina.\n\n\tOn the leg of the woman in the sculpture are several holes, which the man's hand steadily 'plays' while apparently blowing through her mouth.  Incidentally, the name 'ocarina' comes from the Italian for 'goose'. \n"}, {"text": "The final sketch in this episode is a show entitled 'The World Around Us'.  The 'mouse problem' is discussed in this episode.  At one point, a psychiatrist called the Amazing Kargal is consulted to describe the problem.  He claims that what 'percentage of the population will always be mice'?", "correct": "8%", "options": ["20%", "77%", "2%"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8%.\n\n\t8% is awfully low, however.  I'd guess that it's actually higher.  Of course, Kargal also believes that all crimes should be legalized, including arson and murder, so who can trust him?  Thank you for trying this quiz, or not trying it, depending on the way you think about it. \n"}]}
