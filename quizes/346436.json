Mercedes says she wants to be the spectacle that is Michael, especially since the girls missed out on their opportunity to perform one of the greatest pop figures' numbers on their own.  When Will suggests that, perhaps, they should all get a Jackson number ready for Regionals, Blaine recommends \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", a number the kids take to the auditorium stage to perform. \n"}, {"text": "Who accidentally reveals the plans to perform Michael Jackson to the Warblers?", "correct": "Blaine", "options": ["Kurt", "Will", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlaine.\n\n\tFinn approaches Rachel for an answer to his engagement proposal (made exactly three days earlier) but she's hesitant to give an answer since it all seems so fast and so early.  She assures him that he's the only guy for her, but he says that if they're going to be together regardless there shouldn't be any problems.  Finn finally concedes and lets her take more time to think about her response.\rAt the Lima Bean, some of the New Directions discuss the works of Michael Jackson and, surprisingly, Rachel says she never really connected with him as an artist.  When Sebastian, the head member of the Dalton Academy Warblers, stops by for a quick chat, he says that his club drew the first slot at Regionals and that they'll be performing Michael Jackson because Blaine accidentally let it slip over the phone that New Directions was doing the same. \n"}, {"text": "When Will announces the lesson of the week, what does he write on the board?", "correct": "WWMJD", "options": ["\"Bad\"", "\"Beat It\"", "King of Pop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWWMJD.\n\n\tIn the choir room, the club wonders about Blaine's loyalty to the New Directions considering he let their new Regional plans slip, but Finn backs him up saying that there's nothing to be done about it anymore.

Finn suggests that they fight back and Blaine says that Michael would take it to the streets...so they do.\rThe members of New Directions meet the Warblers in a parking garage wearing leather jackets and they decide the only way to settle things is a Jackson-off. \n"}, {"text": "After the Jackson-off against the Warblers, Blaine is injured by which of the following?", "correct": "A tampered slushie", "options": ["A nasty fall", "A kick to the leg", "A car accident"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tampered slushie.\n\n\tThe Warblers and the New Directions immediately break into song-- Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" is the choice with Artie, Santana, and Blaine on lead vocals.  At the end of the song, Sebastian reveals a red slushie and hits Blaine in the face with it, sending him to the ground.\rThe next day, Kurt reveals that the slushie caused a deep injury to his cornea and that he'll need surgery to fix it.  The kids believe that the slushie was tampered with and while Will says it may be true, they can't know anything until an investigation is held by the school board.  The kids want to fight back again, but Will says he won't allow violence.  Artie in particular has an issue with this and Will asks him to take a break.

She says that if it were her, she wouldn't necessarily break up but she wouldn't want to bring an anchor from her past into her bright future and she thinks that Rachel will have everything she's wanted.  She elaborates that they're a great couple, but they may need to call it quits.\rQuinn takes to the stage to sing The Jackson 5's \"Never Can Say Goodbye\".

Santana says that she's willing to get back at him despite Kurt's decision to take the high road.\rMercedes is called to the auditorium by Sam who, with his guitar, puts her name up in lights on the stage.

Santana says it isn't okay since Blaine needs surgery but Sebastian clarifies-- it's okay because the one he throws at her is just a regular slushie.\rBack at McKinley, Santana says that she did it.  Using Artie's tape recorder, she was able to record Sebastian admitting what he did.  Kurt doesn't like the idea of using it to get Sebastian expelled because the Warblers would still perform Michael Jackson and because it wouldn't get them anywhere.
