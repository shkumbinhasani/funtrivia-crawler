'Twelve and a bit', however, is something I made up, but could be 12.01, 12 1/2, 12.3 etc. \n"}, {"text": "The phrase 'baker's dozen' is widely used. Which of the following card games has a variant of that name?", "correct": "Solitaire", "options": ["Whist", "Blackjack", "Hearts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSolitaire.\n\n\tThe game of solitaire generally involves trying to sort the pack of 52 cards into their suits (in order). This variant of solitaire is so-called because you start with 13 columns (a baker's dozen) as opposed to the more popular versions that you see on your computer that normally have seven columns. \n"}, {"text": "The practice of making a baker's dozen as opposed to a normal dozen was always commonplace across many food retailers (butchers, greengrocers, etc.); it just happened to be called a 'baker's dozen' without a real correlation to bakers.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThere are several potential reasons why it was originally bakers who operated the system of making one more than the desired dozen.  The first was the Assize of Bread and Ale statute that was introduced under Henry III of England, which suggested that bakers who shortchanged their clients would be subject to severe punishment (losing hands and the like). So to be sure to avoid punishment, they would bake more than the required amount to make sure customers were always satisfied.\r Another potential explanation is that 13 circular objects, such as rolls or biscuits fit well into a rectangular baking tray, more so than 12.\r It seems that for bakers to provide 13, as opposed to the desired 12, was widespread across Europe, but not amongst all food sellers. \n"}, {"text": "In geography, what is the 13th largest US state by total area?", "correct": "Utah", "options": ["California", "Rhode Island", "Alaska"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUtah.\n\n\tUtah has a total area (land and water) of around 85,000 square miles, and so ranks thirteenth in the list of largest states. Alaska is the largest state in the US and takes up around 21% of the total land area. California is also a vast state, the third largest with an area of around 164,000 square miles. In comparison, Rhode Island is the smallest of the 50 states of the US, with an area of around 1500 square miles.\r For those who are interested, the state with the 13th largest land area is Kansas (Utah is 12th), and the 13th highest by water area is Hawaii (Utah is 16th). \n"}, {"text": "In computing, how would you go about representing a baker's dozen in binary form?", "correct": "1101", "options": ["1111", "1001", "1011"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1101.\n\n\tThe binary system operates in base two. This means that the unit digit (the rightmost digit) can either represent 2^0 or 0, the next digit on the left represents either 2^1 or 0 and so on. So 1101 means 2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0, which in decimal is 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.  The number 1111 represents fifteen, 1001 is nine and 1011 means eleven. \n"}, {"text": "Now for some history: which of these events occurred in the 13th Century AD?", "correct": "England's King John signed the Magna Carta", "options": ["Man first landed on the moon", "Creation of the earth", "The Battle of Hastings occurred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEngland's King John signed the Magna Carta.\n\n\tThe 13th Century is defined as the 100 years from 1201 AD to 1300 AD inclusive. King John of England signed the \"Magna Carta\" in 1215 AD. It was forced upon him by the feudal barons, and it declared that he did not have arbitrary power in the country. This meant that someone could only be punished for breaking the laws of the country.\r As we all know (hopefully), Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins landed on the moon in Apollo 11 in 1969, over 600 years after the end of the 13th Century. The Battle of Hastings was in 1066, almost 150 years before the start of the 13th Century and the earth was created about 4.6 billion years ago. \n"}, {"text": "Thirteen is the lowest number that has eight letters when written out.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tOne - three letters\rTwo - three letters\rThree  - five letters\rFour - four letters\rFive - four letters\rSix - three letters\rSeven - five letters\rEight - five letters\rNine - four letters\rTen - three letters\rEleven - six letters\rTwelve - six letters\rThirteen - eight letters\r So thirteen is the first number to consist of eight letters when written out. Fourteen was a close second. \n"}, {"text": "In Judaism the coming of age ceremony for a young girl takes place at the age of 12. What is the name given to the male equivalent, typically occurring at the age of 13?", "correct": "Bar Mitzvah", "options": ["Jugendweihe", "Confirmation", "Russefeiring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBar Mitzvah.\n\n\tBar/Bat Mitzvah means son/daughter of the commandment and represents the time in a Jewish child's life when they are seen to be responsible for their own actions and adherence to Jewish law. Although the phrase refers to the people themselves, it is often taken to mean the ceremony in the English language.\r The other 3 answers refer to other coming of age ceremonies. 'Confirmation' is a rite of passage in many Christian denominations representing the confirmation of the covenant made at Baptism. Jugendweihe is a secular German alternative to confirmation that was particularly prevalent in East Germany. Finally the russefeiring is a Norwegian celebration for those in the final year of high school. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is not a baker's dozen?", "correct": "The age at which someone can purchase alcohol in the UK", "options": ["The date on which some Fridays are unlucky", "The number of original colonies of the United States", "The feared number of those with triskaidekaphobia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe age at which someone can purchase alcohol in the UK.\n\n\tAs much as many thirteen-year-olds would like to be able to go out at that age, the actual legal drinking age in the UK is 18 years of age.\r Many people believe the number thirteen, and as a result Friday the 13th, is unlucky. In the Gregorian calendar, used in most countries worldwide, this will occur at least once a year and at most three times (a bad year for those afraid of the day!).\r The thirteen colonies were formed by England over a period of more than 150 years.  In 1776, they joined together to form the United States of America. The original colonies are represented by the 13 stripes in the flag of the US. \n"}, {"text": "And finally a bit of arithmetic, how many would you have if you had a baker's dozen of baker's dozens?", "correct": "169 & one hundred sixty nine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\n169 & one hundred sixty nine.\n\n\tAs you've probably worked out by now there are 13 in a baker's dozen. And 13 x 13 = 169. \n"}]}
