{"id": "278596", "name": "A Tour of Trivial Manor Trivia Quiz | Thematic Fun | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun", "Thematic Story Time"], "questions": [{"text": "Beginning the tour, we shall make our way to the foyer where you may notice the grand chandelier.  Years of preservation have made this one of our more beautiful rooms.  In fact, many movies have been filmed in this location.\n\nSpeaking of building preservation, which of these is not on the United States' National Register of Historic Places?", "correct": "The Birthplace of George Washington in Westmoreland County, Virginia", "options": ["The Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Robie House in Chicago, Illinois", "The Kennedy Compound in Hyannisport, Massachusetts", "New York Stock Exchange in New York City, New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Birthplace of George Washington in Westmoreland County, Virginia.\n\n\tThe National Register of Historic Places is a list of buildings, sites, and locations which are preserved through government funding due to their backgrounds and histories.  Originally part of the National Historic Preservation Act, which also lists National Historic Landmarks (also protected by the same concept), the NRHP is very extensive due to its age.  Certain locations may or may not receive a grant depending on the physical state and needs for maintenance and upkeep.\rAny building added to the list must fall under a specific category and must not fall under the list of excluding criteria.  Specifically, the Birthplace of George Washington in Virginia can not be listed for preservation under this act because it is a birthplace.  According to the NRHP, birthplaces, gravesites of famous people, or structures which have been moved from their original site (to name a few) are reasons for exclusion.\rThe Robie House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was placed onto the first listing of the NRHP in 1966.  The Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod was added in 1972 and also became a National Historic Landmark on the same day, and the New York Stock Exchange was inducted in 1978. \n"}, {"text": "If you come to this room on the left, our parlor's furniture was designed in the English Baroque era, and you can tell from the wood finish around the walls that our designers tried to work the grain of the furniture in with the decor.\n\nIf the British monarch's furniture changes based on the time period, in whose parlor are you likely to find similar Baroque furniture/architecture?", "correct": "Queen Anne", "options": ["King George II", "Queen Victoria", "Queen Elizabeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQueen Anne.\n\n\tThe English side of Baroque Architecture began after the Great Fire of London in 1666 and ended in 1713, at which point Neoclassical architecture began making its debut in Europe.  Queen Anne is the only one of the four monarchs listed to have reigned during the Baroque era, spanning these five decades.  Notably, during Queen Anne's reign, the Acts of Union was passed in 1707 turning England and Scotland into the United Kingdom.\rKing George II reigned about half a century after Queen Anne during a Neoclassical architecture period.  Queen Elizabeth would have taken her reign in a mid-to-late Renaissance-clad parlor during the late 16th century while Queen Victoria would have reigned during the Gothic Revival period in the Victorian era.\rAlthough Baroque architecture had more prominence in Italy, an example of such styles in England is St. Paul's Cathedral in London.  Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles in France and St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City would also be clear examples. \n"}, {"text": "If you take a right at this next hallway we'll come to the kitchen.  If you look against the wall you'll see a Clome resting against the tiles.  While this hasn't been used in decades, it's still a prominent feature here.\n\nA Clome Oven's chimney is usually made with brick as opposed to clay.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tClome Chimneys are not built with any chimney at all.  This type of oven will be separated from walls altogether when used.  Essentially, a Clome Oven will be filled with embers and food can be baked within its large, clay basin.  Because these types of ovens are typically wood-burning, they'll produce soot and ash.\rBecause the Clome is made of clay, it can withstand astoundingly high temperatures before cracking.  As well, temperature could be affected moreso by the position of the door (ajar or closed), so a bit of panache would be needed to cook without burning.\rBecause Clomes do not make use of chimneys, placement in the kitchen is an important thing to think about.  Clomes should be placed in an area of exceptional ventilation like near a window or existing chimney.\rIn modern days, a Clome Oven most resembles ovens used in a pizzeria. \n"}, {"text": "If we backtrack and head upstairs we'll visit our lavish Grand Hall.  This hallway is certainly trivial indeed what with its burgundy carpets and ornamental tapestries.  Please follow along closely.\n\nWhich of these halls is not a location which can be visited?", "correct": "Monty Hall", "options": ["Royal Albert Hall", "Massey Hall", "Carnegie Hall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonty Hall.\n\n\tCarnegie Hall is one of the more popular halls out there.  Found in Manhattan, New York City, New York, Carnegie Hall is a major location for concerts and orchestral performances.  Originally a home for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Carnegie Hall features many instances of Baroque architecture.  The building itself finished construction and opened to the awaiting public in 1890.  Coincidentally, Carnegie Hall was added to the NRHP in 1966.\rRoyal Albert Hall is in London, England.  Holding promenade concerts hosted by the BBC, the Royal Albert was opened in 1871 by none other than Queen Victoria.  Royal Albert Hall is known for being the only location where The Beatles and The Rolling Stones performed a show together...and it happened only once.\rMassey Hall has had performances since its opening in 1894.  Found in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, this concert hall has held its fair share of performances from Canadian and international artists alike.  It is now held as Heritage Property in the City of Toronto.\rMonty Hall was the host of the long-running TV game show \"Let's Make a Deal\".  He retired from the job in the eighties. \n"}, {"text": "Continue on over this way if you will and come with me to the library.  Many of our books are first edition, and visitors can read them in the overlooking lounge.\n\nIn which of our many books are you likely to read of the properties of Longbourn and Rosings?", "correct": "\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen", "options": ["\"Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie", "\"Peter Pan\" by J. M. Barrie", "\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" by C. S. Lewis"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen.\n\n\tAlthough these two residences are not real, both are prominent in the fictional version of Britain in Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\".  Written in 1813, \"Pride and Prejudice\" was one of the most popular books of this time, and to this day it remains a best-seller.  The film was later released as a BBC mini-series in 1995 and as a film starring Keira Knightley in 2005 (for which she received an Oscar nomination).\rIn the novel, Longbourn is the residence of the protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, and her family in Hertfordshire while Rosings is the beautiful property of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Kent.  The contrast of both of these locations shows in the second volume of the book at a point where Elizabeth discovers the truth about the seemingly-antagonistic Mr. Darcy.  While Hertfordshire and Kent exist in Britain, both bordering London, these two locations, and many others within the book, are not. \n"}, {"text": "And now we have come to the first of many bedrooms in this manor.  Surely, one may wonder how we came across such lavish furnishings, but I remind you, we have taken the utmost care in preparing this manor.  For example, each of the bedposts of our four-poster bed mimic the column upon which Horatio Nelson stands.\n\nWhere can one find the original version of this column?", "correct": "Trafalgar Square", "options": ["Brandenburg Gate", "Washington Monument", "Canada's House of Commons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrafalgar Square.\n\n\tThough William Railton didn't find immense fame from numerous works of architecture, his most famous work, Nelson's Column, can be found in Trafalgar Square in London, England.  This piece stands 151 feet tall and was erected in 1843.  Forty years before it was built, Admiral Horatio Nelson was a leader in the Battle of Trafalgar, at which he fell.  The column itself is dubbed as Corinthian due to the fact that it is comprised of a long, narrow piece topped with an elaborate capital.  This style of architecture has both Roman and Greek roots and can be seen in both European and Middle-Eastern architecture.\rWashington Monument is found in Washington DC.  Completed in 1884, this obelisk is one of the most well-known landmarks in the U.S. capital city.  Until the Eiffel Tower was erected five years later, it was the tallest free-standing structure in the world.\rWhile Canada's House of Commons is found on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Brandenburg Gate is found in Berlin, Germany.  Of all of the buildings listed, Brandenburg Gate is the oldest. \n"}, {"text": "Our bathrooms are, in themselves, masterpieces.  As you step into this lavatory filled to the brim with Roman architecture reminiscent of the baths of years past, you'll notice that years of handiwork are exemplified here.\n\nWhich of these installations in our Roman-themed bathroom would be most out of place?", "correct": "A scale model of the Parthenon", "options": ["A recreation of the Discobolus", "A bust of Julius Caesar", "A mural of an aqueduct along the wall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA scale model of the Parthenon.\n\n\tFound in the Bath region of the United Kingdom, the Roman Baths are a very interesting building to find.  Having been discovered by the Romans as a geological 'hot spot' in approximately 850 BC, these Baths have become a historically-important locale.  Since then, a Bathhouse has been built to contain these waters, and it has become a popular tourist attraction.\rThe bust of Julius Caesar is aptly located within this room because of its historical significance.  Caesar, having taken over the Roman Empire and reigning for half a decade was more influential than most for the empire's lifespan.\rThe Discobolus, a Roman recreation of an earlier Greek statue, is now housed in the National Museum of Rome having been discovered on a Roman property many centuries ago.\rRome itself contains numerous aqueducts within its city limits, all of which were used in earlier eras.  Over time, the Roman Empire expanded and aqueducts stretched across many different regions of Europe.  The oldest Roman aqueduct, Aqua Appia, was built in 4th century BC while the newest is as recent as the 1940s.\rThe Parthenon is the only out-of-place piece in the bathroom due to the fact that it's not in Rome at all; it's found in Athens.  This example of Classical architecture is Greek in nature- not Roman. \n"}, {"text": "If you may come back down the stairs, we shall now move onto the sun-room.  We take great care with our plants and ensure that this room is green and eco-friendly.  Please make sure not to touch the plants; some of these are dangerous.\n\nWhich natural substance, notorious for the chemical dangers it poses, was once used in building and construction?", "correct": "Asbestos", "options": ["Basalt", "Bamboo", "Jute"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsbestos.\n\n\tRest assured that we do not keep the naturally-produced mineral, asbestos, within the property.  Due to the fact that asbestos can resist heat and electricity, it makes perfect sense to use the mineral as insulation for housing.  Of course, this would be ideal if the material weren't toxic.  Due to the fact that asbestos can cause many diseases (including cancer), it has been banned from use in many countries.  In the United States, the EPA has placed a very strict ban on asbestos in certain products, even controlling the amount of fibers found in a drop of water.\rNonetheless, asbestos is still used in construction in developing countries due to the fact that it is inexpensive and put to the seemingly-proper use.  Abundancy of the product in South America and Asia has made the use of asbestos-related building products continue.\rStill, asbestos is regarded as hazardous material and should be treated as such. \n"}, {"text": "If you'll continue with me onwards to the final room of our tour, we shall investigate the games room.  Although there are many games in this room from centuries of gaming's past, some of our favourite recent additions have been welcomed with open arms.\n\nWhich of these toys or games does not involve building?", "correct": "Perfection", "options": ["Jenga", "Mousetrap", "Lincoln Logs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerfection.\n\n\tBuilding games are often a matter of physical and mental prowess combined.  With \"Jenga\", players take fifty-four wooden blocks, stack them in flat panels of three each, and take turns pulling single units out and placing them on top of the pile, making the structure ever-taller.  In doing this, the tower is made much more unstable and the game gets more difficult with every piece.\r\"Mousetrap\", while usually regarded as a traditional board game, also has a large building element to it.  Every time a player lands on a build space, another piece of an elaborate mousetrap is built onto the board.  This culminates to a final cage drop and a winner of the game.\rLincoln Logs are specially-made wooden logs that can be stacked one upon the other to build structures.  Coincidentally, they were invented by famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright's son.\r\"Perfection\", while being a game by Milton Bradley, is not building based.  Instead, the game occurs on a timed platform in which you must place a number of shaped, plastic widgets into the gameboard before the time runs out and pops up, ruining everything you've worked hard to achieve.  The winner is the one to place all forty-something pieces into the correct slots. \n"}, {"text": "Now that we've returned to the main foyer of Trivial Manor, I'd like to thank you for joining us on the tour.  If you look to the ceiling, you may see some of our intricate wall paintings and frescos.\n\nWhere else can you find a 'fresco'?", "correct": "The Sistine Chapel", "options": ["The White House", "Sleeping Beauty Castle in Walt Disney World", "Sydney Opera House"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sistine Chapel.\n\n\tA fresco is a painting or design depicted on a plaster wall or ceiling.  Most of these tend to be elaborate and intricate in design.  Perhaps the most well-known of these is the fresco completed by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.  Over three hundred different scenes from \"The Bible\" appear in the fresco found there.  The piece itself is considered to be one of Michelangelo's most prominent works due to its beauty and size.  Michaelangelo is also affiliated with the construction and design of St. Peter's Basilica, also in Vatican City.\r The White House is in Washington D.C.  The design and architecture of the 19th century fortress Neuschwanstein Castle, found in Bavaria, was the basis for the construction of Sleeping Beauty Castle in the Disney Magic Kingdom theme parks.  Sydney Opera House, meanwhile, is found in Sydney Harbour on Bennelong Point.\r This, my friends, concludes our wondrous, thought-provoking tour of Trivial Manor.  If you wish to ask any questions about what you have seen here today, you may inquire to myself or any of our other guides.
