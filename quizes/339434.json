{"id": "339434", "name": "\"Jersey Shore\" - Season 3 Quiz | Jersey Shore | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Jersey Shore"], "questions": [{"text": "Did Angelina return for the third season of \"Jersey Shore\"?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAfter a season of Angelina, Florida beaches, and an incriminating note, the housemates from \"Jersey Shore\" (sans Angelina) made their return to the shorehouse for another summer of fun.  While everyone started to drive to the shore, Snooki went and picked up the replacement roommate, Deena (who, apparently, likes to party).  JWoww was eager to leave her boyfriend, just to get some space, and Ron and Sam drove down together to celebrate their first year together.  Ron and Sam were the first to arrive and they ended up claiming two beds in a room of three, much to the final arrival's (The Situation's) disappointment.  Of course, everyone settled in with drinks.  Deena tried to make a good impression on Sammi from the get-go, but a couple of bad impressions put them at odds.  Sam and Ron decided to spend most of their first night in their room while the others enjoyed themselves (though Snooki was a bit frustrated with Vinny for sleeping with Ryder a few weeks earlier).  Deena also made an impression on Mike by 'accidentally' taking off her clothes.  When Deena went upstairs, a fight was sparked between Sam and Ron and the girls (and some of Jenni's hair got pulled out).\r The next morning, Sitch woke everyone up and the guys (with Sam) headed to the gym while the girls went for a tan.  This inevitably led up to the first night at the club.  While everyone started to drink and find partners to come home with, Jenni forgot her and Tom's anniversary and Mike lost a girl to Vinny.  The next day, much to everyone's disappointment, Sam and Ron also skipped out on Sunday dinner.  Everyone had their first day stopping in at the t-shirt shop (and Mike had his first day skipping out on work) while the meatballs and Vinny developed an elaborate scheme to fetch a lost beach ball.  Everyone headed out to the boardwalk as a group (including Sam and Ron) though Sammi wasn't afraid to express her distaste.  It was becoming \"Miami\" all over again. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Snooki arrested for 'being a nuisance'?", "correct": "The beach", "options": ["The Shore Store", "Karma", "The shorehouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe beach.\n\n\tJenni and Vinny realized that Snooki hadn't stopped drinking since she got to the shore.  At one point she ate a raw potato.  While she tried to sleep with Vinny (unsuccessfully) Deena tried to spend a night with Mike (also unsuccessfully).  Before work the next day, Ron and Sam argued over a non-existent issue, mostly stemming from Sam's (reasonable) lack of trust.  This led Sam to apologize to Snooki in the back room; she admitted that she was wrong for cutting off the friendship and that Snooki was right.  Snooki said that she could come to her for her problems.  Before they headed out to the club, Sam apologized to Deena as well saying that they got off on the wrong foot.  Later, Jenni said that she and Sam would never be friends.\r At the club, Deena got kicked out (she drank too much before they arrived), Snooki started falling over, and Jenni spent time with a new guy, Roger (until she was told he already had a girlfriend).  Pauly's stalker, Danielle, also made her reappearance...only to throw a drink in his face.\r The next day, Snooki was opposed to doing pretty much anything.  She decided to go to work in what she wore the night before; she tried to funnel beer on the job; she left for coffee and was found buying pickles.  In the meantime, Deena and Jenni headed to the Boardwalk where they found her at the bar.  When she evidently blacked out, she decided to search for the beach, much to Jenni and Deena's frustration, and made too much of a nuisance of herself.  She was taken to the station by the cops and they were left waiting for a call. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the boyfriend who Jenni broke up with during this season?", "correct": "Tom", "options": ["Roger", "Dean", "Nick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTom.\n\n\tWhile the girls waited, Jenni called Tom and got yelled at for not calling sooner.  During their on-phone battle, Jenni took a call telling her that she could pick up Snooki, so everyone ventured out to get her (surprisingly, Jenni had a 'Free Snooki' shirt made in that time).  That night during 'girl talk', Snooki blamed her angry drunk disposition on what happened between her and Emilio in Miami.  Jenni blamed it on the fact that Snooki searches for love wherever she can.\r At the club, Deena made herself a valuable asset to M.V.P. at Bamboo and everybody had a good time.  When Deena started spending time with a Ronnie lookalike, the guys brought him home for a laugh.  It turned out that not only did Ronnie know the guy, but he had a girlfriend named Sam.  Snooki decided that she would never drink again.  Of course, this wouldn't last time.  The next day, Jenni discovered that Roger did not, in fact, actually have a girlfriend.  Despite the fact that she and Tom were still together, she decided to take it easy with the new guy.  A day on the boardwalk with Roger, Deena, and another guy only served to make her decision for her.\r After a night with Roger, Jenni decided to tell him about Roger and end it.  When she was told he was moving out, she decided to head back home to check in on her dogs and personal belongings.  Snooki went back with her.  To their shock, when they arrived, the dogs had not only been left alone, but Tom locked her out, stole some of her belongings, and took the bed. \n"}, {"text": "In episode five, \"Drunk Punch Love\", Snooki and Vinny buy which of these items for the house?", "correct": "Stripper pole", "options": ["DJ booth", "Fish tank", "Deep fryer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStripper pole.\n\n\tSnooki and Jenni returned to the shorehouse with Jenni's dogs in tow; they decided to fence them off in their room.  Before they get back, Snooki's friend Ryder showed up so Deena took her for drinks and to the boardwalk for the day.  Upon the girls' return to the house, everyone went to the club and Jenni met up with Roger again.  Vinny took a Sicilian girl but found that he family was too overprotective (when they stopped in to pick her up).  Ron and Sam fought; he threw all of her clothes out of the closet and told her to pack.  In the end it was Jenni who approached Ron about his problems with Sammi when she found out, she punched him in the face.  Everyone else decided to celebrate Ryder's birthday instead.\r By morning, all of Sam's things ended up at the door.  Despite her plans to leave, Sam vowed to make things better with Ron and everyone else and called off the plan.  Ryder left by morning and everyone had a meal together as a family.\r For date night, Jenni and Roger and Deena and Dean (the Ronnie lookalike) went out for dinner while Vinny and Snooki went out and bought a stripper pole for the house.  At the club the next night, Jenni made the first steps to repairing the relationship with Sammi and both considered the drama to have come to an end. \n"}, {"text": "What ultimately caused Sam to leave the shorehouse in \"Cabs are Here!\"?", "correct": "Ron destroyed her belongings", "options": ["Ron cheated on her at Karma", "Sam's parents came to pick her up", "Sam found someone's number in Ron's pocket"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon destroyed her belongings.\n\n\tComing back from the club, Ronnie got sick and Snooki passed out in the dog room.  While Ronnie went to the doctor for an impromptu examination (during which he was told he needed to curb his drinking), Snooki, Jenni, and Deena went to the phramacy (and Snooki broke a child's bike).  At the club, Deena started to enjoy the company of one of Ronnie's friends, Dario, and the two of them went back to the house together.  Snooki found her own guy too, but he revealed that he was once engaged and she decided to break it off with him.  While the guys GTLed the next day, the girls went to the sex shop.  When the girls got home, however, the guys were disappointed that they hadn't pulled their weight around the house.  This started another fight between Ron and Sam.\r The next night was quite eventful.  Pauly spoke with Danielle, the stalker, and brought her home from the club only to make fun of her.  Sam talked with Snooki at home about Ron and inevitably, Ron and Sam came to their breaking point.  They decided to fix up the room situation and they semi-officially broke up.\r The next day, Mike tried to talk to Sam about what happened in Miami and Ron overheard the conversation.  When Ron had a chance to speak with him (in front of everyone), Mike was the one to man up and apologize.  Ron put his foot down with Sam as well; when everyone got ready to go to the club, the two of them fought until Ron decided to toss her clothes out onto the balcony.  This escalated to Ron attempting to move her entire bed out of the room.  The guys had to split them up.\r Ron and the guys tried to cool off by going to the club and, after the girls moved all of Sammi's things to their room, they tried to do the same at Aztec.  Sammi spitefully decided to dance with other guys and this frustrated him so much that he decided to head home and smash everything she owns.  The next day, Sam told the girls that she would be leaving that night.  After packing her things, she called a cab, said her goodbyes, and left. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to Sam's belongings in \"The Great Depression\" after she left the shorehouse?", "correct": "The girls moved them to their room", "options": ["She came and picked them up", "They were burnt by Ron", "They were left in the rain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe girls moved them to their room.\n\n\tRonnie was shocked that Sammi even decided to leave.  Sammi headed back to her parents to talk about what happened and she spent some well-needed time away from the shorehouse.\r Ron realized that the girls of the house started to side with Sam (who, in all fairness, didn't even want to get involved anymore) and went to bed.  Snooki and Deena, meanwhile, decided to start a prank war with Pauly and Vinny by pushing cake into Vinny's face.  Vinny retaliated by putting a bag of dog poop under Deena's pillow who, in turn, placed it under his pillow (because she was hiding under her bed the whole time).  Vinny took Snooki's crocodile stuffed animal and hung it off the balcony by a rope as revenge.  Luckily for her, Mike blew the whistle.\r While Ron was out at work the next day, everyone at home decided that the girls should move all of Sammi's stuff out of her room.  The guys took him for haircuts while this happened.  When Ron got back and found out what happened, Jenni tried to talk to Sam on the phone.  At Karma, Snooki told Ron that he and Sam are better apart but he said that he'd win her back.\r Deena felt like the rest of the house was really mean with her because she's the new girl and she needed to get hazed.  On the way back from the club, she broke down (mostly due to the alcohol) because everyone was making her feel like a joke.  The guys tried to assure her that they've all been fooling around and it's Ron who calmed her down, saying that they're going to treat her like a baby sister no matter what.  Later that night, Deena admitted to Ron that the girls moved her stuff.  After a quick talk, Ron decided that he, like Sam, might need to leave the house. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Kissing Cousins\", Mike pranks Snooki and Deena by sending their taxi to which location?", "correct": "Times Square", "options": ["Chicago", "Myrtle Beach", "Toronto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimes Square.\n\n\tRon needed to speak to someone outside the house so he called up his dad who came down and talked him into staying.  He said that no matter where he could go, he would end up feeling the same way.  Meanwhile, Pauly, Mike, and Deena skipped out on an hour of work to buy a miniature motorbike from a sideshow on the boardwalk.  When they got home, the guys rode it around the roof.  Snooki tried to go on a date with Nick, Roger's friend, but discovered that he was friends with the guy she brought home the night before.  That night, Snooki thought Vinny was trying to reciprocate feelings for her, but she was disappointed that he wouldn't snuggle with her.\r Ron called Sam early the next morning but said that there was no way they could be friends after dating like they did.  Snooki and Deena spent a short amount of time sticking marshmallows all around the house, so Mike called a taxi for them.  They wanted to head to the boardwalk; instead they went to Times Square, much to their shock and disappointment.  The guys, meanwhile, planned to go to Rivoli's, a restaurant, but Mike lagged back and got left behind.  Because of everyone else's frustrations with him, he enjoyed dinner alone back at the house.  Sam, meanwhile, decided to pack up and head back to the Jersey Shore.\r When the guys got back, Mike acted standoffish.  The girls raved about the great time they had and expressed their disappointment with Mike.  Before everyone headed out to the club, Sammi walked in the front door. \n"}, {"text": "Snooki, Ron, and Sam pranked Mike by placing which of these between the covers of his bed?", "correct": "Cheese", "options": ["Pickles", "Whoopie cushions", "Beer cans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheese.\n\n\tUpon Sam's return to the house, everyone was excited so see her back.  Ron, on the other hand, was quite worried.  Although he tried to speak to her, she kept her distance and independence.  The guys told Ron to keep the fighting out of the picture.  That night, everyone went to the club, as usual.  Vinny brought back a girl and Snooki revealed her true feelings for him to Sam.  This turned out to be devastating to Nicole.  During bowling the next day, Sam told Vinny to do the right thing.\r A toilet fix, a frightening car ride with Deena, a cleaning session (in which Snooki cleaned an entire bathroom with a mop), and a prank on Mike (involving cheese in his bed) all happened in a short amount of time.  While Sam, Ron, and Snooki had a sober night (for the first time all summer), Jenni, Deena, and MVP headed to Aztec.  Nicole inevitably apologized to Vinny about her behavior and the two of them both said that they wouldn't let anything ruin their friendship. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Gym, Tan, Find Out Who Sammi is Texting\", the eleventh episode of the season, who was Sammi supposedly texting?", "correct": "Arvin", "options": ["Danny", "Ron", "Roger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArvin.\n\n\tVinny and Pauly headed to Staten Island to visit Vin's family for dinner.  The extended family, of course, had a feast set up for them.  Meanwhile, the girls and Ron headed to the gym and salon for the day leaving Mike at home, disappointed that he was left behind by everyone.  To get back at them, he let Jenni's dogs run free through the house.\r Jenni dealt with Roger 'doing the dip' while the gang was out tanning and she needlessly called off their relationship until he called and they made amends (with Jenni admitting her wrongs).  Vinny finally got a tan to fit in with everyone else and soon the guys and girls had a water balloon fight.\r Ron approached Sam to work things out and get back together.  When she said yes, the girls disagreed with her decision.  When they ended up going to the club, however, Mike discovered that a friend of his, Arvin, had intended to meet Sammi there on her text invitation.  This led to a falling out between her and Ron, who sided with his boy.  And, of course, there was arguing. \n"}, {"text": "In their last days at the shorehouse, whose mother drunk-called?", "correct": "Ron's", "options": ["Mike's", "Snooki's", "Sam's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon's.\n\n\tSam and Ron's arguing spanned more than one episode.  Now, Ron was the slighted one; Sam admitted that she was in the wrong.  Deena had her last day at the Shore Store and Danny awarded her with the title of 'worst employee of 2010'.  Vinny took Snooki out for burgers, just the two of them.  He admitted (off-camera) that he could be serious with Snooki and he values their relationship.  Vinny also got his ear pierced and this slight alteration made a noticeable change in his attitude.  After Vinny and Pauly brought some girls home from the club, they were asked to leave and Vinny joked that Snooki would be his back-up, much to her anger.  On Mike's last day at work, he fell asleep behind a pile of boxes and Danny fired him.\r To add more fuel to the fire, Ron's drunk mother called the house and after Deena handed off the phone to Jenni...and she handed it off to Mike, she found out everything that Sam did at the shore since she got back.  After a rather large argument, Mike called Arvin on Ron's behalf to find out the other side of the story.  This was when Ron found out that Sam and Arvin had a more interesting past than envisioned.\r Danny, the Shore Store boss and landlord, held a party for all of the workers and many friendly faces from the show made their appearance (including Uncle Nino and Roger).  All went well excluding Deena's stopping Vinny from sleeping with her friend.  This later escalated when Vinny referred to Deena as 'Angelina'.  Jenni's dad met Roger while Pauly D DJ'ed and Sam and Ron continued to argue.\r Mike tried to apologize the next day for his actions towards Sam and everyone headed to Rivoli's for a final dinner.  Deena made a toast to a everyone for a great summer before they headed out to the club for a last night at Karma.  Roger asked Jenni to stay in an exclusive relationship with him and Ron and Sam argued even more.  The next day they decided it was best to stay single.\r Everyone spent the last day packing and getting ready for their last moments in the Jersey Shorehouse.  Slowly but surely, everyone got their things together and made the long drive home. \n"}]}
