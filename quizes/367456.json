Despite this, most of his popular commercial songs came from his third album, \"In Between Dreams\", which only hit number two on the same chart.  \"Better Together\", in particular, was a major hit for Johnson, as was \"Upside Down\", which he released on the soundtrack for the \"Curious George\" animated film.\r This title comes to us from Daaanieeel. \n"}, {"text": "Also the name of her sixth album, what Britney Spears song only reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100?", "correct": "Circus", "options": ["Womanizer", "Toxic", "Till the World Ends"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCircus.\n\n\tDebuting at number three, \"Circus\" was still a big hit for Spears who themed her sixth album and subsequent tour after the number.  Although the third spot on the list may seem rough for superstar Spears, her first single from the album, \"Womanizer\", topped the same chart becoming her first song to do so since \"...Baby One More Time\" way back in 1998 (which was her debut!).  Her later songs \"Hold It Against Me\" and \"3\" also topped the chart.\r Oidioid32123 brings us to Britney's world for this single. \n"}, {"text": "Australian alt-rock band Grinspoon charted the highest (on Australia's ARIA charts) with which of these singles?", "correct": "Hard Act to Follow", "options": ["Lost Control", "Ready 1", "Black Tattoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHard Act to Follow.\n\n\t\"Hard Act to Follow\" was the first single from Grinspoon's fourth album, \"Thrills, Kills & Sunday Pills\" (also a line from the song) and it reached number twenty-four on the ARIA Chart, cracking their repeated previous record of twenty-five.  Despite this, the album reached number four in Australia, spawning four singles.  Although relatively unknown outside Australia, they've been nominated for (and won) awards for their music in Australia since the late-1990s.\r Pollucci19 brings us another Australian track for the Setlist. \n"}, {"text": "The music video for what song by indie band Death Cab for Cutie was streamed live in a single take?", "correct": "You Are a Tourist", "options": ["Transatlanticism", "Soul Meets Body", "The Ghosts of Beverly Drive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou Are a Tourist.\n\n\tThe first single from their seventh disc, \"Codes and Keys\", \"You Are a Tourist\" showcased the popular sounds of Death Cab's oeuvre, pushing them to the top of three different Billboard charts in the U.S.  The music video is particularly important as all three band members performed alongside different dancers and performers, live, online; the whole thing was streamed in one go.  Their follow-up album, \"Kintsugi\", was released in 2015, hitting number eight on the Billboard 200; it was five slots lower than \"Codes and Keys\".\r Kyleisalive delves into an indie rock setlist to share this song. \n"}, {"text": "Although it shares the same name, which of these songs (by Lisa Miskovsky) was the main theme for the video game \"Mirror's Edge\", and not \"Portal\"?", "correct": "Still Alive", "options": ["Comfort You", "The Cake is a Lie", "May It Be"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStill Alive.\n\n\tWhile \"Portal\" popularized a song called \"Still Alive\" a year earlier, singer/songwriter Lisa Miskovsky created a different \"Still Alive\" for EA's popular parkour-themed action game \"Mirror's Edge\".  While the \"Portal\" incarnation was meant to be comedic, Miskovsky's song is much more heavily-produced to fit a more epic adventure.  Miskovsky is best known for her music in Sweden where \"Still Alive\" peaked at number twenty-nine on the Sweden Top 60 Chart.\r For this Setlist, Eburge brings in this dabbling of video game culture. \n"}, {"text": "Paul Weller begins what 1979 song by The Jam with \"It's funny how you never knew what my name was...\"?", "correct": "Little Boy Soldiers", "options": ["That's Entertainment", "Absolute Beginners", "The Modern World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLittle Boy Soldiers.\n\n\t\"Little Boy Soldiers\", while not an official single for the Paul Weller-fronted band The Jam, was still a popular number and featured many of the harmonies, catchy riffs, and enjoyable rock stylings the band was famous for.  Originally envisioned as a three-part song to be split between tracks on their \"Setting Sons\" album, The Jam instead placed it mid-way through the record.  \"Setting Sons\" reached number four on the UK Album Chart while the only single from the recording-- \"The Eton Rifles\"-- reached number three on the UK Singles Chart.\r Rowena8482 brought us this blast from the past. \n"}, {"text": "Returning from a hiatus, Australian rock band Powderfinger released which escapist single, reaching number five on the ARIA charts?", "correct": "Lost and Running", "options": ["My Happiness", "Who Really Cares", "All of the Dreamers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLost and Running.\n\n\tNominated for two ARIA Awards in 2007, \"Lost and Running\" was a return to the music scene for Powderfinger who, after six albums and a couple of years off, brought out this almost-anthemic rock tune on \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\", which went triple platinum down under.  It was their fourth number one album.  \"Lost and Running\" quickly became a concert staple for Powderfinger due to its catchy, repeated chorus.  The disbanded in 2010.\r Go figure, Aussiedrongo sent in this song, also Australian, for your listening pleasure. \n"}, {"text": "In what funky 1990 Living Colour song does singer Corey Glover sing \"oh no, please not that again\" before the song title?", "correct": "Love Rears Its Ugly Head", "options": ["Cult of Personality", "Glamour Boys", "Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove Rears Its Ugly Head.\n\n\tThough clearly a rock song, \"Love Rears Its Ugly Head\" clearly takes on different styles while evoking a relationship gone complicated.  This track from their \"Time's Up\" album (their second), hit number eight on the Billboard Modern Rock chart (not reaching the Hot 100) and number twelve on the UK Singles Chart.  That said, the album won the band their second of two Grammy Awards (of four nominations) in the early 1990s.  They're likely better known for their song \"Cult of Personality\".\r But who suggested the song?  It was Zonko who played this one. \n"}, {"text": "If you wanted to be with Christina Aguilera in 1999, there was a price to pay.  Probably because she was which of these in her debut song?", "correct": "Genie in a Bottle", "options": ["Beautiful", "Stronger", "Candyman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenie in a Bottle.\n\n\t\"Genie in a Bottle\" was the first single from now-pop-superstar Christina Aguilera.  Releasing in the same year as similarly-famous Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Genie in a Bottle\" ended up number one in many countries (including on the Billboard Hot 100).  She followed it up on her eponymous debut album with \"What a Girl Wants\".  Aguilera has since garnered one of pop music's most steadfast careers, appearing as a judge on \"The Voice\" multiple times over, starring in feature films, and going multi-platinum.  She won the Best New Artist Grammy in 2000, but lost Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for \"Genie in a Bottle\") to Sarah McLachlan for the live rendition of \"I Will Remember You\".  She'd win the Grammy in 2004 for \"Beautiful\" and again in 2007 for \"Ain't No Other Man\".\r Guitargoddess looks back to the turn of the century for this penultimate song. \n"}, {"text": "Pulling back from the heavier hits of their earlier albums, which of these singles appeared on Linkin Park's 2010 album \"A Thousand Suns\"?", "correct": "Waiting For the End", "options": ["Castle of Glass", "A Light That Never Comes", "Bleed It Out"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaiting For the End.\n\n\tWhile many of Linkin Park's earlier albums are fan favourites for their harder rock edge (and rap fusion), \"A Thousand Suns\" (and following release \"Living Things\") took on a bit more of a pop-rock edge while still holding true to the group's tendency to throw in hip-hop and reggae elements.  \"Waiting For the End\" epitomizes the new direction.  It pushed to number forty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 (though it showed on six different Billboard charts in the U.S., topping one of them) and went platinum.  \"A Thousand Suns\" went number one in seven different countries.\r No more waiting for any end; Darthrevan89 gave us the last song title for this Setlist. \n"}]}
