You must be careful while using the stepping stones, as you will die if you fall in the acid-like water.  The mojo room is blue, like all mojo rooms, and this mojo room does not require you to click O to access it.  Simply jump in. \n"}, {"text": "Are there any Goars in this level?", "correct": "Yes, in the mojo room", "options": ["Yes, in the mojo room and final battle", "Yes, in the final battle", "No"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes, in the mojo room.\n\n\tThe only Goars that appear in this level are in the mojo room.
