The earth worm's movement around the dirt aerates and mixes the soil, and even creates nutrients good for many plants. This makes the earth worm great for farmers and gardeners. Most worms will also take organic material like dead leaves and manure, and bring it down in the ground either to plug their burrow or to use as food.They usually tear the material to shreds, and they partially digest it. When it leaves the worm's body, it will mix with intestinal secretions, thus fertilizing the soil.By aerating the soil, the earthworm keeps open passages for water to drain into the soil for plants to pick up, and also makes easy passages for oxygen to travel. \n"}, {"text": "BRAIN TEASERS: OK, I will give you some synonyms of words and you must tell me what the real words are.
