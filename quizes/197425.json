Jack, though, isn't as much of a movie fan as he purports to be: during this discussion, he misquotes one of the most famous lines of dialogue ever spoken in an American film.  Which one?", "correct": "Network", "options": ["Cool Hand Luke", "Citizen Kane", "Psycho"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNetwork.\n\n\tJack admits to admiring \"Network\" (1976), and tries to reproduce the classic line \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\" shouted repeatedly by Howard Beale (Peter Finch).  Unfortunately, the closest Jack gets is, \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take any more of your stuff!\"  (He doesn't say \"stuff\" in the movie, but I'm not allowed to mention the word he actually says.  Use your imagination.) \n"}, {"text": "As an odd way of explaining his motives for becoming a kidnapper to harried father Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) references a classic science fiction film in \"Ransom\" (1996).

Wells' novel, the far-flung future is inhabited by beautiful, idyllic humans (the Eloi) and horrific subterranean creatures (the Morlocks) who perform all of the manual labor required to keep society running -- and, on occasion, abduct an Eloi.  Shaker compares himself to a Morlock, and Mullen to an Eloi. \n"}, {"text": "\"Scream\" (1996) makes both obvious and subtle references to quite a few horror films, but which film is being viewed by a room full of high school students when movie expert Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) feels compelled to explain to his peers what the \"rules\" are for surviving a horror movie?", "correct": "Halloween", "options": ["Psycho", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday the 13th"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHalloween.\n\n\tAll four of these films (and many more!) are referenced in \"Scream,\" but when Randy is giving his little speech, \"Halloween\" (1978) is playing on the TV behind him. \n"}, {"text": "In perhaps the creepiest scene of \"Mystic River\" (2003), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) reveals his dark side to his wife for the first time while watching a vampire movie on television.

Which film?", "correct": "The Wizard of Oz", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wizard of Oz.\n\n\tCarrie Fisher plays a \"special talent coordinator\" assigned to oversee the dozens of little people cast as munchkins in \"Oz.\"  It's not an entirely factual film, but it's a lot of fun! \n"}, {"text": "The well-meaning organizers of the bachelor party of latent homosexual Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) in \"In and Out\" (1997) bring along a movie that they think he'll enjoy.  It's not porn.  It stars Barbra Streisand.

He tends to recite long sections of dialogue from the films, and at one point, he draws the other characters into humming the theme song to the films (written by Nino Rota).  I'd criticize this particular obsession, but I share it (and surpass it), so I think I'll leave Glen alone. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Boiler Room\" (2000), bigwig Jim Young (Ben Affleck) makes sure to treat the young stockbrokers in his firm to a viewing of the film \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992). ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tJim shows his new employees \"Wall Street\" (1987).  I found this a fairly clever move, since \"Boiler Room\" echoes \"Wall Street\" quite a bit.  If the characters in the film acknowledge that fact, then there's not as much room to criticize the filmmakers for \"borrowing,\" right? \n"}, {"text": "During an intense gunfight in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984), Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) irritates his superior officer by referencing a classic American film.

Taggart is less than pleased with Billy's jovial comparison. \n"}, {"text": "Dozens of actual films are referenced in \"The Player\" (1992), but at the very beginning of the film, Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) discusses a particular Orson Welles film with an underling in a sequence that has to be one of the funniest self-referential Hollywood jokes of the 90's.  What's the film?", "correct": "Touch of Evil", "options": ["Citizen Kane", "Chimes at Midnight", "The Magnificent Ambersons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTouch of Evil.\n\n\tThe opening shot of \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) lasts for about three minutes without a single cut -- a technique almost unheard of in those days -- and the opening shot of \"The Player\", similarly, is a long, uninterrupted shot that \"floats\" in focus from one set of characters to another.  Director Robert Altman's opening shot winds up being much longer than Welles': it lasts almost eight minutes! \n"}, {"text": "\"Quiz Show\" (1994) focused on the 1950's TV game show \"Twenty-One,\" which was rigged.

What's the movie?", "correct": "Gilda", "options": ["The Seven Year Itch", "Gone With the Wind", "One Million Years B.C."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGilda.\n\n\tRed is watching Rita Hayworth strut her stuff in \"Gilda\" (1946).  The name of the Stephen King novella on which this film is based is called \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" so this scene is pretty important.\r If you folks liked this quiz, please let me know -- there's potentially a LOT more where this came from, if you want some more! \n"}]}
