{"id": "343543", "name": "The Sad Life of a Couch Quiz | TV Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "TV Mixture", "Name The Show"], "questions": [{"text": "This show is universally hated by the couches of the world. What is the name of the show that features a giant purple dinosaur and causes children to jump up and down with joy whenever it comes on?", "correct": "Barney and Friends", "options": ["Terra Nova", "Dinotopia", "Romper Room"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarney and Friends.\n\n\t\"Barney and Friends\", which debuted in 1992, is one of my least favorite television shows. Barney might be funny if you are a kid, but when you are an old couch, the bouncing of children can be very hard on your springs. Many an old couch has had to see a couchropractor after an episode of this show, just to have their springs realigned. \n"}, {"text": "Because the show was almost always filmed with a fat man sitting in a chair, which popular television show that ran from 1971-1979 was insulting to couches everywhere?", "correct": "All in the Family", "options": ["The Munsters", "Family Ties", "The Avengers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll in the Family.\n\n\tThe television program \"All in the Family\" was one of the most popular programs in the 1970s. It had such an impact on society that the two chairs of the main characters, Archie and Edith Bunker, were put on display at the Smithsonian Museum. I am sure the couch, easily seen throughout the show, would have worked just fine. \n"}, {"text": "When I was a new couch I was forced to watch a really silly show starring Sally Field. What was the name of this really bad comedy about a religious sister who had a problem with gliding around in the air?", "correct": "The Flying Nun", "options": ["The Pilot Pope", "Soaring Sister", "Hovering near Heaven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Flying Nun.\n\n\t\"The Flying Nun\" (1967-1970) was about a young nun who, after becoming a nun, learned that she had the ability to fly. And I do not mean in an airplane or helicopter. The premise was that her cornette, a headpiece that was part of her habit and looked like the wings of a plane, allowed her to fly around without flapping her arms like a bird. At this time most people only had one television and one couch. Being a couch at this time could mean five or six bottoms were occupying you at one time. \n"}, {"text": "While most people are unaware of it, couches can hear. Because of this, being forced to listen to which tabloid television talk show, hosted by the former mayor of Cincinnati, can be very hard to tolerate? ", "correct": "The Jerry Springer Show", "options": ["The Mike Douglas Show", "Oprah", "Judge Judy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Jerry Springer Show.\n\n\t\"The Jerry Springer Show\", which debuted in 1991, brought taboo subjects out into the open. Topics such as cross-dressing, incest, and zoophilia were explored. Being exposed to such topics was a very delicate matter for the couches of the world. I'm not sure what it says about our owners who sat glued to the set while the show was on. \n"}, {"text": "Which horrible cartoon television show involves a scene known as the \"couch gag\"?", "correct": "The Simpsons", "options": ["Scooby-Doo", "The Cosbys", "Family Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Simpsons.\n\n\tOne of the most horrible shows ever put on the air has got to be \"The Simpsons\", which debuted in 1989. The couch gag can be defined as a series of events that leads up to this dysfunctional family converging on their living room couch to watch television. Some of these events that are degrading to couches every where include the couch collapsing, the couch falling through the floor, and the couch falling over backwards. While the show does acknowledge the importance of the couch in daily family life, it never gives the couch the respect that it deserves. \n"}, {"text": "Which fantasy television show starring Shannen Doherty and Alyssa Milano insulted the intelligence of anyone who watched it, including the couch they occupied while watching it?", "correct": "Charmed", "options": ["Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Beverly Hills 90210", "Angel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharmed.\n\n\t\"Charmed\" (1998-2006) was an ignorant show about four sisters who were good witches. Furniture in the house was constantly destroyed by a variety of demons, monsters and mythical beasts only to reappear completely fixed in the next sequence. We couches are not stupid, in contrast to popular opinion. Being forced to support the rear ends of those fans who avidly watched this show was considered a fate worse than the dump for those couches had to endure each episode. \n"}, {"text": "As you have been told, couches can hear. Which television talent show, that first aired in 2002, has forced millions of couches to sit through some of the worst singing ever broadcast on television?", "correct": "American Idol", "options": ["The Singing Bee", "The Ed Sullivan Show", "X Factor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmerican Idol.\n\n\tSitting through episodes of \"American Idol\" has been forced on couches all over the U.S. Multiple episodes with terrible performers who think they can sing has damaged the hearing of couches everywhere. Supporting the butts of multiple people while listening to the sounds of screeching, yodeling, and moaning is nobody's idea of fun. \n"}, {"text": "One of the worst shows I was forced to endure featured Snow White and her family. What was the name of this sickening show that debuted in 1987?", "correct": "The Charmings", "options": ["Third Rock From the Sun", "Married with Children", "The Love Boat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Charmings.\n\n\t\"The Charmings\" was a horrible show based on the premise that Snow White and Prince Charming had been transported into modern day California. The costumes, the acting and the story-line were so bad that I was forced to see a psychiatrist who asked me to lay down on her couch. It was humiliating to say the least. \n"}, {"text": "Which reality television show about home redecorating, that ran from 2000-2008 on the TLC channel, struck fear into couches everywhere?", "correct": "Trading Spaces", "options": ["Family Ties", "Silver Spoons", "Martha Stewart Living"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrading Spaces.\n\n\tIn every episode of \"Trading Spaces\", furniture, including couches, were thrown away to end up in the dump while newer younger furniture took its place. When will the world realise that couches get better with age? Why didn't the producers of this awful show realize that throwing out this center of family life is almost a sin? The rooms in this terrible television show lost their homeyness and their uniqueness. They ended up looking like those plastic models seen on the front of magazines everywhere. \n"}, {"text": "One of the worst television shows I was ever forced to sit through started in 1965, starred Jerry Van Dyke, and was almost as nauseating as the smelly old sock that is hiding under my pillows. What show was this?", "correct": "My Mother the Car", "options": ["My Cousin the Couch", "My Father the Computer", "My Uncle the Candle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Mother the Car.\n\n\t\"My Mother the Car\" ran for one season starting in 1965. At that time there were no remote controls which I could hide in my depths and prevent my owners from changing the channel to this awful show. The show was about an antique car that was the reincarnation of the new owner's mother. Dead mom spoke through the radio. If it sounds stupid, believe me, it was. C'mon... you could have been just as creative if you made a show called \"My Cousin the Couch\"! \n"}]}
