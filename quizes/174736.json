{"id": "174736", "name": "Legends of the West: The Sundance Kid Trivia Quiz | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", "       U.S. History", "Old West"], "questions": [{"text": "The Sundance Kid was born in the spring of 1867, the last of five children.  Stunningly, Sundance was not his given name, nor was Kid his surname.  Rather, he was born...?  ", "correct": "Harry Longabaugh", "options": ["George Leigh", "William Carver", "Ben Kilpatrick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Longabaugh.\n\n\tThe Sundance Kid was born Harry Alonzo Longabaugh in the Spring of 1867 to Josiah and Annie Longabaugh.  His birth occurred in the small town of Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, not far from Philadelphia.  Like many other famous western outlaws, Harry was an easterner before he became a westerner. \n"}, {"text": "In 1882 the young Sundance headed west with his cousin George, looking for a new and adventurous life.  He soon found himself deeper in adventure than he probably could have calculated.  In 1887 he began serving an 18-month prison sentence for having committed which of these crimes?  ", "correct": "Horse theft", "options": ["Train robbery", "Attempted murder", "Extortion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorse theft.\n\n\tApparently young Harry did not settle well in the west, or perhaps he settled perfectly given the somewhat anarchic environment.  Whatever the case, in August of 1887 Harry was tried and convicted of horse theft, having stolen a horse and gear at the Triple V Ranch in Sundance, Wyoming.  He served out nearly the entire sentence, having finally been pardoned in February of 1889. \n"}, {"text": "The Sundance Kid acquired his nickname at the age of 22 after having served prison time.  How is it that he came to be known by the 'Sundance' nickname?  ", "correct": "From the town Sundance in Wyoming", "options": ["Because Harry was known to enjoy a frolic in the sun", "It was the name of the store he inherited from his grandfather", "His long, blonde curls were known to 'dance in the sun' while he rode a horse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom the town Sundance in Wyoming.\n\n\tAs was mentioned in the previous question, Harry served his longest period of incarceration in Sundance, Wyoming.  He later became known by the moniker 'The Sundance Kid' in honor of this fact.  Sundance was the county seat of Crook County, Wyoming. \n"}, {"text": "Before long Sundance was to hook up with several other outlaws with whom he would commit a number of famous train and bank robberies.  Everyone knows that The Sundance Kid was connected with another very famous outlaw, Butch Cassidy.  Which of the following individuals was also associated with Sundance?  ", "correct": "Kid Curry", "options": ["Cole Younger", "Jim French", "Doc Holliday"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKid Curry.\n\n\tWhile Jim French was associated with Billy the Kid, Doc Holliday was connected with the Earps, and Cole Younger with Jesse James, Harvey \"Kid Curry\" Logan was a member of the gang that also included Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.  William Carver and Ben Kilpatrick (The Tall Texan) were also long associated with the two outlaws.  All five of these men can be seen in a very famous picture taken of their gang while visiting Fort Worth, Texas.  The photo, taken at the John Swartz Studio, somehow managed to reach the Pinkerton Detective Agency, and a massive manhunt ensued for the members of this outlaw gang. \n"}, {"text": "Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, along with their outlaw associates, became known collectively as 'The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang', and also by which of the following names?  ", "correct": "The Wild Bunch", "options": ["The Savages", "The Dalton Gang", "The Mad Posse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wild Bunch.\n\n\t'The Wild Bunch' is a more specific name for the gang that included those mentioned in the previous question, while 'The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang' is a more generic term for various outlaws who used a naturally fortified redrock location in Johnson County, Wyoming called the Hole-in-the-Wall.  The Wild Bunch also used 'Brown's Hole' and 'Robber's Roost' as regular hideouts during the periods between their famous heists.  It's important to note that, while the members mentioned above were the most well-known, The Wild Bunch included various other individuals during its five year history that spanned from 1896 to 1901. \n"}, {"text": "Sundance was not only famously associated with Butch Cassidy, but also with a girlfriend whom he met in Texas.  What was the name of this gal who Sundance probably met in 1899?  ", "correct": "Etta Place", "options": ["Pearl Hart", "Emily Dyess", "Elizabeth Flood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEtta Place.\n\n\tEtta Place was probably given the name Ethel  (though her birth name is not known for certain) at her birth in Texas, circa 1880.  Apparently, Sundance and Etta were married in 1900, when she took the name Etta Place (the surname is Harry's mother's maiden name; an alias used by Sundance at various times in his life.) \n"}, {"text": "With the law hot on their trail, Sundance and Butch Cassidy decided it was time to leave the United States, and they did just that on February 20th, 1901.  On board which ship did they depart for Argentina on that date?  ", "correct": "Herminius", "options": ["Chubut", "Soldier Prince", "Honorius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerminius.\n\n\tAlong with Etta Place, the two outlaws made the long ride to Buenos Aires, Argentina in February of 1901.  The three other ships mentioned (Soldier Prince, Honorius, Chubut) carried Etta and Harry the following year when they made a visit to the United States, and subsequently returned to Argentina. \n"}, {"text": "Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid lived peaceably in Argentina for several years, but eventually the law caught up with them and they were forced to return to the outlaw lifestyle.  In which year were the two outlaws most likely gunned down after many years of pursuit?  \n", "correct": "1908", "options": ["1918", "1915", "1912"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1908.\n\n\tI say 'most likely' because suggestions persist that the two outlaws somehow managed to fake their deaths and returned surreptitiously to the United States.  It has also been suggested that Sundance and Butch committed suicide during the gunfight rather than be captured and face incarceration. \n"}, {"text": "In which South American country did the final stand of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, known as the San Vicente Shootout, take place?  ", "correct": "Bolivia", "options": ["Brazil", "Paraguay", "Chile"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBolivia.\n\n\tThis shootout took place on November 3rd, 1908 between the outlaws and local law enforcement officials.  It was reported that the day following the shootout the two 'bandidos yanqui' were buried at the cemetery in the small Bolivian town. \n"}, {"text": "In film, the name 'The Sundance Kid'  is associated with Robert Redford, who played the role of the famous gunslinger in the 1969 movie 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.

", "correct": "Utah", "options": ["Idaho", "Colorado", "Nevada"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUtah.\n\n\tRobert Redford bought Sundance from the Stewart family, who had run the ski resort called 'Timphaven' at the same location.  Redford's ski resort has become secondary to the Sundance Institute, which runs a world famous film festival featuring the work of independent filmmakers.
