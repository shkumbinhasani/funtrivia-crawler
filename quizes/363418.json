Since its inception in 1810 until German reunification in 1994, Oktoberfest always ran for 16 days ending on the first Sunday in October. Since 1994, the schedule has been modified so that if the first Sunday in October happens to fall on the 1st or 2nd of the month, then the festival carries on until the Monday.This was done to ensure that \"German Unity Day\", October 3rd, always falls within the Oktoberfest festivities. The traditional 16-day festival is therefore now extended by one or two days if either of the first two days in October is a Sunday. \n"}, {"text": "Billed as \"The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth\", which Canadian city has staged an annual Stampede every July since 1923?", "correct": "Calgary", "options": ["Saskatoon", "Winnipeg", "Vancouver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalgary.\n\n\tBeginning as a local agricultural fair in 1886, the Calgary Stampede was born when the rodeo first came to town in 1919 as a celebration to Honor soldiers returning home from WWI.
