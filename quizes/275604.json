{"id": "275604", "name": "\"Sly 2\" - The Museum (PS2) Quiz | Sly 2: Band of Thieves | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Sly Cooper Games", "Sly 2: Band of Thieves"], "questions": [{"text": "How many bones are on the skeleton in the museum?\n(Note, count the bottom jaw and the skull as one bone.)", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Eleven", "Nine", "Eight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tThe ten bones include the skull, a few vertebrae with ribs attached, and the tail.  The tail and the head are not connected to the ribcage, but are hung by separate wires. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following was not a picture on the walls of the museum?", "correct": "Clockwerk", "options": ["Muggshott", "Mona Lisa", "Panda King"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClockwerk.\n\n\tClockwerk was never on any picture.  If you look very closely, you can see the Mona Lisa on a darker part of the wall.  It is very easy to miss, but it is there.  Each picture should be familiar.  There are a few famous paintings throughout the building, but most of them are not.  Every picture involved previous enemies of yours, including Muggshott and Panda King.  There are also several pictures of enemies you will encounter in \"Sly 2.\"  Finally, you can find some pictures of Sly and his gang stealing various items. \n"}, {"text": "What animal is at the rendezvous point?", "correct": "Snake", "options": ["Bentley", "Murray", "Carmelita"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnake.\n\n\tMurray isn't there at first, although Sly was supposed to meet him there.  The rendezvous point has a giant snake statue at it, with the tail holding up the rope for you to cross.  Don't bother attacking it for loot.  You won't find any.  However, in later levels, there are some of the exact statues you can whack and break the jaw away for coins. \n"}, {"text": "What will happen if you jump down into the garden?", "correct": "You will lose some life", "options": ["You will be caught by the guards, thus having to start over", "You will lose your whole life, thus having to start over", "None of the above"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou will lose some life.\n\n\tJumping down will not be as bad as you may think.  Instead of being caught by a guard, or losing your life, you simply lose some of your life.  Don't fall too much, however, or you will eventually lose enough life to die.  The same is with the road.  You cannot jump down and get run over, or ride a vehicle.  You don't make it that far down.  You will only lose a bit of life. \n"}, {"text": "On the very first rope you come to, how many flags are there?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "Four", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tThere are two ropes with three flags on them.  There is also one with 5 flags to make a total of 11 flags.  The first and second flag have 3, while the 3rd rope has 5.  These ropes are scattered throughout the level. \n"}, {"text": "When you were in the alleyway on the rope, what did the giant neon sign say?", "correct": "Hotel", "options": ["None of the above", "Eat here", "Las Vegas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHotel.\n\n\tThis sign is in bright blue neon lights.  Later in the level, Carmelita stands on the sign while she is trying to chase you down.  Hopefully, you got away! \n"}, {"text": "What animal was the God in the second garden below the museum?", "correct": "Bird", "options": ["Cat", "None of the above", "Human"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBird.\n\n\tIt was a pharoah god.  The bird god had a long beak and a pharoah's hat above, but it was designed like an altar.  You can look down and see two flashlight guards guarding it.  It is quite a massive structure. \n"}, {"text": "How many sarcophagi are in the video?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Three", "Four", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe two sarcophagi hide Carmelita and Constable Neyla.  The Clockwerk parts had been stolen before Sly had gotten there.  The cops hid there hoping the thief would return to the theme of the crime.  Carmelita thought the thief was Sly.  This is where Neyla gives you an important clue. \n"}, {"text": "What is the color of Constable Neyla's scarf?", "correct": "Red with yellow flecks", "options": ["Yellow", "Yellow with red flecks", "Red"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed with yellow flecks.\n\n\tThe scarf is mainly red, but has some yellow flecks on it.  This is where you first meet Neyla, and she gives you an important clue for later.  She makes mention of the Klaww Gang, who stole the Clockwerk parts. \n"}, {"text": "If you go the opposite direction that you should run while being chased by Carmelita while still in the building, what will you find at the end of the path?", "correct": "Panda King Statue", "options": ["None of the above", "Murray", "A Giant Door"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPanda King Statue.\n\n\tThere is a giant Panda King statue at the end of the path.
