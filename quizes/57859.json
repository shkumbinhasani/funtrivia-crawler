{"id": "57859", "name": "Who Plays Whom in 'Harry Potter'? Online Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Harry Potter", "Sorcerer's Stone"], "questions": [{"text": "Who plays Hermione Granger in the movie?", "correct": "Emma Watson", "options": ["Emily Watson", "Emma Thompson", "Emma Woodhouse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEmma Watson.\n\n\tShe's prettier than Hermione in the book, but she does a good job. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Harry in the movie?", "correct": "Daniel Radcliffe", "options": ["Daniel Day Lewis", "Rory Culkin", "Danny Kaye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaniel Radcliffe.\n\n\tHe sure looks the part, and I think he does a good job, not a great one. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Professor McGonagall?", "correct": "Maggie Smith", "options": ["Vanessa Redgrave", "Julie Christie", "Lynn Redgrave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaggie Smith.\n\n\tShe does an excellent job. Her facial expressions are perfect. Rent 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' if you liked her in 'Harry Potter'--it's definitely for grown-ups, though. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Albus Dumbledore?", "correct": "Richard Harris", "options": ["Richard Burton", "Harrison Ford", "Richard Dreyfuss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Harris.\n\n\tHe has yards and yards of white hair and beard. Moviegoers will certainly miss Richard Harris, who died in 2002. He reportedly took the part of Dumbledore only because his granddaughter begged him to. He made three more films following \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\" A distinguished actor born in Limerick, Ireland, Harris shone in \"Unforgiven,\" \"A Man Called Horse,\" \"Mutiny on the Bounty,\" and \"This Sporting Life.\" He may be best known for the \"Harry Potter\" movies and for playing Arthur in \"Camelot,\" but in my opinion, these were not his best roles. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Ron Weasley?", "correct": "Rupert Grint", "options": ["Macaulay Culkin", "Robert Grant", "Robin Pinter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRupert Grint.\n\n\tI made up Robert Grant and Robin Pinter. Rupert has dazzling red hair and a funny nose. He may be the best of the child actors in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Hagrid?", "correct": "Robbie Coltrane", "options": ["Robert DeNiro", "John Coltrane", "John Cleese"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobbie Coltrane.\n\n\tHe's fantastic. Almost as good as the book character--this is probably the best performance in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Here's a harder one: Who plays Mr. Ollivander, the wand maker and merchant in Diagon Alley?", "correct": "John Hurt", "options": ["George Harrison", "John Cleese", "Tom Cruise"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Hurt.\n\n\tA great, though short performance. Maybe he should have played Dumbledore. \n"}, {"text": "Who plays Nearly Headless Nick?", "correct": "John Cleese", "options": ["John Hurt", "Nick Nolte", "Nicholas Cage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Cleese.\n\n\tAnother terrific, too short, performance from the star of Fawlty Towers. \n"}, {"text": "Which detail is missing from the movie?", "correct": "The Sorting Hat sorts the First Years in alphabetical order.", "options": ["Voldemort shows his face.", "Hagrid brings Harry a birthday cake.", "Harry speaks to a snake."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Sorting Hat sorts the First Years in alphabetical order.\n\n\tIn the movie, the Hat sorts Ron Weasley before Harry Potter. \n"}, {"text": "Which event does the movie include that the book DOESN'T?", "correct": "Flying keys slam into a door.", "options": ["Harry gets a Christmas sweater.", "Ron and Harry save Hermione from a troll.", "Neville loses his toad on the train."], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlying keys slam into a door.\n\n\tWhen the keys slam into the door, it reminds me of a much gorier scene in the movie 'Carrie.' \n"}]}
