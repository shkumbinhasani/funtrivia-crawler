{"id": "406603", "name": "\"Thirst\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "Doris is forced to go to the hospital in which city?", "correct": "Hyannis", "options": ["Boston", "Sandwich", "Provincetown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHyannis.\n\n\tHarry finds Doris scrubbing their daughter in the shower.  Though it appears nothing is wrong, at least to Harry, Doris informs him that Alma was in the nearby graveyard sucking the blood from the entrails of a dead rabbit.  She's taking her to the doctor; something is clearly wrong.\r At the same time, Chief Burelson knocks on the Gardners' door.  What with the murders along the cape, it seems only reasonable to follow up on leads, and she's received calls from locals regarding Alma being seen in the neighbourhood, covered in blood.  She asks Harry and Doris if she can bring Alma in to the station-- alone-- though no one is too keen to let this questioning occur.  Doris, in an effort to protect her daughter, tries to block the chief from coming upstairs, but it's then that she suffers a severe cramp as a result of her pregnancy.  An ambulance is called.\r Fortunately, the baby is okay.  It appears that false contractions have occurred, brought on by stress.  The doctor advises that Doris stay under hospital supervision for four or five days, much to her dismay.  Harry sends Alma out to grab something from the vending machine while they talk about this turn of events, but on the way out, it seems clear that Alma is more interested in the IV bags of blood on a cart outside instead of any normal food.\r Harry sees the benefit in Doris staying at the hospital in Hyannis since Provincetown gives her nothing but anxiety.  She insists that he and Alma stay in a motel; he one-ups her, suggesting he'll bring Alma back to New York instead.  This is a lie, however.  He drives himself and his daughter back along the Cape and forces her to admit she took the pill.  It's a talk that forces both of them to come to terms with their situation.  Harry asks her to stop taking the pill, but she says she only will if he stops as well. \n"}, {"text": "What is Harry's vow to Alma?", "correct": "That she will never need to hunt for sustenance", "options": ["That he will stop taking the pills", "That she will always be the first to eat", "That they will remove Doris from the equation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat she will never need to hunt for sustenance.\n\n\tBack in the house in Provincetown, Harry sits in front of his computer without an idea.  Realizing his reliance on the pill, he takes the bag out of the trash and pops one into his mouth.  Alma, standing nearby the entire time, holds out her hand for one as well, and he's forced to give her one.  That was the deal.\r At The Muse, the pair order steak-- very rare-- as Harry admits to her that he hasn't always been the best father.  Despite this, he aims to be hands-on in helping her navigate their new life.  While he can stockpile scripts for a few months on the pill, Alma has to play consistently, so she doesn't get the opportunity to have a break from her needs.  All she wants to do is play music.  In fact, she wants to know why they don't just leave Doris behind since she doesn't have a speck of talent or meaningful aspiration.  Harry refuses to let this happen, however, and chastises his daughter for thinking this way.  The most important thing is that Harry will protect Alma and bring her what she needs to survive; she must never get her own blood.  Alma lets him know she's already hungry. \n"}, {"text": "Harry follows a Craigslist ad to his next victim, but finds which of these waiting for him?", "correct": "Imprisonment", "options": ["The police", "Doris", "TB Karen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nImprisonment.\n\n\tActing on his vow to protect and help Alma, Harry hops onto Craigslist and does what he was taught, heading out to South Wellfleet under the guise of purchasing a stolen bike.  Arriving at his destination he asks the seller if he can come inside and she, being a woman home alone with a strange man, asks to see his ID, a request he complies with.  He apologizes for what he plans to do, but he's knocked out from behind by the butt of a gun.\r It turns out Harry was the one to fall into the trap.  He wakes up in the house's basement with his hands bound and missing.  A chart of rules is posted to the wall, and when his captors return, they inform him that it'll be his last night alive.  What unfolds, as they hand him a Viagra, is the information that they plan to feature him in a snuff film.  As the pair set up their camera, however, Harry is able to gnaw through his bindings, attack the couple, and get the upper hand.  He feeds on the woman, but shoots the man to let him bleed out slowly.\r When he brings a Thermos of blood home for Alma and serves it to her in a soup bowl, she eats it ravenously. \n"}, {"text": "Ursula informs Harry that who of these wants him to write a script?", "correct": "Quentin Tarantino", "options": ["Martin Scorcese", "Francis Ford Coppola", "Steven Spielberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQuentin Tarantino.\n\n\tHarry is surprised when his agent, Ursula, shows up out of the blue, having come in from a visit to New York City to check in on him.  She comes bearing good news as well; it seems that Quentin Tarantino wants him to write his very first limited series, and it's already been picked up at Hulu sight unseen.  It's particularly interesting because Tarantino tends to write his own material.\r Ursula has to admit that she's come out with an ulterior motive though.  Harry's changed since he's shacked up in Provincetown; his writing is different and more inspired and she wants to know why.  She decides to get a room in a hotel nearby for a couple of days and she departs when Alma, calling from upstairs, says she's hungry again.  Harry warns her as she leaves that she shouldn't walk around in Provincetown at night but Ursula says she carries mace.  He's not too sure that'll help. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mickey, when was the last time he did drugs?", "correct": "A few days before Ursula's arrival", "options": ["A few years ago", "When he woke up", "When his mother passed away"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA few days before Ursula's arrival.\n\n\tUrsula ends up at the bar at The Muse on her first evening in Provincetown.  While Mickey watches her from down the bar, she struggles with listening to Belle and Austin duet to \"Too Much, Too Little\" (by Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams) at the piano.  She asks the waiter to ask the pair to stop but the writers catch wind and confront her.  Before Ursula tucks into her dinner, Mickey offers to buy her a drink.  She refuses, however, leaving altogether instead of finishing her meal.\r Mickey follows Ursula out of the bar and asks her if she can do him one favour.  He's written several scripts in the past four days and having an agent look at even the first ten pages would mean a lot.  Despite her obvious initial hesitation, she takes the stack and promises to read them that evening...or else toss them into the fireplace.  To her utter amazement, as she hops into bed with the material, she's enraptured from the first page. \n"}, {"text": "Ursula suggests that Mickey's screenplays are how valuable?", "correct": "$3,000,000 per", "options": ["Worthless; no more than fire-starter", "Invaluable; they should be in a museum", "$50,000 per"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$3,000,000 per.\n\n\tUrsula calls Mickey back to The Muse for afternoon drinks the day after she reads his scripts and she suggests that they're $3,000,000 screenplays-- every one of them-- and she questions how he could possibly have pulled himself together to write them.  Considering the presence of not only Harry, who couldn't write like he does to save his life, Austin, Belle Noir, and now Mickey, she can't wrap her head around what makes Provincetown an apparent Mecca for writers.  What she can't come to terms with, most of all, is that Mickey is that talented.  He's quick to admit the truth-- that it's a pill-- and he knows the others are taking them.  Ursula wants exclusive access to them, including to their source, and she's not willing to hear about the side effects.  If he gets the pills, then his scripts won't go directly into the trash.\r That night, when Belle, Austin, and Harry drive off to get themselves their needed satiation, Mickey breaks into Belle's home and searches her belongings for that which he seeks-- and he hits the mother lode. \n"}, {"text": "Austin and Belle, discovering that Alma has taken the pill, realize that they will need to kill Harry to protect themselves.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAustin, Belle, and Harry feed on an entire household of people, arriving under the guise of coming to purchase a coin collection.  While they take their nourishment, Harry finds a Thermos under the sink and fills it with blood from his victim while the others watch his unexpected technique.  On the way back into Provincetown, Austin and Belle stop the car and aim a gun at him, asking who the blood's really for.  He has to admit the truth; it's for Alma.  The others force Harry to comply.  Alma is allowed no more pills or they'll feed on her.  As he returns home, the other two know that they'll need to kill him and Alma both.\r The next morning, Mickey finds a fellow addict under the docks and goes in to attack with his knife.  Mickey's not able to overpower the man, but he is able to get the upper hand, slicing the man's achilles tendon before bringing him down and feasting on him in the cold surf. \n"}, {"text": "What is Holden Vaughn's profession?", "correct": "Interior designer", "options": ["Musician", "Writer", "Theatre actor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInterior designer.\n\n\tMickey returns home to find Belle Noir already sitting at the table in his shack having just walked into the unlocked front door.  He apologizes for stealing the pills, but the result is clear.  He hasn't turned into one of the pale creatures, so it can be assumed that his talent is enough.  Belle knocks him down a peg, however, claiming he's a paper airplane and she's a 747; he shouldn't feel like he's flying at her level.  She cuts a deal.  Every time he kills, he's required to bring Belle a Thermos of blood.  On top of that, his first kill will be Ursula on account of her criticism of Belle's singing.\r Chief Burelson's men find the body at the docks and, fortunately for her, there's a witness.  Though interior designer Holden Vaughn was too far down the beach to help, he believes it was a gay-bashing incident, clear as day. \n"}, {"text": "Ursula leverages which of these intellectual properties in an attempt to get information out of Mickey?", "correct": "Speed Racer", "options": ["Sailor Moon", "Evangelion", "Attack on Titan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed Racer.\n\n\tMickey arrives at the local inn, The Land's End, with a crowbar in hand.  Breaking into Ursula's room, he finds her relaxing in the bathtub.  As he brandishes a knife, she has to ask-- \"are you here to murder me and drink my blood?\"  He doesn't want to, especially since he wants the career momentum, and when Ursula waves the possibility of a script option for the remake of \"Speed Racer\", Mickey puts down the weapon. \"Speed Racer\" is worth more than just mercy, however.  She wants the source.  Fortunately, Mickey knows the source's house, and the source is only known as The Chemist.  Ursula plans to take a trip there as she has a proposition to make. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Police Chief Burelson?", "correct": "Alma", "options": ["Harry", "Mickey", "Ursula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlma.\n\n\tUrsula and Mickey arrive at the Chemist's house despite the obvious advice not to go, and when they do, Ursula is able to get five minutes of the woman's time.  It's an action that forces the Chemist to visit Belle and Austin.  Ursula, offering a cut of the profits for as many pills as she can get, is rebuffed at every opportunity, especially since she could take them and, theoretically, reverse engineer them.  The Chemist is confident that it would give the ingredients, surely, but it wouldn't give the information as to how she cooks them up.  Ursula gives the straight deal-- 10% of earnings off deals with her fifteen top writers in addition to profits off the back-end.  It would make her the richest woman in Cape Cod.  The Chemist wants things the way they are though; she insists to Austin and Belle that they will need to kill her, Mickey, and Harry if they want to see another pill.  They can get rid of Harry's wife and kid as well.  Non-negotiable.\r Harry, packing Thermoses into a backpack, thanks Ursula for looking after Alma while he heads out to check on Doris at the hospital in Hyannis.  Alma asks her father to hurry; she's hungry.  Ursula heads to bed for a nap while Alma spies a knife on the nearby countertop, and as Harry heads out, Chief Burelson rings the doorbell.  Alma lets her in to talk for a little bit, and the chief tries to get answers, but the situation escalates.  As Burelson tries to take her to the station, Alma stabs her with the knife.\r When Harry returns home with the blood he's gone to retrieve, he finds the police chief dead and bleeding out on the table while Ursula teaches his daughter gin rummy, unfazed by the body in the other room. \n"}]}
