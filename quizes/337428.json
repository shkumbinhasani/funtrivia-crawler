Average [C]"], "questions": [{"text": "The first thing I notice as I enter the hotel is the strong smell of dog.  I am allergic to dogs, so this is unpleasant.  Nowhere did it say there would be a small doggie daycare place in the lobby.  I begin sneezing almost immediately; however, it's not the fur I'm allergic to. What is the layer under the fur that causes most pet allergies?", "correct": "Dander", "options": ["Dandy Fur", "Dandruff", "Dandelion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDander.\n\n\tDander is the layer of thin fur that is underneath the regular layer of fur.  Many breeds have dander, which is small and light enough to be carried by the air.  This is what many are allergic to, and not the fur itself.  Some dogs do not cause allergies, even though they have fur, because they do not have dander such as bichon frises and poodles. \n"}, {"text": "I am given a swipe-key to my room, and the first thing I notice is that it is completely blank.  I ask why this is so and they told me that I would realize why when I got to my room.\n\nI stuck the blank swipe-key in my wallet and went up to my room.  For a normal swipe-key card, what is the number one reason why you should not keep it in your wallet?", "correct": "It may become desensitized", "options": ["It might fall out of your wallet", "It might get folded and wrinkly", "You would lose it in there"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt may become desensitized.\n\n\tA swipe-key may actually become desensitized if you put it in your wallet.  If it is too close to a card with a magnetic stripe/field the swipe-key can actually stop working.\r I went to my room, and noticed that there was simply a door knob on the door; no lock whatsoever.  I went inside, and saw a small slot where the card would stay.  Placing the swipe-key card into it put it over the door a little bit.  It was the only way to lock the room.  \"Great\", I thought \"This is my only security during my stay.\" \n"}, {"text": "I wanted to rest on the bed for a bit, but I noticed the bed was not even made.  It looked as though the sheets weren't even clean.\n\nIn 2011, a woman earned a Guinness World Record for making a king-sized bed.  Where was this feat accomplished?", "correct": "London", "options": ["Paris", "Rome", "Berlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLondon.\n\n\tIn London, a competition for making a king-sized bed took place.  Louise Waller won the competition, for making the bed more quickly than anyone else.  This involved putting on a mattress cover, a bed sheet, a duvet and duvet cover, a bed runner, and two pillows with pillowcases.  This hotel housekeeper was able to accomplish this feat in only 95 seconds!  It was to look professionally done as well, not just sloppily thrown on the bed.  Louise managed to make the sheets and duvet look neat and tidy, and even tucked the sheets around the bed. \n"}, {"text": "I decided I would watch a little TV, so I opened the doors to the armoir and was shocked to see a very small television set with a very expensive list of what channels you could watch.  I couldn't even get a news channel on the small TV without paying $22.50 an hour.  It's a good thing I brought my DSi to pass the time. What company makes the DSi?", "correct": "Nintendo", "options": ["Sony", "Apple", "Dell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNintendo.\n\n\tThe Nintendo DSi was released in 2008 in Japan, and in 2009 in many other parts of the world.  It was the successor of the Nintendo DS.  The handheld touchscreen console comes in many colors, and can play both DS games and Gameboy games. \n"}, {"text": "I decided I needed to swim some laps to keep my mind off the terrible room.  I went down to the pool and hopped in.  It wasn't very deep; only 3 feet the entire way across.  It wasn't big, either but that didn't matter as much as the water itself.  My eyes immediately burned so badly I had to get out right away.  They had obviously used WAY too much of this element commonly put in pools.", "correct": "Chlorine", "options": ["Oxygen", "Sodium", "Iodine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChlorine.\n\n\tChlorine is often added to pools because it is a harmless chemical element that kills bacteria.  If there was no chlorine in a pool, it would start growing all sorts of bacteria, and the pool would become unsafe.  However, too much chlorine and many people's eyes start to water, become red and puffy, and itch. \n"}, {"text": "As I left the pool area, I noticed they had no towels for me to dry off.  So there I stood, dripping wet, hoping to air dry in the hot, humid pool room.\n\nOf what material are most hotel towels made?", "correct": "Cotton", "options": ["Nylon", "Silk", "Polyester"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCotton.\n\n\tMost hotel towels are made of cotton, because they are soft and absorb quite a bit of water from the body.  Sometimes they have a cotton blend.  Hotel towels are usually white and simple.  Most hotels also have separate towels in the room and in the pool area.  The pool towels are slightly larger. \n"}, {"text": "I went back up to my room (which was on Floor 6, and there are no elevators in this hotel) and was very thirsty.  I noticed a bottle of water on the table.  I went over to it and drank the entire thing.\n\nIf you see a bottle of water in your hotel room, is it complimentary?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tMost hotels that have bottles of water on the table will charge you if it is missing.  This water is usually very expensive so the hotel can make a profit.\r I was very upset when I finished drinking the bottle of water and realized this hotel had charged me $8.95 for it. \n"}, {"text": "The water didn't quite do the trick.  I wanted something different to drink.  I had seen a coffee shop downstairs, perhaps they had some iced coffee to drink.  All they had was black coffee.  I ordered some and didn't finish it because they overbrewed it and it was very bitter.\n\nWhat coffee shop uses a mermaid as a logo?", "correct": "Starbucks", "options": ["Dazbog", "Seattle's Best", "Human Bean"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStarbucks.\n\n\tStarbucks was founded in Seattle in 1971.  It also owns Seattle's Best Coffee and the Tazo Tea Company.  Starbucks is well known for their round green logo which features a mermaid on it. \n"}, {"text": "I decided I needed a rest.  I went to the lobby to relax on the couches but all I saw were chairs that looked like a basket-weave that had flimsy cushions on them.  They were terribly uncomfortable.  What is a chair that looks like a basket-weave called?", "correct": "Wicker", "options": ["Wiccan", "Wicket", "Wicked"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWicker.\n\n\tWicker furniture is very similar to wicker baskets.  Sometimes they are made out of wood, and become very splintery in the sun after too long, but others are made out of a rubbery plastic composite material that is much more comfortable.\r Unfortunately for me, these were made out of splintery wood wicker and the cushions were only as thick as my Snuggie (a blanket with sleeves). \n"}, {"text": "After such a long day, I decided to call it a night.  I didn't dare sleep in the bed, since I had no idea who had it before me, so I slept on the floor.  When I turned out the lights and lay down, I heard noises.  Then something crawled across my foot.  I leaped up and turned on the light and found the culprit.  I shrieked.  What insect usually only comes out of hiding when all the lights go off?", "correct": "Cockroach", "options": ["Ant", "Cricket", "Earwig"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCockroach.\n\n\tCockroaches usually come out when it's dark, so often you won't even know they are there until the lights go off.\r I knew that where there was one cockroach there were possibly thousands more lurking nearby, so I decided I wasn't going to stay in this hotel any longer.  I packed my bag and rushed downstairs to leave the hotel.  I demanded a refund, but they refused.  So I paid for an outrageously expensive room that was far below my standards. \n"}]}
