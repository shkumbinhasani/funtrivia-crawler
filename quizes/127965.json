Johns"], "questions": [{"text": "What is Biggles' first name ?", "correct": "James", "options": ["David", "Peter", "Raymond"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames.\n\n\tIt is strange that the name \"James\" only comes up in a few books such as \"The Boy Biggles\". His initials are J.C. but Captain W.E.Johns never revealed what the \"C\" stood for. Even Biggles' only love, Marie, called him \"Beegles\" rather than by his first name. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Biggles' brother ?", "correct": "Charles", "options": ["David", "James", "Roger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles.\n\n\tCharles Bigglesworth is only mentioned in the very early WW1 books. Unlike Biggles he seems to have been ideally cut out for joining the army. At school he was Head Boy and an all round success. At first young James (Biggles) believes he will never live up to his older brother. \n"}, {"text": "What relation is Biggles to Algy ?", "correct": "cousin", "options": ["brother", "no relation at all", "uncle"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncousin.\n\n\tWhen Biggles is in 266 squadron in WW1 he learns that his younger cousin -Algernon Montgomery Lacey (Algy) is being sent to his squadron so that he can look after him. Very soon Biggles and Algy are best friends. It is on the friendship and comradeship that W.E.Johns concentrates for all the rest of the books. \n"}, {"text": "What is Lord Bertie's surname ?", "correct": "Lissie", "options": ["Lacey", "Leslie", "Lowndes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLissie.\n\n\tLord Bertie Lissie is first introduced in \"Spitfire Parade\", the collection of \"Biggles\" stories that are about the \"Battle of Britain\". Later he joins Biggles, Algy and Ginger as a founder member of the special Air Police set up by Air Commodore Raymond. \n"}, {"text": "In which WW1 squadron do Biggles and Algy first serve together ?", "correct": "266", "options": ["306", "271", "666"], "explanation": "\n\n\n266.\n\n\tIn WW2 Biggles is given his own squadron which is numbered 666 and known to everyone as \"Biggles' Squadron\". Major Mullen is in charge of 266 where Biggles is a Flight Commander during part of WW1. \n"}, {"text": "Which part of England does Ginger come from ?", "correct": "north", "options": ["west", "south", "east"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnorth.\n\n\tIn later books Ginger declares he comes from Yorkshire. However, in \"Biggles and the Black Peril\" when he makes his first appearance he says he has come from north of Newcastle and he first meets Biggles probably somewhere in County Durham. It is one of W.E.Johns' famous mistakes but \"north\" is definitely the right answer. \n"}, {"text": "Which company made the famous \"Camel\" aircraft flown by Biggles in World War 1 ?", "correct": "Sopwith", "options": ["Hawker", "De Havilland", "Avro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSopwith.\n\n\tThe first collection of \"Biggles\" stories was called \"The Camels are Coming\".

Oddly, in spite of them being together for at least fifty years, Raymond nearly always calls Biggles by his full surname \"Bigglesworth\". He shares this habit with the series villain - Erich von Stalhein \n"}, {"text": "In which book does Ginger first appear ?", "correct": "Biggles and the Black Peril", "options": ["Biggles Pioneer Air Fighter", "Biggles & Co", "Biggles Flies South"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBiggles and the Black Peril.\n\n\tThe creation of the character of Ginger was a deliberate move by W.E. Johns to ensure that young boys read his stories. The early \"Biggles\" stories were aimed at the adult market. Ginger became Biggles' most favoured colleague, appearing in nearly all the adventures after \"Biggles and the Black Peril\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the German spy who is Biggles' only love ?", "correct": "Marie Janis", "options": ["Marie Schultz", "Lydia Brunning", "Helga Brunn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarie Janis.\n\n\tNot many \"Biggles\" fans seem to know that Marie Janis appears again in the much later book \"Biggles Looks Back\".

He had a very orthodox military career compared with Biggles' service in the Royal Flying Corps. His loss possibly contributes to Biggles' isolation and times of near despair during the worst periods of the war. \n"}, {"text": "What was Biggles' rank when he joined the Air Police after World War 2 ?", "correct": "sergeant", "options": ["constable", "commander", "inspector"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsergeant.\n\n\tLater Biggles makes it up the ranks to inspector.
