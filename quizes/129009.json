{"id": "129009", "name": "X2: X-Men United Multiple Choice Quiz | X-Men", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "X-Men", "X2"], "questions": [{"text": "Early in the film, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) arrives at the supposedly abandoned research facility that Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) told him about at the end of the first 'X-Men' film.  Finish the first two words of its name, as seen on the plaque that Wolverine discovers:  \"Alkalai __________.\"", "correct": "Lake", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake.\n\n\tPresumably named for the lake being held back by the ill-fated dam above the subterranean facility.  The plaque reads \"Alkali Lake Industrial Facility,\" and then some small print that I'll reproduce here once I own the film on DVD.  =) \n"}, {"text": "Ororo \"Storm\" Munroe (Halle Berry), noticing the unusual markings all over the skin of Kurt \"Nightcrawler\" Wagner (Alan Cumming), asks Kurt just how many of the markings he has.  According to Kurt's reply, how many markings has he imbedded or carved into his own skin?", "correct": "He doesn't specify how many", "options": ["182", "202", "42"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe doesn't specify how many.\n\n\tKurt explains that they are meant to signify \"angelic symbols,\" and says only that he has \"one for every sin...that's quite a few.\"  He never gives Ororo a number. \n"}, {"text": "One of the reasons that Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) hates Charles Xavier so much is because Stryker's son was once placed in Xavier's care, and wound up in a state that the colonel deemed unsatisfactory.  What is the name of Stryker's son?", "correct": "Jason", "options": ["Mason", "Austin", "Justin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason.\n\n\tMichael Reid MacKay plays Jason Stryker -- or, as his father calls him, \"Mutant 143\" (the character is called \"Jason 143\" in the closing credits). \n"}, {"text": "Stryker's son is an immensely powerful telepath and illusionist.  He uses his powers to \"persuade\" Xavier into using a Cerebro device for his father's dark purposes.  The primary illusion used for this strategy is a young girl who leads Xavier through a series of tasks.  Something is strange about this girl's appearance.  What is it?", "correct": "She has two differently-colored eyes.", "options": ["She has three eyes.", "She has one eye.", "She has no eyelids."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe has two differently-colored eyes.\n\n\tThe illusory little girl (played by Keely Purvis) has one blue eye and one green eye...just like Jason Stryker, the man \"creating\" her. \n"}, {"text": "Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a shape-shifter, imitates a number of people throughout the film.  In one scene, she imitates a woman who looks suspiciously like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos without the blue make-up, in order to seduce an unsuspecting security guard who oversees the captivity of Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen).  What is the name of the gorgeous blonde whom Mystique pretends to be in order to seduce the guard?", "correct": "Grace", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrace.\n\n\tMystique tells the guard that her name is Grace.  I'm guessing that Romijn-Stamos was quite relieved to play a few scenes without going through hours and hours of make-up for a change...and I was pleased (to say the least) to see the real Rebecca, even though it was only for a few minutes.  =) \n"}, {"text": "Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu) spends most of the film as nothing more than what appears to be Colonel Stryker's personal attache...but eventually, she is revealed to be a match for Wolverine thanks to some genetic enhancements.  In the comics, her character goes by the code-name Lady Deathstrike.  Who actually speaks the words \"Lady Deathstrike\" in the film?", "correct": "No one does", "options": ["Yuriko herself", "Stryker", "Wolverine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo one does.\n\n\tEven though the press releases for \"X2\" were fairly dripping with the words \"Lady Deathstrike,\" no one in the film ever calls her by that name.  She is simply called \"Yuriko\" in dialogue...although the closing credits do list her as \"Yuriko/Deathstrike.\" \n"}, {"text": "We meet the family of Bobby \"Iceman\" Drake (Shawn Ashmore) about halfway through the film.  Bobby has a younger brother.  What is his name?", "correct": "Ronny", "options": ["Terry", "Billy", "Tommy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRonny.\n\n\tRonny Drake (played by the improbably-named James Kirk!), clearly envious of his brother, is actually the one who betrays Bobby by summoning the police while several fugitive X-Men seek refuge at the Drake home. \n"}, {"text": "Colonel Stryker uses a syringe filled with the secretions from his son's brain (yuck) as a drug of sorts to enslave several people throughout the film.  Who is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Professor X", "options": ["Cyclops (James Marsden)", "Magneto", "Nightcrawler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nProfessor X.\n\n\tNightcrawler's attack on the White House at the start of the film happened only because Stryker used the drug -- we can tell this by the telltale mark on the back of Kurt's neck -- to compel him to ambush the President.  Stryker also used the drug to force Magneto to tell him all about Xavier, the school, and Cerebro. Cyclops was \"brainwashed\" into attacking his true love, Jean Grey, thanks to the drug...although he was given said drug off-screen.  Once Stryker has Xavier in custody, he explains that, as effective as the drug is, it won't work on a telepath of Xavier's caliber; instead, Stryker is forced to wheel his son into close proximity to Xavier, and let Jason overwhelm Xavier's considerable mental abilities face-to-face. \n"}, {"text": "In a bit of a tease, a particular character from the X-Men comics appears in this film, but only in his \"civilian identity\" -- i.e. not as an actual \"super-hero\"...at least, not yet.  Which character can be seen briefly in the film, but only as a \"civilian\"?", "correct": "Beast", "options": ["Angel", "Cable", "Bishop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeast.\n\n\tAt one point, we see an expert on mutation named Dr. Hank McCoy appearing on a televised news program.  In the comics, Hank McCoy is the brilliant, bombastic, blue-furred Beast.  Director Bryan Singer has stated several times that he is quite a fan of the character...and, since several production sketches of the Beast can be found on the \"X-Men\" DVD, it might be reasonable to assume that Dr. McCoy (and no, don't ask him to beam you up) just might be appearing in \"X3\"...sporting blue fur, perhaps.  One can hope! \n"}, {"text": "Storm and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), on orders from Xavier, look for the elusive Nightcrawler in a prominent American city.  Which one?", "correct": "Boston, MA", "options": ["Los Angeles, CA", "Philadelphia, PA", "Chicago, IL"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston, MA.\n\n\tI have no idea why Nightcrawler hangs out in Boston -- as far as I know, he has no connection to that city in the comics.  (Incidentally, Bobby Drake's family also resides in Boston...but I'm not sure how that little coincidence served the plot of this film.  Oh, well.) \n"}, {"text": "Three of these characters appear in BOTH \"X2: X-Men United\" and the original \"X-Men\" (2000).  Which one of them does NOT?", "correct": "Sabretooth", "options": ["Pyro", "Kitty Pryde", "Jubilee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSabretooth.\n\n\tPyro, Kitty Pryde, and Jubilee all appeared briefly in \"X-Men\"...and while they all appear in \"X2\" as well, they're ALL played by different actors!  Sabretooth is in \"X-Men,\" but he does not appear -- nor is he even mentioned -- in \"X2\".  Apparently, Magneto needs no more back-up than Mystique this time around.  Sabretooth and Toad must look pretty funny on the unemployment line. \n"}, {"text": "In \"X-Men\", Wolverine stole Cyclops' motorcycle.  In \"X2\", he continues the theme by stealing Cyclops' car.  Of what make is the car?", "correct": "Mazda", "options": ["BMW", "Porsche", "Aston-Martin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMazda.\n\n\tMazda has actually been using footage from this film as press for its product! \n"}, {"text": "Rogue (Anna Paquin) has the ability to \"steal\" the powers of other mutants.  Whose powers does she NOT steal in this film?", "correct": "Wolverine's", "options": ["Iceman's", "She steals all of their powers", "Pyro's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWolverine's.\n\n\tAfter kissing Iceman, Rogue breathes out a stream of ice-cold breath, and is clearly feeling the rush of Bobby Drake's powers.  Later in the film, she absorbs Pyro's powers in order to stop his rampage and extinguish the flames he has unleashed upon representatives of the Boston police department.  Rogue absorbs Wolverine's healing ability twice in the original \"X-Men\", but never does so at all in \"X2\". \n"}, {"text": "As Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) are escaping the siege at the X-Mansion in Cyclops' car, Pyro suddenly gets the urge to turn on the car's radio.  Wolverine immediately grimaces in disgust at the song piping through the speakers and turns off the radio.  Whose song was it?", "correct": "N*SYNC", "options": ["Backstreet Boys", "Christina Aguilera", "Britney Spears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nN*SYNC.\n\n\tThe song was \"Bye Bye Bye\".  I'm with Wolverine, of course.  Ugh. \n"}, {"text": "In an awkward moment at the Drake house, Bobby improvises and tells his parents a lie -- namely, that Wolverine is a \"professor\" at the Xavier Institute.  Wolverine is later asked what, exactly, he is a professor of.  What is Logan's reply?", "correct": "Art", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nArt.\n\n\tA funny moment, all things considered. \n"}, {"text": "In the climax of the film, a dam holding back an enormous body of water gives way, causing a devastating flood.  The dam malfunctioned due to damage caused during a pitched battle.  The fight that caused the catastrophic damage to the dam took place between which two parties?", "correct": "Cyclops and Jean Grey", "options": ["Mystique and Stryker's troops", "Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike", "Magneto and Stryker's troops"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCyclops and Jean Grey.\n\n\tCyclops, \"brainwashed\" by Stryker and his son's \"secretions\", attacks the X-Men.  Jean Grey telekinetically resists Cyclops' deadly optic blasts, but that melee causes major damage to the essential turbines and generators of the dam's internal workings.  Less than thirty minutes later, the dam ruptures. \n"}, {"text": "Near the end of the film, the X-Men pay a visit to the White House.  Xavier explains to the President of the United States that they have copies of Colonel Stryker's confidential -- and politically damaging -- anti-mutant files.  Which member of the X-Men hands a folder containing these files to the president, at Xavier's request?", "correct": "Rogue", "options": ["Cyclops", "Wolverine", "Storm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRogue.\n\n\t\"Rogue,\" Xavier says...and she drops a folder onto the president's desk.  This was a pretty cool scene -- Xavier \"psi-locked\" everyone in the room except for the president (that's all it was, by the way; Xavier by no means has the power to \"stop time\"), and Storm saw to it that an ominous thunderstorm was roiling right outside the Oval Office. \n"}, {"text": "In Xavier's final scene, he asks several of his younger students if they have ever read a particular literary classic.  Who wrote it?", "correct": "T. H. White", "options": ["Charles Dickens", "William Shakespeare", "Ernest Hemingway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nT. H. White\n\n\tThe book in question is \"The Once and Future King.\"  Magneto was seen reading this very book in his plastic cell, earlier in the film. \n"}, {"text": "Who speaks the last words heard in this film?", "correct": "Jean Grey", "options": ["Professor X", "Wolverine", "Magneto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Grey.\n\n\tJean is heard in voice-over, discussing mutation in general, as the camera glides across the lake where she apparently met her final end...or, *did* she?  (Anyone else notice that this film's ending VERY closely mimics that of \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\"...?) \n"}, {"text": "And finally, a tough one, for diehard comic book fans, to close things out.  Given the surprise tragedy at the end of the film -- and ESPECIALLY the last shot of the film -- what word is likely to be spoken many times in \"X3,\" if the obvious seeds planted in \"X2\" bear fruit in a few years?", "correct": "Phoenix", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhoenix.\n\n\tIn the comics, Jean Grey became (or \"was replaced by,\" if you buy the lame 80's \"retcon\") the virtually omnipotent entity known as the Phoenix (and later, Dark Phoenix) after experiencing inexplicable power boosts, and seemingly sacrificing herself to save her fellow X-Men.  Given the fire imagery in Jean's eyes -- and surrounding her entire body, at the end of the film -- the idea of Jean being reborn as the Phoenix is almost certainly going to be a major plot point in the next film. As further evidence, the familiar Phoenix image is almost fully visible in the lake in the last shot of the film! \n"}]}
