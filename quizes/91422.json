{"id": "91422", "name": "Oldies Meal Quiz | Something in Common | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Something in Common", "Food and Drink in Songs"], "questions": [{"text": "Meals often include \"bread and butter\". What group had a hit with that song?", "correct": "Newbeats", "options": ["Casinos", "Youngbloods", "Mel and Tim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNewbeats.\n\n\tBasically, \"Bread and Butter\" was a one-hit event for this group. The Casinos were also basically one-hit wonders with the successful \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\". Mel and Tim did what is (in my opinion) the worst song ever made: \"Backfield in Motion\". The Youngbloods did \"Get Together\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Sugar, Sugar\" could be included at any meal. Who sang that song?", "correct": "Archies", "options": ["Easybeats", "Ocean", "Jigsaw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArchies.\n\n\tTheir only big hit. The Easybeats scored nicely with \"Friday on My Mind\". Ocean had one hit, \"Put Your Hand in the Hand\". Jigsaw did \"Sky High\". \n"}, {"text": "Who had a hit when he sang that \"someone left the cake out in the rain\"?", "correct": "Richard Harris", "options": ["Kenny Rogers", "Robert Goulet", "Jack Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Harris.\n\n\t\"Macarthur Park\". Long song - and a good friend for disc jockeys everywhere. (Curious imagery, isn't it?) \n"}, {"text": "Later, a heavier meal - with \"mashed potatoes\". Who sang that song?", "correct": "Dee Dee Sharp", "options": ["Connie Francis", "Dodie Stevens", "Teresa Brewer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDee Dee Sharp.\n\n\tHer one big hit. (There was a sequel called \"Gravy\" - you're not missing much if you don't remember it.) Stevens did \"Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces\". Francis had many hits, as did Brewer. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps some \"sweet cherry wine\" with dessert. Who sang this one?", "correct": "Tommy James and the Shondells", "options": ["Jay and the Americans", "Jan and Dean", "Freddie and the Dreamers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTommy James and the Shondells.\n\n\t\"Jay\" and  his group had numerous hits. Freddie did \"I'm Telling You Now\" (which was good. \"The Freddie\" - a dance - wasn't quite as memorable.) Jan and Dean had several hits. (What do the words mean? Or is this meaningless -like \"Mony, Mony\"?) \n"}, {"text": "A good meal can be ruined when the food is burned. Who sang \"smoke gets in your eyes\"?", "correct": "Platters", "options": ["Coasters", "Drifters", "Duprees"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlatters.\n\n\tA great early group - with songs like \"Twilight Time\", \"Great Pretender\", etc. The Drifters and Duprees also had many hits in the early days of rock n roll. The Coasters are best known for \"Charlie Brown\" and \"Yakety Yak\". \n"}, {"text": "As for dessert itself, who sang about \"ice cream castles\"?", "correct": "Judy Collins", "options": ["Melanie", "Lesley Gore", "Janis Ian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJudy Collins.\n\n\t\"Both Sides Now\". The song opens with references to clouds as \"ice cream castles in the air\". Pretty song. \n"}, {"text": "What group sang that \"candy is sweet\"?", "correct": "Turtles", "options": ["Vogues", "Badfinger", "America"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTurtles.\n\n\tThe song is \"You, Baby\". (They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby ...\"). One of several hits for them. (\"Elinore\", \"Happy Together\", She'd Rather Be With Me\", etc.) The others also had a fair number of hits. \n"}, {"text": "The perfect after dinner drink is \"Brandy\". Who sang it?", "correct": "Looking Glass", "options": ["Spiral Staircase", "Grass Roots", "Peppermint Rainbow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLooking Glass.\n\n\tOne-hit territory once again. Still, a pleasant song. \"Staircase\" and \"Rainbow\" had limited success; the Grass Roots, however, had several hits. \n"}, {"text": "For the hall of fame, a toughie: who sang \"does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight\"? (It was a song - really.)", "correct": "Lonnie Donegan", "options": ["Frankie Avalon", "Tab Hunter", "Fabian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLonnie Donegan.\n\n\tTalk about bizarre lyrics to a song ... \n"}]}
