{"id": "183328", "name": "'M*A*S*H'  - 'Dear Ma' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 4 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 4"], "questions": [{"text": "As the credits roll, Radar is shown writing comfortably on his cot with a gentle night light providing ample illumination for the lad to exercise his eloquence.  In his letter, Radar makes several laughable comments.  For example, why does he claim he is writing the letter slowly? ", "correct": "Because he knows his mother can't read fast", "options": ["Because he wants to make sure he has good penmanship", "Because he wants to savor the experience of every letter", "Because he wants to provide his mother with a longer reading experience"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause he knows his mother can't read fast.\n\n\t'As usual, I am writing real slow, 'cause I know you can't read fast.' says Radar.  What a considerate young man he is, no matter how misguided he may be intellectually. \n"}, {"text": "Radar also hilariously mentions a package that he received from his mother that very morning.  Along with the cake and cookies his mother sent, what other 'delicious' item did the parcel include?", "correct": "Underwear", "options": ["Shaving cream", "Socks", "Toilet paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnderwear.\n\n\tRadar writes: 'Your package and letter arrived this morning.  The cake and cookies and the underwear were all delicious.'  I'm not sure if poor Radar understands the concept of breaking up his sentences into proper grammatical clauses.  Either that, or his mother indeed sent him edible underwear. \n"}, {"text": "In his letter, Radar discusses a recent campwide foot inspection in which he assisted Hawkeye.  The scene shifts to Colonel Potter's office, where we see Hawkeye complimenting the Colonel's fine toes.  Potter claims to have learned about foot care under whose command during World War I?", "correct": "Harry S. Truman", "options": ["Douglas MacArthur", "George C. Marshall", "Dwight Eisenhower"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry S. Truman\n\n\tHawkeye comments that the Colonel has the feet of a teenager, to which Potter responds, 'Learned about footcare during World War I from Captain Harry S. Truman, no less.  He had a great pair of feet.' Hawkeye retorts, 'Imprints of which may be seen on General MacArthur's backside.' \n"}, {"text": "Radar goes on to discuss some of the other dwellers of the 4077th, for example Klinger and BJ.  In the subsequent scene we see Klinger and BJ loading wounded soldiers onto a bus.  Just before the bus leaves for the evac hospital a certain Sergeant Callan convinces BJ to buy which of these items?", "correct": "A watch", "options": ["A camera", "A cigarette lighter", "A transistor radio"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA watch.\n\n\tJust prior to the bus leaving, Callan stops BJ, who recently had taken shrapnel out of the Sergeant's chest, and asks if BJ would be willing to buy his watch.  Callan claims that he needs the money so that he can afford an operation for his wife.  After some cajoling, he convinces BJ to purchase the watch for $20.  After the bus leaves, BJ admires his new watch, only to discover with help from Hawkeye that he has been scammed.  The watch is junk!  Later, Sergeant Callan returns with another wound...and BJ operates on him once again. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret is Hawkeye's next victim, err, patient, in the camp foot inspection.  During his investigation of Margaret's 'pretty' feet, which of these problems does Hawkeye not announce that he has discovered?", "correct": "Ingrown toenail", "options": ["Fungus", "Bunion", "Corn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIngrown toenail.\n\n\tAfter commenting on Margaret's 'pretty' foot, Hawkeye continues, 'However, a wee bit of fungus, two bunions, one corn, light on the mayo, hold the chili and onions.'  Hawkeye also suggests that Margaret's ankles are swollen, and that she may be retaining water.  He prescribes potassium permanganate for Margaret's foot fungus, and offers to spread it on to boot. \n"}, {"text": "Next we see Radar in the mess tent, eating lunch and continuing with his letter home.  He describes something strange that happened 'the other day' when he encountered a North Korean soldier in the mess tent.  How did Radar recognize that this soldier was North Korean?", "correct": "He was carrying a Russian gun", "options": ["A South Korean orderly informed Radar", "Radar saw Chinese characters on his watch", "He had the initials 'NPRK' on his uniform"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe was carrying a Russian gun.\n\n\tRadar mistakenly forgets to fill his coffee mug, and when he goes to dispense some of the awful mess java into his cup he encounters a North Korean soldier.  At first, Radar does not realize the man is North Korean and chats with him in a very friendly manner.  Only after the soldier leaves the mess tent hurriedly does Radar understand that this was an enemy soldier.  After informing Frank, the Major says, 'After shooting at our guys they've got the guts to eat our grits?' \n"}, {"text": "It's Klinger's turn to have his feet inspected and he does so quite willingly, just so long as Radar and Hawkeye listen to the letter he has written to President Eisenhower.  In his letter, Klinger suggests that he has an uncle that will provide which service for Eisenhower if Klinger is allowed out of the army?", "correct": "He will rub someone out, at a discount", "options": ["He will give Eisenhower a lifetime supply of olive oil", "He will provide Eisenhower with three camels", "He will help Eisenhower cheat on his taxes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe will rub someone out, at a discount.\n\n\tKlinger congratulates Eisenhower not only on becoming president, but also 'getting out of the army at the same time'.  Klinger continues, 'When you go through President Truman's mail, you will no doubt find some letters I wrote describing the mental condition of my mind.  I have deteriorated even more downhill since I sent him the picture of me dressed only in combat boots and a black garter belt.'  Klinger then suggests the offer from his uncle, who is 'very big in certain circles.' \n"}, {"text": "Father Mulcahy is next on Hawkeye's foot list.  While inspecting the good Father's toes, Mulcahy suggests that, with Hawkeye's gentle touch, he could have been a priest.  Why, says Hawkeye, would he have not been suited for the cloth?", "correct": "He has never been crazy about neckties", "options": ["He has always thought that black and white clothing were never too colorful", "He has never been sold on celebacy", "He believes that he would never be able to keep enough sacramental wine in storage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe has never been crazy about neckties.\n\n\tHawkeye compliments the Father's feet profusely, but notices that Mulcahy has a scar.  When asked where it came from, Mulcahy replies, 'Oh that.  My sister bit my toe.'  Hawkeye replies, 'Your sister the nun?'  'Now nun, then angry child.' the Father answers.  Hawkeye further observes, 'She has quite an overbite.'  Father Mulcahy then confides, 'Don't spread this around, but the other children called her \"beaver\".  We told her that it was because she was such a good swimmer.' \n"}, {"text": "In the episode 'Dear Ma', Colonel Potter is shot after visiting a local village with Margaret.  Where in his body has the Colonel been hit by the bullet?", "correct": "Rear end", "options": ["Shoulder", "Foot", "Calf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRear end.\n\n\tPotter was hit by a sniper while driving along the road back to the 4077th.  Strangely, Potter's wife had called earlier in the episode with a premonition that her husband had been hurt.  She calls again while the Colonel has surgery to remove the bullet from his rump.  Potter decides not to inform his wife of his condition, so as not to trouble her too much. \n"}, {"text": "Frank willingly submits to a foot inspection by the end of the episode.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tNo, he struggles all the way before being accosted and forced to reveal his feet by Hawkeye and BJ.  And for good reason...Frank's toenails have been painted red by Margaret.  Hawkeye pretends to report this 'condition' as a 'strange coloration of the toenails, possibly due to combat action with a hostile manicurist'. \n"}]}
