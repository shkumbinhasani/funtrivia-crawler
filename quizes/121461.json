{"id": "121461", "name": "Writers Turned Screenwriters Online Trivia | Directors & Writers | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Celebrity Trivia", " Movie Stars Mixed", "Directors & Writers"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Misfits\" is an original screenplay by one of America's best playwrights. Which one?", "correct": "Arthur Miller", "options": ["Eugene O'Neill", "William Inge", "Tennessee Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArthur Miller.\n\n\tIt's a curiously unsatisfying piece - but it's interesting because of the cast:  Marilyn Monroe (in her last completed movie) while her marriage to Miller was falling apart, and Clark Gable in his last film role - he died shortly after completion of the picture. \n"}, {"text": "Evan Hunter is a successful novelist; he also wrote the screenplay for a Hitchcock classic. Which one?", "correct": "The Birds", "options": ["Vertigo", "Rear Window", "Saboteur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Birds.\n\n\tHunter has written many novels as Hunter and as Ed McBain; he's also had some of his novels turned into movies. \"Birds\" was a very fine screenplay effort (from the Daphne DuMaurier short story). \n"}, {"text": "The quirky \"western\" \"Night of the Hunter\" featured a screenplay by James Agee. Who was the star of the movie?", "correct": "Robert Mitchum", "options": ["Van Heflin", "Dean Martin", "Rod Taylor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Mitchum.\n\n\tAgee, best known for \"A Death in the Family\" wrote the screenplay to this decidedly strange story. (Robert Mitchum has \"Love\" and \"Hate\" written across his fingers.) \n"}, {"text": "\"The Big Sleep\" included screenplay work by what author?", "correct": "William Faulkner", "options": ["Tom Wolfe", "Ernest Hemingway", "Robert Ludlum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Faulkner.\n\n\tPerhaps that's why the plot is so damned hard to follow. \n"}, {"text": "F. Scott Fitzgerald worked on the screenplay version of the novel, \"The Three Comrades\". Who wrote the novel?", "correct": "Erich Maria Remarque", "options": ["Leo Tolstoy", "Rudyard Kipling", "Oscar Wilde"], "explanation": "\n\n\nErich Maria Remarque.\n\n\tRemarque did more than merely write the classic \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". \n"}, {"text": "What writer worked on the screenplay version of Lillian Hellman's play \"Watch on the Rhine\"?", "correct": "Dashiell Hammett", "options": ["Gore Vidal", "Norman Mailer", "Theodore Dreiser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDashiell Hammett.\n\n\tHammett and Hellman had a long personal relationship. \n"}, {"text": "Playwright Anthony Shaffer wrote the screenplay for what Hitchcock movie?", "correct": "Frenzy", "options": ["Torn Curtain", "Strangers on a Train", "Rope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrenzy.\n\n\tShaffer wrtote the superb \"Sleuth\". This effort, however was not the best - for him or for Hitch. \n"}, {"text": "Raymond Chandler wrote the screenplay for what classic movie?", "correct": "Double Indemnity", "options": ["Out of the Past", "Sorry,  Wrong Number", "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDouble Indemnity.\n\n\tChandler wrote many tales about detective Philip Marlowe - but this wasn't one of them. (Nice job, though.) \n"}, {"text": "Harold Pinter wrote the screenplay for which of these novels by John Fowles?", "correct": "The French Lieutenant's Woman", "options": ["The Ebony Tower", "The Collector", "The Magus"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman.\n\n\tFowles is often a fascinating writer: \"The Magus\" is quite interesting and \"\"The Collector\" is also a good read. \"Lieutenant\" didn't read well (in my opinion) - and the movie (again, my opinion) was tough going. (Of course, Pinter is Pinter ...) \n"}, {"text": "A novel isn't always adapted into a screenplay by someone other than the original novelist. An example of this is \"Mildred Pierce\". Who was the author and screenwriter?", "correct": "James M. Cain", "options": ["James Gould Cozzens", "Robert Ludlum", "Irving Wallace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames M. Cain\n\n\tI haven't read the novel, but the movie was solid. \n"}]}
