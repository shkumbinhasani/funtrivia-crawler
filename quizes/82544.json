{"id": "82544", "name": "\"Somewhere in Time\": Behind the Scenes Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Somewhere in Time"], "questions": [{"text": "Richard Matheson, who wrote the novel \"Bid Time Return\" (upon which \"Somewhere in Time\" is based), got the idea for its plot after seeing a photograph of a long-deceased actress.  Who was the actress?", "correct": "Maude Adams", "options": ["Mary Pickford", "Grace Kelly", "Sarah Bernhardt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaude Adams.\n\n\tAdams was a famous American stage actress from 1892 to 1943.  She entered the spotlight thanks to her Shakespearian work, as well as her 1500 performances of J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan\" in 1905-1907, 1913, and 1918.  Here's a clip from her bio: \"She had always kept her private life from public view, and she lived quietly in retirement until her death in Tannersville, New York, on July 17, 1953.\"  Sound familiar? \n"}, {"text": "Matheson realized that he had found the setting for his novel after staying at a particular hotel.  It was not, however, the Grand Hotel in Mackinac Island, Michigan (where most of the movie takes place).  In what state did Matheson set his novel?", "correct": "California", "options": ["New York", "Illinois", "Florida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalifornia.\n\n\tMatheson stayed at the luxurious Coronado Hotel in San Diego, California.  That location was briefly considered as the setting of the movie, but director Jeannot Swarc was uncomfortable with revisiting the site of the 1959 Billy Wilder classic \"Some Like It Hot\". \n"}, {"text": "Director Jeannot Swarc notes that one of the reasons that he decided to cast Jane Seymour was the fact that she answered \"no\" to a certain question.  What was the question?", "correct": "\"Have you ever been in love?\"", "options": ["\"Do you believe that time travel is possible?\"", "\"Have you seen 'Superman: the Movie'?\"", "\"Are you willing to do a nude scene?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Have you ever been in love?\".\n\n\tApparently, of the dozens of actresses who auditioned for the part of Elise McKenna, Seymour was the only one who said \"no\" when asked that question.  Swarc states that that answer probably played a part in her being cast in the role. \n"}, {"text": "Christopher Reeve had a rather unusual item hidden away on Mackinac Island during the shoot.  What was it?", "correct": "an airplane", "options": ["a full-sized \"Space Invaders\" arcade game", "a Porsche 944", "a Superman costume"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan airplane.\n\n\tReeve, who was an avid pilot at the time, had a small plane stashed at the local airport.  He and Jane Seymour would, on occasion, sneak away from the location in the middle of the night and take impromptu flights -- he even taught Seymour how to fly on one of their jaunts.  Furthermore, when Reeve learned that Teresa Wright (who played Laura Roberts) was nervous about possibly missing a rehearsal for a Broadway play in which she was imminently set to appear, he assured her that if her \"Somewhere in Time\" scenes ran longer than the schedule suggested, he would personally fly her to New York to make sure that she would be on time. \n"}, {"text": "When Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) first sees the photograph of Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History, actor Christopher Reeve is seeing the photo for the first time, as well.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDirector Jeannot Swarc makes it quite clear that Reeve insisted that the photo be obscured from his view until the first time that Richard Collier was to first see the photograph, in order to help him truly experience the image for the first time.  Swarc was then forced to cover the photo with sheets and tarpaulins for weeks whenever Reeve was near it. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most moving scenes in the film takes place when Elise McKenna abandons the script of the play she is starring in for the purpose of delivering a monologue declaring her love for Richard Collier, at whom she stares directly throughout this sequence.  When this scene was shot, at whom was Seymour looking?", "correct": "Richard Matheson", "options": ["Christopher Reeve", "No one", "Jeannot Swarc"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Matheson.\n\n\tThe first time the scene was shot, Seymour had the privilege of looking directly at Reeve.  Unfortunately, there was a technical problem with the take, and Seymour was forced to perform the scene again, well after Reeve had left the production.  During the take that was used in the final film, Seymour was staring directly at author Richard Matheson -- and he was the only person sitting in the theater. \n"}, {"text": "Christopher Reeve was rather distracted during the shooting of a critical sequence because he had just learned, via telephone, that his spouse was pregnant.  In what sequence was Reeve, by his own admission, noticeably distracted?", "correct": "the \"picnic\" scene in Elise's hotel room", "options": ["the scene in which Richard cuts his own hair and talks to his reflection", "the rowboat sequence, in which Elise learns that Richard loves Rachmaninoff", "the scene in which Richard meets (old) Arthur for the first time at the Grand Hotel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe \"picnic\" scene in Elise's hotel room.\n\n\tReeve states that he felt that he was extremely distracted that day, and that Jane Seymour really \"made\" the scene, as his mind was elsewhere.  Personally, I thought that his performance was excellent in every scene. \n"}, {"text": "When the time came for the film to be scored, veteran composer John Barry's name was mentioned, but director Jeannot Swarc, well aware of the fact that the budget of the film was only four million dollars, insisted that he would not be able to afford Barry's services.  Whose personal friendship with Barry assured that he would score the film for a fraction of his usual fee?", "correct": "Jane Seymour", "options": ["Christopher Reeve", "Christopher Plummer", "Teresa Wright"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane Seymour.\n\n\tSeymour's friendship with John Barry -- the origin of which she has not revealed -- made it simple for her to procure Barry's services as composer with a single phone call, despite the minimal fee he would receive.  My original thought was that Barry had scored \"Live and Let Die,\" in which Seymour co-starred...but I was wrong.  Barry scored a number of 'James Bond' films, but George Martin actually scored \"Live and Let Die\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the acronym of the official \"Somewhere in Time\" fan club (or, as its founder prefers to call it, \"appreciation society\")?", "correct": "INSITE", "options": ["COOLSIT", "SITDOWN", "SITRUS"], "explanation": "\n\n\nINSITE.\n\n\tThe fan club's official name is \"the International Network of 'Somewhere in Time' Enthusiasts\"...or INSITE, for short. \n"}, {"text": "Somewhere on Mackinac Island, there is an elaborate plaque commemorating the fact that \"Somewhere in Time\" was filmed there.  Where can one find this plaque?", "correct": "on the island's shoreline, where Elise and Richard first met", "options": ["in the room where Richard first \"arrived\" in 1912", "in Elise's room, where Elise and Richard first kissed, and consummated their relationship", "on the stage of the theater where Elise first told Richard that she loved him"], "explanation": "\n\n\non the island's shoreline, where Elise and Richard first met.\n\n\tThe plaque is mounted on what appears to be a large chunk of granite.  It sits exactly where Elise first looked Richard in the eye and asked, \"Is it you?\" \n"}]}
