{"id": "220815", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Our Finest Hour' (Part 2) Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 7"], "questions": [{"text": "Clete Roberts, a member of the press, has been dispatched to Korea to interview the dwellers of the 4077th.  He asks the question, 'What do you do to relax?'  Hawkeye responds that he collapses.  He adds that he engages in which activity to 'stay in shape'?", "correct": "Drinking", "options": ["Playing cards", "Sleeping", "Eating K-rations"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrinking.\n\n\tHawkeye's acerbic wit comes through sharply in his interview responses.  His response that he drinks to stay in shape could be a reference to the extensive efforts he uses to stir his martinis. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 4077th crew says that his main vehicle for relaxation is the playing of poker?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Klinger", "Colonel Potter", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy's response seems rather ironic, since gambling could be construed as a sin.  However, the good Father adds that all (or *almost* all) of his winnings go to the orphans.  His euphemism for winning in poker is 'shearing of the flock'. \n"}, {"text": "How does Charles Emerson Winchester III find solace and relaxation at the 4077th?", "correct": "Listening to classical music", "options": ["Playing practical jokes on his tentmates", "Reading letters from home", "Performing surgery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nListening to classical music.\n\n\tAs is depicted in literally dozens of occasions, Charles finds a great deal of pleasure in listening to classical music, especially Mozart.  He has his own record player in the Swamp, sometimes much to the displeasure of Hawkeye and BJ. \n"}, {"text": "A series of snippets from past episodes are shown that display Maxwell Q. Klinger at his best (or worst, depending on your perspective).  Which character claims that, despite Klinger's shenanigans, he is the sanest individual at the 4077th?", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Father Mulcahy", "Colonel Potter", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tBJ's precise quote: 'He's the only sane one here, it's the rest of us who are crazy!' \n"}, {"text": "When asked how the war has changed each individual, which character claims that the war has made him 'very, very angry'?", "correct": "BJ", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Charles", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBJ.\n\n\tBJ shows his great displeasure at being in Korea during a number of episodes.  Regardless of the fact that he has made great friends at the 4077th, he can never forgive the notion that he has been taken away from his wife and baby girl. \n"}, {"text": "When Margaret is asked how the war has changed her, which of these adjectives comes immediately to her mind?", "correct": "Old", "options": ["Sad", "Fulfilled", "Crazy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOld.\n\n\tMargaret suggests that the war has made her older, older indeed than she had ever imagined.  Ironically, Colonel Potter claims the opposite, that the war has reinvigorated him and made him feel ten years younger. \n"}, {"text": "When asked what he will remember most about Korea, what is Charles' response?", "correct": "He will have no memories of Korea", "options": ["He will never forget the life lessons he has learned in Korea", "He will remember only the day he leaves", "He will never forget how he was forced to come to the 4077th"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe will have no memories of Korea.\n\n\tCharles claims that he will have no memories of Korea and that he 'blots it out as it happens'.

His generosity is sometimes overlooked during the series, as the doctors and nurses tend to get most of the focus. \n"}, {"text": "According to his commentary in this episode, which specific day in Korea will Radar remember above all others?", "correct": "The day that Henry blake was killed", "options": ["The day he arrived at the 4077th", "The day he was injured and had a confrontation with Hawkeye", "The day his Uncle Ed died"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe day that Henry blake was killed.\n\n\tOf course, Radar's Uncle Ed had not died by the airing of this episode, so perhaps that day might also live on in his memory.  However, in this episode, he claims that the single most memorable moment for him in Korea was that horrible day when he announced Henry Blake's death in the OR. \n"}, {"text": "Towards the end of the episode, which character tells the moving story about how, in the middle of winter, he has witnessed doctors warming their hands over the open wounds of patients?", "correct": "Father Mulcahy", "options": ["Klinger", "Radar", "Colonel Potter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather Mulcahy.\n\n\tFather Mulcahy's moments in this episode are the most heart-rending.  He talks about how one can actually see steam rising from the wounds of soldiers that are being treated in the OR.  This is one of the memories that will stay with him forever.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
