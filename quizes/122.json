The German Johann Galle found Neptune in 1846, the second planet (after Uranus) to be discovered using a telescope. Urbain Le Verrier and, it is claimed, John Couch Adams, had separately calculated its likely position. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the largest moon in our solar system?", "correct": "Ganymede", "options": ["Triton", "Titan", "Earths moon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGanymede.\n\n\tGanymede is the largest moon in our solar system, with a diameter of 3,274 miles (5,269 kilometers).

The comet had just been discovered and named the year before by two astronomers named, go figure, Shoemaker and Levy! \n"}, {"text": "The Giotto space probe was launched in order to examine what type of space object?", "correct": "Comet", "options": ["Asteroid", "Solar Flare", "Meteorite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComet.\n\n\tThe Giotto sent back the first pictures of a comet's nucleus, in 1986.

What is the third brightest star in apparent magnitude (after the Sun and Sirius)?", "correct": "Canopus", "options": ["Vega", "Alpha Centauri", "Betelgeuse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanopus.\n\n\tSirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.6, Canopus -0.9, Alpha Centauri +0.1, Vega +0.1, and Betelgeuse +0.9. The negative values indicate that those stars are VERY bright, as seen from Earth. As can be imagined, the sun has a very high negative number...please don't attempt to observe it with your naked eye, or even with sunglasses on! \n"}, {"text": "Which planet has the largest volcano and largest valley in the solar system?", "correct": "Mars", "options": ["Venus", "Earth", "Jupiter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMars.\n\n\tThe largest volcano in the solar system is called Olympus Mons.
