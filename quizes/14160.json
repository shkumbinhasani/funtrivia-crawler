One method, which didn't work on overcast days or at night, was the sundial. On what other factor was operation of a sundial dependent?", "correct": "latitude", "options": ["knowledge of calculus", "longitude", "altitude"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlatitude.\n\n\tLatitude -- the north-south position of a place on the globe -- is important because sunlight strikes the earth at different angles at different latitudes. Hence, the spacing between hours on a sundial must vary according to latitude, and a Boston sundial will not work in Miami. \r Nowadays, the relationship between the position of the sun and the time on the clock does depend on longitude as well, but this is only because time zones (introduced in the 19th century) have done away with the concept of true local time. It used to be that noon was always defined as the time when the sun was at its zenith, wherever you were, but markings on modern sundials have to take into account a location's east-west position within its time zone. \n"}, {"text": "We have 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. To what ancient people do we owe this system based on the number 60?", "correct": "The Babylonians", "options": ["The Romans", "The Chinese", "The Greeks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Babylonians.\n\n\tAfter their 1789 Revolution, at the same time they changed the names of all the months, the French revolutionaries experimented with a decimal system of time (two cycles of 10 hours a day). The people hated it. \n"}, {"text": "In the middle ages, mechanical clocks with gears and pulleys began to be built. One such clock, dating from the 13th century, is thought to be the oldest mechanical clock still in working order. In what English cathedral is it located?", "correct": "Salisbury Cathedral", "options": ["York Minster", "Canterbury Cathedral", "St Paul's Cathedral"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalisbury Cathedral.\n\n\tThis clock was originally located in the belfry -- one of its gears was connected to a rope, which would ring the bells every hour. When Cromwell's troops damaged the belfry in the 1640s, the clock was moved to the cathedral, where it is no longer kept wound. \n"}, {"text": "Mechanical timekeeping took a great leap forward in 1656, when what inventor built the first pendulum clock?", "correct": "Christiaan Huygens", "options": ["John Harrison", "Galileo Galilei", "Foucault"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristiaan Huygens.\n\n\tAlthough Galileo DESIGNED a pendulum clock, he never built one. Huygens's clock lost only one minute every day; later, more refined versions lost only 10 seconds. In fact, pendulum clocks remained the most accurate clocks until the advent of the quartz oscillator in the 1930s. \n"}, {"text": "The 'celestial clock' -- the telling of time from the apparent movements of the stars -- is based on the motion of what heavenly body against a background ('reference frame') of fixed stars?", "correct": "the moon", "options": ["Venus", "the sun", "Polaris"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe moon.\n\n\tAlthough the celestial standard is no longer used for time -- that is, a year is no longer defined as the amount of time it takes Earth to orbit the sun -- 'celestial clock', or sidereal time, is still very important for astronomers. \n"}, {"text": "As the 17th century ended, the need for an accurate seagoing clock became paramount, as empires expanded across the oceans. Without a clock, there was no way to determine longitude, or east-west position, and many ships were lost as a result. Why couldn't the new pendulum clocks be used?", "correct": "The rocking of the ship would change the oscillation of the pendulum", "options": ["The salvage industry sabotaged all attempts", "Uneducated sailors might attack them as tools of the devil", "No reason; it's just that no one thought of it"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe rocking of the ship would change the oscillation of the pendulum.\n\n\tWhen a ship rocks back and forth, it causes the pendulum's swings to speed up or slow down -- you can try it by tying a weight to a string, swinging it from your hand, and then seeing what it does when you tilt your hand back and forth. Here's how a clock would help longitude: if you know local time (from the position of the sun), and you know the time somewhere else, you can calculate your distance east or west from the difference in those times. \n"}, {"text": "The British government was particularly anxious to have the longitude problem solved, and offered a huge prize (20,000 pounds) to anyone who could produce a seagoing clock. Meanwhile, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich continued work on the 'celestial clock'. John Flamsteed began by compiling a reference frame of stars; what famous scientist, succeeding Flamsteed as Astronomer Royal, continued the work by charting the foreground motions of a body in the solar system?", "correct": "Edmund Halley", "options": ["Isaac Newton", "Johannes Kepler", "Leonhard Euler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdmund Halley.\n\n\tHalley reasoned that with Flamsteed's catalog of stars and a predictive chart of the motions of the moon, sailors could (with some complicated math) calculate their longitude accurately. By this method, they could; the problem was the difficulty of the math, and the frequent and deadly mistakes in calculations . . . \n"}, {"text": "In the 1720s, a self-taught English clockmaker thought he had found a solution to the longitude problem. What was his name?", "correct": "John Harrison", "options": ["James Harrison", "Arnold Rigby", "Christopher Pelham"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Harrison.\n\n\tAnd he had found a solution! It did, however, require some tweaking . . . and some research loans from scientists of the day. \n"}, {"text": "His first model, the H1, used wooden gears instead of metal ones, so that it wouldn't need to be messily lubricated, and it replaced a pendulum with what other mechanism?", "correct": "linked balances, driven by springs", "options": ["electric quartz oscillator", "telescope", "spring-loaded lever-and-fulcrum assembly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlinked balances, driven by springs.\n\n\tLubrication at that time required animal oil, which got sticky after a few months so that the clocks would have to be taken apart, cleaned and reassembled -- and by that point, much time has been lost. The H1 performed well enough for second prize on a test voyage to Lisbon -- but Harrison, a perfectionist, began work on a second clock. \n"}, {"text": "His third model, H3, included two innovations frequently used in modern machinery: the caged roller bearing (precursor to our ball bearings) for less friction, and the bimetallic strip to deal with what other problem?", "correct": "temperature changes", "options": ["prediction of storms", "sailors asking too many questions", "the need for winding clocks"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntemperature changes.\n\n\tChanges in temperature cause metals to expand or contract. For his clock, where the size of the metal piece is crucial to keeping a uniform time unit, Harrison welded two different metals together. They expand and contract at different rates, and so compensate for each other. Very important, when on a single voyage a ship might travel both to the arctic and to the tropics! \n"}, {"text": "Not even the H3 was reliable enough as a clock for seafarers. In 1761, the master clockmaker's son put his fourth and final model, H4, to the test. It was inspired by what newly-emerging timekeeper, subject of much contemporary ridicule?", "correct": "the pocketwatch", "options": ["the double-pendulum", "the alarm clock", "the mechanical hourglass"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe pocketwatch.\n\n\tHarrison realized that in order to compensate for shipboard wobbles, his clock had to have a large number of ticks per minute -- the shorter the interval it measured, the less it would be affected by wobbles. H4, only 6 in. (13 cm) in diameter, looks just like an overgrown pocketwatch. It performed 3 times better than necessary to win the prize -- but they refused to award it until the clock's success could be duplicated. \n"}, {"text": "While the H4 seafaring clock succeeded in the task assigned it by the Longitude Commission, its mettle was proved when a copy (K1) accompanied what famous explorer on a three-year voyage, never losing more than 8 seconds per day?", "correct": "Captain Cook", "options": ["Martin Frobisher", "John Cabot", "Francis Drake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCaptain Cook.\n\n\tCook referred to the clock as 'our Friend, the Watch', but his enthusiasm was proven mainly by the fact that he kept the experimental clock for use on his third and final voyage. \n"}, {"text": "The next major advance in timekeeping occurred in the 1930s, with the quartz crystal oscillator -- a device used by just about everyone who owns a wristwatch. The quartz crystal as a timepiece is based on a combination of piezoelectricity and what principle?", "correct": "resonance", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nresonance.\n\n\tResonance occurs when an object is continually struck at the frequency of its natural vibrations; it then vibrates indefinitely at that frequency. A piezoelectric current allows us to 'strike' the quartz crystal indefinitely, providing vibrations at a constant and measurable frequency. \n"}, {"text": "As both astronomy and timekeeping grew more advanced, it was discovered that the earth does not rotate at a constant rate. It was then decided to move to an atomic standard, where one second is defined as 9,192,631,770 transitions of what element?", "correct": "cesium", "options": ["hydrogen", "uranium", "plutonium"], "explanation": "\n\n\ncesium.\n\n\tTo be precise, it's 9,192,631,770 transitions of cesium-133. A transition is a cycle of change between two states (ground and excited); it is most detectable in radioactive elements such as cesium. \n"}, {"text": "Standard cesium clocks are very accurate over longish time-scales, but they can lose accuracy when it gets down into micro- and nanoseconds (one-millionth and one-billionth, respectively). What other kind of atomic clock measures time over the short term?", "correct": "hydrogen maser", "options": ["cesium fountain", "hydrogen fountain", "cesium maser"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhydrogen maser.\n\n\tThus, time is determined from a combination of measurements, using both cesium clocks and hydrogen masers. \n"}, {"text": "The next wave of atomic clocks is the cesium fountain, which involves rapid temperature changes. One of the target temperatures is within a few billionths of a degree of what famous temperature constant?", "correct": "absolute zero", "options": ["freezing point of water (at sea level)", "boiling point of water (at sea level)", "critical point of nitrogen gas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nabsolute zero.\n\n\tSeveral physicists shared a Nobel prize for the method of getting the temperature that low, by the way. \n"}, {"text": "What relatively new technology makes it so important to have accurate timekeeping over such tiny intervals?", "correct": "Global Positioning System", "options": ["International Space Station", "Ocular implants (for the blind)", "Manned Space Missions (e.g. to Mars)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGlobal Positioning System.\n\n\tThe Global Positioning System (GPS) can currently fix your position to within a few meters, and timekeeping is central to GPS! The system works through triangulation: if you know your distance relative to two satellites, and you know where the satellites are, then you can tell where you are. (Actually, GPS usually uses four satellites, for redundancy and to account for the curved surface of the Earth.)\r But how do you know how far away from the satellites you are? The answer is through timing. Each satellite has an atomic clock on board. It sends a signal to your GPS receiver along with the time the message was transmitted. Your receiver calculates how long it took the signal to reach it, and then calculates the distance from the elapsed time. The uncertainty in the position thus depends on the uncertainty in the timing.\r Now suppose you want to land a plane on a rocking, pitching aircraft carrier with no lights, in the dead of night, under battle conditions? Wouldn't you want your position to be VERY accurate? To get those last few feet requires that the only errors in time measurement be truly tiny. \n"}, {"text": "What institution is responsible for measuring and distributing correct time in the United States?", "correct": "U.S. Naval Observatory", "options": ["U.S. Branch, International Time Commission", "U.S. Clockmakers' Local 208", "U.S. Department of Commerce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nU.S. Naval Observatory\n\n\tThe Naval Observatory, with sites in Colorado and Flagstaff, Arizona, in addition to its headquarters in Washington, DC, has held this responsibility for over a hundred years. \n"}, {"text": "On the light side: what surrealist painter created a famous painting featuring melting clocks and watches?", "correct": "Salvador Dali & Dali", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalvador Dali & Dali.\n\n\tIt's a quality painting. \n"}, {"text": "In closing: the world's atomic clocks never had a problem with the Y2K bug, since on the whole they measure long timescales not in years, but using what kind of daily measurement?", "correct": "Modified Julian Day", "options": ["Julian Day", "Modified Gregorian Day", "Gregorian Day"], "explanation": "\n\n\nModified Julian Day.\n\n\tThe Julian Day gives the number of days that have passed since noon (Greenwich Time) on 1 January, 4713 BC. The Modified Julian Day subtracts 2,400,000.5, which starts each day at midnight (not noon; this way it conforms with civil time) and reduces the number to a more manageable 5 digits. \n"}]}
