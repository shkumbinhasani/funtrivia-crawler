{"id": "362629", "name": "Brave New Word Online Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "Languages"], "questions": [{"text": "You're in the Philippines in the foothills of Mount Pinatubo. In the local language, which of the following do you require to shield your eyes from the glaring sun?", "correct": "Salaming pang-araw", "options": ["Palaka", "Isda", "Chutzpah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalaming pang-araw.\n\n\t\"Salaming pang-araw\" is the Filipino phrase meaning \"sunglasses\". The other two Filipino words here would be less useful; \"isda\" translates as \"fish\", while \"palaka\" means \"frog\". \"Chutzpah\" is a Yiddish word meaning \"audacity\" that has been adopted by the English language and derives from the Hebrew \"hutspa\". \n"}, {"text": "You've just landed in Helsinki, and need some way to get to your hotel. Which of these is the least likely option?", "correct": "Norsu", "options": ["Juna", "Taksi", "Raitiovaunu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorsu.\n\n\tHelsinki is Finland's capital, and so you'll need to break out your Finnish phrasebook! Three of these options would be sensible choices in order to travel from an airport to a hotel: \"taksi\" is just what it sounds like, a \"taxi\"; \"juna\" is a train; and \"raitiovaunu\" is a tram. You'd be highly unlikely to even see a \"norsu\" in a Finnish street, never mind ride one to your hotel, as it's an elephant! Other modes of transport in Finland include \"polkupy\u00f6r\u00e4\" (\"bicycle\"), \"auto\" (\"car\"), and \"lentokone\" (\"airplane\"). \n"}, {"text": "Next you find yourself checking in at a Parisian hotel and you decide on a quick snack from room service. From the options listed, which one do you need to ask for?", "correct": "Service de chambre", "options": ["Femme de chambre", "Blanchisseries", "Serviettes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nService de chambre.\n\n\t\"Service de chambre\" will, hopefully, get you a nice bacon sandwich. \"Blanchisseries\" will get your laundry done, while \"femme de chambre\" will summon a chambermaid. \"Serviettes\" will bring forth nice clean fluffy towels. \n"}, {"text": "Uh oh! You've had an accident while in Tokyo! Luckily, it's not too serious, but it's best to be on the safe side. Which of these do you definitely NOT want to get a hold of?", "correct": "Sasori", "options": ["Okyu shochi kitto", "Isha", "Kyukyusha"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSasori.\n\n\tWhile the others would be helpful, I can't think why any injured person would need a \"sasori\", which is a scorpion! Hopefully, the \"kyukyusha\" (\"ambulance\") will have an \"okyu shochi kitto\" (\"first aid kit\") on board, and you'll only need to see the \"isha\" (\"doctor\") as a precaution. Other things that may be needed after an accident are \"keisatsu\" (\"police\"), \"kankoshi\" (\"nurse\"), or a \"bandoeido\" (\"band aid\"). \n"}, {"text": "Stepping off the train in Rome you need a porter to carry your luggage to the taxi. What do you need to ask for?", "correct": "Ferrovia porter", "options": ["Macchnista", "Bagno caldo", "Noleggio auto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerrovia porter.\n\n\tHopefully a suitable tip will persuade a porter to carry your bags. If you asked for a \"macchinista\" you would get the train driver, who almost certainly would not carry bags for you. \"Noleggio auto\" gets you a hire car, and you definitely don't want a \"bagno caldo\" on a railway station, although you might like a hot bath when you reach the hotel. \n"}, {"text": "You're off on safari to Nairobi! It's the trip of a lifetime, and you have a checklist of animals that you want to catch sight of while you're there. Which of these is top of the list?", "correct": "Chui", "options": ["Duka", "Siki", "Suruali"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChui.\n\n\tAs you're in Nairobi, Kenya, the language you're speaking is Swahili. \"Chui\" is the only live one here; it is a leopard. You'll likely come across the others at some point, as \"duka\" means \"shop\", \"siki\" is \"vinegar\", and \"suruali\" are trousers, but I'm sure these are not on your animals checklist! Other animals to keep an eye out for are \"pundumilia\" (\"zebra\"), \"nyumbu\" (\"wildebeest\"), and of course \"simba\" (\"lion\"). \n"}, {"text": "You're off to visit the largest country in the world, Russia. Which of these would be of most value to you on your trip?", "correct": "Putevoditel'", "options": ["Zanaves", "Banan", "Krysa"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPutevoditel'.\n\n\tA \"putevoditel'\" is a guidebook, and you'll need a very large one in order to see everything there is to see in Russia! Although a \"banan\" (\"banana\") would be nice, I'm sure it would be considerably less useful than the guidebook! A \"zanaves\" is a curtain, while a \"krysa\" is just about the least useful thing I can think of for a holiday - it's a rat! Other holiday must-haves are a \"kamera\" (\"camera\"), \"den'gi\" (\"money\"), and very likely a warm \"pal'to\" (\"coat\") and \"shlyapa\" (\"hat\")! \n"}, {"text": "You want to do some sightseeing in South Africa's Northern Cape but you don't know how to get around. Which of these items do you need to purchase before you get going?", "correct": "Kaart", "options": ["Stoel", "Engel", "Verkoeler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaart.\n\n\tAs you are in the Northern Cape of South Africa the most spoken language is Afrikaans. \"Kaart\" simply translates as a map, much more helpful for making your way around than an \"engel\" (\"angel\"), \"verkoeler\" (\"radiator\") or \"stoel\" (\"chair\"). That being said, if you could get someone to carry your chair then you'd get around no problem! \n"}, {"text": "You've travelled to Rio de Janeiro to catch some rays on the glorious beaches. Which of the following would NOT be part of a nice relaxed day at the beach?", "correct": "Tubar\u00e3o", "options": ["Sorvete", "Espregui\u00e7adeira", "Castelo de areia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTubar\u00e3o.\n\n\tAs you are in Brazil, the primary language spoken is Portuguese. Three of the options could all be part of a fun day at the beach, they are \"espregui\u00e7adeira\" (\"deckchair\"), \"castelo de areia\" (\"sand castle\") and \"sorvete\" (\"ice cream\"). However, if your day at the beach involved a visit from a \"tubar\u00e3o\" (\"shark\") then you might be a little less laid back. \n"}, {"text": "Your travels in Warsaw are coming to an end, and you want to cook a goodbye meal for the kind Poles who have befriended you and guided you through their city. Which of these should you avoid serving for the meal?", "correct": "Paznokiec", "options": ["Chleb", "Kielbasa", "Piwo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaznokiec.\n\n\tI know that everyone likes different things, but I'm not sure there are many people who'd appreciate being served a \"paznokiec\", which is a toenail! Yuk! The other options are considerably more palatable: \"kielbasa\" is a \"sausage\", \"piwo\" is \"beer\", while \"chleb\" is \"bread\". You could also try some \"zupa\" (\"soup\"), \"wino\" (\"wine\"), or go for the healthier options of \"salatka\" (\"salad\") and some \"owoc\" (\"fruit\"). \n"}]}
