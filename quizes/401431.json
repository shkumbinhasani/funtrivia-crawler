{"id": "401431", "name": "Hardest Stargate: Continuum Trivia Quiz | Stargate Universe | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stargate Universe"], "questions": [{"text": "Which former SG-1 member had went ahead of the team to help with a prisoner transport in the beginning of the movie? ", "correct": "Jack O'Neill", "options": ["Jonas Quinn", "Teal'C", "Daniel Jackson "], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack O'Neill.\n\n\tJack O'Neill (played by Richard Dean Anderson) had left the team officially after season 7 of the series when he was promoted to general. He left the series other than in small guest appearances after season 8 entirely. He returned for a small appearance in the movie, and in the opening scene had already gone ahead with SG-3 to transport a prisoner for the Goa'uld extraction ceremony. Jack was killed when the prisoner (who was a clone) attacked during the extraction ceremony. Teal'c and Vala disappeared, but Daniel, Cameron Mitchell, and Samatha Carter escaped back to Earth. \n"}, {"text": "Which Goa'uld leader was being officially extracted from a host at the beginning of the movie?", "correct": "Ba'al", "options": ["Ra", "Hathor", "Apophis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBa'al.\n\n\tMost of the Goa'uld were named after gods of Egyptian mythology in the continuity of the \"Stargate\" Universe. Ba'al had featured in in the last five seasons of the show, and was the last known surviving system lord at the time of this movie. He was played by Cliff Simon in all of his appearances. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the ship that the Stargate was on when the remaining members of SG-1 returned to Earth? ", "correct": "Achilles", "options": ["Rubber Foot", "Ozymandias", "Smithsonian"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAchilles.\n\n\tThe Achilles was the ship that had originally brought the Stargate from Africa to America when it was discovered. Thanks to a time-traveling Ba'al (the original, not the clone) the gate never made it to America, and the Stargate program was never started. The three SG-1 members were rescued by a team that included Col. Jack O'Neill (who had not yet been promoted to General in this timeline.) \n"}, {"text": "Which SG-1 member never existed in the alternate timeline?", "correct": "Cameron Mitchell", "options": ["Daniel Jackson", "Samantha Carter", "Teal'C"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCameron Mitchell.\n\n\tCameron Mitchell's (Ben Browder) grandfather was the captain of the Achilles (what a convenient plot device...). When Ba'al went back in time he killed the crew of the ship, making it so that Mitchell and his father were both never born.  \r Samantha Carter was an astronaut in the alternate timeline, Daniel Jackson was a discredited scientist, and Teal'C wasn't known since he was an alien and the Stargate program didn't exist on Earth. Teal'C was however known to Ba'al, who was working for him instead of Aphopis like he had in the original timeline. \n"}, {"text": "How long were the three displaced SG-1 members in the new timeline before the Air Force called them back to service? ", "correct": "About a year", "options": ["About 6 months", "About 3 weeks", "About 12 hours"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbout a year.\n\n\tThe Air Force separated them and forced them to live lives with no contact with each other. Other than that they were forced into civilian lives. About a year after they arrived in the new timeline, Goa'uld ships appeared on Earth and they were called into service to help. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the U.S. president in the new timeline?", "correct": "Henry Hayes", "options": ["George Hammond", "Ba'al", "Vala Mal Doran"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry Hayes.\n\n\tHenry Hayes (played by William Devane) was the president from season 7 to the end of \"Stargate: SG-1\" the series. In the alternate timeline of the movie, he was still the president. It was at his order that SG-1's remaining members were called in to help against the Goa'uld in the alternate timeline. \n"}, {"text": "Vala Mal Doran, in the alternate timeline, was hosting which Goa'uld symbiote? ", "correct": "Qetesh", "options": ["Klorel", "Ra", "Qetesh ", "Amonet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nQetesh.\n\n\tVala (played by Claudia Black) was a former Goa'uld host in the main timeline of the TV series. In the alternate timeline of the movie, she was never separated from the Goa'uld and was still hosting Qetesh. Qetesh, in that timeline, was Ba'al's second in command and lover. \n"}, {"text": "How many Stargates were on Earth?", "correct": "2", "options": ["0", "3", "1"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2.\n\n\tThough they hadn't started a Stargate program after losing the gate that was on the Achilles, Earth actually had two gates. SG-1 had told them of the second gate that was buried in Antarctica, which was there in this timeline as well. The Goa'uld destroyed that gate, but the original gate from the Achilles ship was recovered by the Russian government and used to help the team with their mission. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the only SG-1 member to survive the attack of the Goa'uld and try to fix the timeline?  ", "correct": "Cameron", "options": ["Vala", "Daniel", "Teal'C"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCameron.\n\n\tSam and Daniel were killed in a fight, and Teal'C was mortally wounded, eventually killing himself to protect Mitchell from Qetesh. Cameron traveled back through time, but 10 years farther than intended, to stop Ba'al from changing the timeline. He was successful after hiding on the Achilles for 10 years. \n"}, {"text": "Did any of the SG-1 members in the restored timeline remember what happened in the alternate timeline? ", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tThough, the photo in Cam's locker changed from a picture of his grandfather to a picture of himself (the one that was 10 years older though) and his grandfather. Daniel Jackson wondered what the Ba'al clone had meant when he said they had all made a terrible mistake, but that was the only thing they said about the extraction ceremony.\r The movie, at the time it was filmed, held the record for the movie filmed farther North on Earth than any other in history, as it included several scenes filmed at the U.S. Navy's Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station in the Arctic. It was placed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the accomplishment. \n"}]}
