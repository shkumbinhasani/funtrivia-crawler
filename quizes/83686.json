{"id": "83686", "name": "Doomsday Trivia Quiz | Classic Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Classic Movies", "Classics - Average 10"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Bedford Incident\" is a nice, taut suspense movie about a nuclear cat-and-mouse game at sea. Which of the following is NOT in the cast?", "correct": "Anthony Perkins", "options": ["Sidney Poitier", "Richard Widmark", "Martin Balsam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnthony Perkins.\n\n\tWidmark is the commander who keeps everyone up tight. Balsam and Poitier are also on board. There are many nervous sailors on the ship - but Perkins isn't one of them. Good movie. \n"}, {"text": "\"On the Beach\" involves the end of the world (as a result of nuclear fallout). (Gregory Peck stars as a submarine commander.) Where are the last survivors?  ", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["Alaska", "Antarctica", "Greenland"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tThey're waiting for the inevitable end. A bit slow-moving ... and definitely depressing. With Ava Gardner. Based on a novel by Neville Shute. \n"}, {"text": "\"Dr. Strangelove\" was a black comic look at the problem of nuclear weapons. Who ends up \"riding\" the bomb?", "correct": "Slim Pickens", "options": ["Bruce Dern", "Chill Wills", "L.Q. Jones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlim Pickens.\n\n\tAll of the four are character actors, but it was Pickens who took the wild ride. One of Stanley Kubrick's movies. With Peter Sellers (in a variety of roles). \n"}, {"text": "\"Fail Safe\" was a very well-done suspense movie about Cold War nuclear tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The solution offered by the President (Henry Fonda) involved the destruction of what U.S. city?", "correct": "New York", "options": ["Washington D.C.", "Los Angeles", "Boston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York.\n\n\tWith Walter Matthau (in a serious role), Larry Hagman (long before \"Dallas\") and Fritz Weaver.

What caused the devastation of mankind?", "correct": "War", "options": ["Overpopulation", "Famine", "Plague"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWar.\n\n\tWar is usually the culprit in these movies. Some went underground; some took their chances above - hence, the division into Morlock and Eloi. Easy viewing. With (of all people) Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Planet of the Apes\", Charlton Heston discovers that he has been visiting Earth's future. What wreckage does he discover that leads him to this realization?", "correct": "The Statue of Liberty", "options": ["The Eiffel Tower", "The Sphinx", "The White House"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Statue of Liberty.\n\n\tNo, it's not another planet - it's Earth-of-the-future.

It drags - big time. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" featured a visitor from another planet with a warning for Earth. Who played the visitor?", "correct": "Michael Rennie", "options": ["Leslie Nielsen", "Joseph Cotten", "Walter Pidgeon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Rennie.\n\n\t\"Be careful, Earth\" is the message. Reasonably intelligent for this sort of thing. (How many other movies starring Michael Rennie can you name?) Pidgeon and Nielsen were in \"Forbidden Planet\". \n"}, {"text": "\"Forbidden Planet\" deals with the end of a civilization other than Earth. How is that civilization decimated?", "correct": "Unconscious thoughts and feelings were transformed into reality", "options": ["A series of natural disasters caused the planet to collapse", "The super civilization was conquered by an even more advanced civilization", "The civilization was destroyed in an instant by a collision with a huge asteroid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUnconscious thoughts and feelings were transformed into reality.\n\n\tWith Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis. \"Monsters from the id\" was the phrase - the \"id\" was Freud's term for unconscious instincts and impulses, etc. Based on \"The Tempest\" by Shakespeare. \n"}]}
