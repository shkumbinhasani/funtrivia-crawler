Complete the verse: \"Why are ye __________, o ye of little _______?\"", "correct": "fearful, faith", "options": ["ignorant, interest", "angry, apathy", "happy, heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nfearful, faith.\n\n\tMatthew 8:26 says, \"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.\"\r Faith is a common theme throughout the Bible.  At one point Jesus tells his disciples that if they had the faith of a mustard seed (which is a very small seed) they could move mountains. In chapter 14, when Peter is walking on the water, he loses faith and starts to sink, and Jesus asks him why he has so little faith. \n"}, {"text": "What does Jesus say He will do to those who deny Him before man?

If we look at the rest of the Bible, this makes sense, because if these two things are followed, the Ten Commandments will fall into place. \n"}, {"text": "Who will be set on the right, according to Matthew 25: the sheep or the goats?", "correct": "sheep", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nsheep.\n\n\tMatthew 25:33 says, \"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\"\r The sheep represent the people that have done what the Lord asked by helping those who had less than them.
