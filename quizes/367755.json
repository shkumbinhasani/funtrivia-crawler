{"id": "367755", "name": "\"Bart the Murderer\" Quiz | 'Simpsons' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Who took the 'Glow in the Dark Police Badge' from Bart's breakfast cereal?", "correct": "Homer", "options": ["Lisa", "Maggie", "Marge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer.\n\n\tThe sun rises on a new day in Springfield as Bart awakens to the sound of his Krusty the Clown alarm clock and promptly steps out of bed onto a dinosaur toy.  Bart is thrilled nonetheless; his class is going on a field trip in the afternoon and all of his homework is done.  When he searches for the prize in his box of Chocolate Frosted Krusty-Os (a Glow in the Dark Police Badge), he doesn't find it; Homer got to it first.  That's the first bad thing to happen. \n"}, {"text": "To where was Bart's field trip permission slip meant to take him?", "correct": "The chocolate factory", "options": ["The box factory", "The county fair", "Shelbyville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe chocolate factory.\n\n\tThings only get worse for Bart as the day progresses.  When he heads upstairs to get ready for school, he finds that Santa's Little Helper has eaten his homework, literally.  Still dressed in his pajamas, Bart also misses the bus, running into its door as it drives off.  Then it starts to rain (stopping only when he arrives at school).  He ends up forty minutes late and, at recess, he rips his pants performing for girls on the playground...and gets hit in the head with a ball. When the time finally comes for the school field trip to the chocolate factory, Bart realizes that he left his permission slip under his pillow, signed. \n"}, {"text": "What is Bart forced to do while his schoolmates are at the field trip?", "correct": "Lick envelopes", "options": ["Sharpen pencils", "Write lines", "Clean the blackboards"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLick envelopes.\n\n\tBart's forced to stay at school with Principal Skinner, taking his time to lick envelopes to the PTA for the remainder of the school day while his schoolmates are able to run free in the Springfield Chocolate Factory.  The tedium becomes so unbearable that the clock seems to go backwards, and by the end, Bart's tongue so completely dry that he can't talk.  When he gets outside again, it immediately starts to rain, and the school bus, returning from the trip, splashes him with water. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these alcoholic drinks does Fat Tony force Bart to make?", "correct": "Manhattan", "options": ["Gin and Tonic", "Screwdriver", "Cosmopolitan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nManhattan.\n\n\tAs Bart skateboards home in the rain, one of his front wheels falls off, leading him to skid down the sidewalk uncontrollably, tumbling down some stairs and into the aim of several firearms.  As it turns out, he's landed in front of the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club operated by Fat Tony and his mobsters. They bring him in and show him around (to their bar and card table) before forcing him to make a selection in the Shelbyville Downs horse races (which he ends up winning by choosing 'Don't Have a Cow').  When Bart successfully makes a Manhattan for one of the mob members, they offer him an after-school job. \n"}, {"text": "To help Fat Tony, Bart ends up stowing away hundreds of which of these smuggled goods?", "correct": "Cartons of cigarettes", "options": ["Snuff films", "Bottles of rum", "Boxes of nudey magazines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCartons of cigarettes.\n\n\tBart ends up enjoying his new job despite Marge's concerns and, despite earning only $30 a week, he ends up getting several tips serving drinks to men who are obviously in the mafia.  At one point, Marge ends up finding hundreds in Bart's shorts pocket while doing the laundry.\rAt one point, Police Chief Wiggum ends up stopping by to warn Fat Tony that he'll put him behind bars, but after a Manhattan, he ends up being dissuaded from believing the mob stole an entire trucks-worth of Laramie Cigarette cartons.  Homer found many of them stashed in Bart's room, mainly because there was no more room in the secret warehouse.  Homer thought nothing of it when it showed on the news, but Bart started to have some thoughts about his employers. \n"}, {"text": "To thank Bart for being an accomplice to a smuggling operation, Fat Tony gives him which of these as a gift?", "correct": "A suit", "options": ["A bar set", "A gun", "$1,000"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA suit.\n\n\tTo thank Bart and ease his conscience, Fat Tony ends up buying the boy a suit and lays out the truth for him with a bit of clever rhetoric.  Marge, meanwhile, seeing Bart in his new outfit, starts to worry that despite his part-time job, he's working for criminals.  She insists that Homer head down to Fat Tony's club to determine what kind of people Bart's working for, mainly because she's concerned that they're being spied on by the pizza truck outside.  They are.\rWhen Homer stops by, he's delighted to continuously win poker against the cheating mobsters.  He allows Bart to keep working for the mob, somewhat putting Marge at ease. \n"}, {"text": "Why was Bart kept after school and forced to show up late for work?", "correct": "He tried to bribe the Principal", "options": ["He insulted Mrs. Krabappel", "He was caught stealing", "He got into a fight with another student"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe tried to bribe the Principal.\n\n\tAt school, Bart gets caught leading a group of vandals and, to stop Principal Skinner from punishing him, he ends up slipping him a bribe.  Unfortunately, that doesn't go over too well; Skinner keeps him in for detention, doing lines and making him late for a very important event at the mob bar.  Fat Tony and the others, with a long table of 'associates', are forced to make a Manhattan without Bart, leading Fat Tony to receive 'the kiss of death'.  Bart finally shows up and explains and Fat Tony decides to give Skinner some trouble.  The next day, Principal Skinner has gone missing. \n"}, {"text": "To find the missing Principal Skinner, the police hire which of these?", "correct": "A psychic", "options": ["An animal handler", "The mob", "Private investigators"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA psychic.\n\n\tSeveral days pass and many assume Skinner to be quite dead.  The police are even forced to call in a psychic.  A memorial plaque is placed under a fire hose at school in a small ceremony, and the schoolchildren are already making jokes about where and how he died.  At night, Bart has terrible nightmares about a zombie Skinner returning from the dead to attack him before he's sent to death row and stuck into the electric chair.  This forces him to confront his employers (who don't admit to the murder).  Of course, that's when the police show up and take them all to jail...including Bart. \n"}, {"text": "Does anybody end up getting declared 'Guilty' for the murder of Principal Skinner?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tTo protect Bart, the Simpsons are forced to hire Lionel Hutz who seems a bit excited about the case and his involvement in it.  When the trial occurs, Bart is shocked to find that all of the mobsters, including Fat Tony, have decided to gang up against him and frame him not only as the murderer, but the leader of the Springfield Mafia. Unfortunately, even Homer takes to the stand and admits that Bart must be their leader since all the pieces fit.  On the day of his sentencing, moments before the final judgment is passed, the proceedings are brought to a halt by the reappearance of Principal Skinner. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Principal Skinner when he was allegedly missing?", "correct": "In his home", "options": ["In the school", "Springfield Gorge", "Florida"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn his home.\n\n\tSkinner has to explain.  A week before, Fat Tony and the others simply came into his office to talk about how great Bart has been before leaving.  When Skinner went home, however, he started to bundle old newspapers and they fell down on him, trapping him.  Although the police searched his house they didn't check his garage, even when he was yelling into an adjacent room.  Inevitably, he had to MacGyver his way out of the situation with a vacuum cleaner and some household chemistry.\rAfter the trial, Bart ends up quitting his job, realizing that crime doesn't pay.  A made-for-TV movie about the case, called 'Blood on the Chalkboard', is made chronicling the events (in a negative light, of course), with a young Neil Patrick Harris playing the role of Bart. \n"}]}
