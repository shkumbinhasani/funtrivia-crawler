H. Lawrence's classic Oedipal novel.  'Fathers and ____ and Lovers' (Fill in the blank) \n", "correct": "Sons", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSons.\n\n\tTurgenev's greatest novel 'Fathers and Sons' (1862) introduced the west to the concept of 'nihilism'.  D. H. Lawrence wrote 'Sons and Lovers' in 1913, a novel that features Paul Morel, a young man who hates his father but is incessantly devoted to his mother. \n"}, {"text": "If Jonathan Swift's most famous character set out with John Steinbeck's pet poodle, what would be the resultant title?  ", "correct": "Gulliver's Travels with Charlie & Gullivers Travels with Charlie & Gullivers Travels with Charley & Gulliver's Travels with Charley", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGulliver's Travels with Charlie & Gullivers Travels with Charlie & Gullivers Travels with Charley & Gulliver's Travels with Charley.\n\n\tSwift's 'Gulliver's Travels' (1726) was the consummate children's fantasy for generations, and contained political and social commentary to boot!  Steinbeck charmed us with his very personal 'Travels with Charlie', the story of a crotchety old writer and his pet poodle.  I recommend both! \n"}, {"text": "A short story by Edgar Allan Poe meets the Congo, led by Joseph Conrad.  Combined they become: 'The Tell-Tale _____ of Darkness' (Fill in the blank)  ", "correct": "Heart", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeart.\n\n\t'The Tell-Tale Heart' (1843) is another of Poe's many chilling short stories which explores human nature at its darkest levels.  Speaking of human nature, if you want a more drawn out exploration of it (in colonial Africa), perhaps you should read 'Heart of Darkness' (1902) by Conrad. \n"}, {"text": "When a John Grisham book, which was made into a movie starring Sandra Bullock and Samuel Jackson, meets a Harper Lee novel, also made into a film starring Gregory Peck, what is the result?  'A Time _______________' (Fill in the last four words)  ", "correct": "A Time to Kill a Mockingbird & To Kill a Mockingbird", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Time to Kill a Mockingbird & To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\n\tAnd interestingly enough, both Grisham's 'A Time to Kill' (Book: 1993, Film: 1996) and Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (Book: 1960, Film: 1962) involved court cases and the issue of racism.  Perhaps it's not too late to have Atticus Finch defend Carl Lee Hailey? \n"}, {"text": "What if a series of short stories by American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne were merged with a short story by another American novelist, Jack London?  We would get: 'Twice-Told ____ of the Fish Patrol' (Fill in the blank)   \n", "correct": "Tales", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTales.\n\n\tHawthorne's 'Twice-Told Tales' were fittingly printed twice, in 1837 and again in 1851.  London's 'Tales of the Fish Patrol' was one if his lesser-known earlier works, roughly covering some of his youthful experiences. \n"}, {"text": "A quiz like this wouldn't be complete without a Jane Austen novel.  Choose one of her most famous novels and combine it with a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine.  What do you have?  ", "correct": "Common Sense and Sensibility", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommon Sense and Sensibility.\n\n\tTom Paine's 'Common Sense' (1776) helped stir up a revolution in the British American colonies.  Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility' (1811) didn't quite stir up such a froth, but it is still one of the great novels of all time (and her first published novel). \n"}, {"text": "Combine one of Dickens' most depressing titles with the title of an A. A. Milne classic starring Winnie the Pooh and you would have 'Bleak _____ at Pooh Corner'. (Fill in the blank)  \n", "correct": "House", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse.\n\n\t'Bleak House' (1852-3) is a classic Dickensian tale, much in the mold of his many other London-based books, meandering and abundant with characters and plot twists.  'The House at Pooh Corner' (1928) is the wonderful follow-up to Milne's 'Winnie the Pooh'.   In this book, Tigger is introduced for the first time...a must read for every child. \n"}, {"text": "If Herman Wouk and Leo Tolstoy were ever to meet and collaborate, they might have come up with the following title, 'The Winds _________ Peace.'  (Fill in the blank)  ", "correct": "The Winds of War and Peace & of War and & of War and Peace", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Winds of War and Peace & of War and & of War and Peace.\n\n\t'The Winds of War' (1971) was one of several historical novels written by Wouk, this one exploring the period leading up to WWII.  It was later made into a mini-series.  If a mini-series is ever made about Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' (1865-9), dealing with the Napoleonic period in Russia, better plan on it being a long one (actually, several film and television versions have been made)! \n"}, {"text": "Horatio Alger, Jr.'s series of novels for kids that includes such characters as Telegraph Boy, Julius the Street Boy, and Slow and Sure suddenly becomes merged with Henry Fielding's greatest classic.

Henry Fielding's picaresque 'Tom Jones' (1749) was an early example of the novel form in English literature, one of the first to include a three-dimensional character. \n"}, {"text": "Look out!

What has been the result of this 'accident'?  ", "correct": "Main Streetcar Named Desire&Main Street car Named Desire", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMain Streetcar Named Desire&Main Street car Named Desire.\n\n\t'Main Street' (1920) was Lewis's first major success, and launched a career of satirizing middle America.  'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1947) was one of many excellent stage creations from Williams, and was turned into a film featuring Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando.  Thank you for having a go at this, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed putting it together...salut! \n"}]}
