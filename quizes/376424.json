Edmund Halley was one of the noted astronomers to witness the 3 minutes 33 seconds of totality from Greenwich. The next total eclipse visible from Great Britain occurred just a few years later, in 1724. However, it tracked from south Wales across to West Sussex but passed south of London. That was, though, the last total eclipse visible from anywhere in the UK until 1925. \r London had seen numerous eclipses in the centuries preceding the 1715 event, but would not witness another for almost 900 years. The next one visible from London will occur early in the 27th century.

Construction began on the River Mersey in Liverpool in 1709 and was completed six years later. The 'wet dock' was created by capturing a natural tidal pool of the river and building quay walls to lock it in. More than 100 ships could be accommodated within the dock. The dock elevated Liverpool to the world's biggest port for the slave trade. \r With ship sizes growing, the dock built on the tidal creek which had given the city its name, became too small within a hundred years, and was closed in 1826. It was paved over and a Custom House built on the site. Since 2004, a water feature has occupied the site to reflect its place in history. \n"}, {"text": "This future emperor was born on October 23, 1715.
