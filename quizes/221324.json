What I found is that Presidential campaigns aren't about these things.They're about clawing your opponents eyes out as long as you don't get tagged for it. So how about this: I will never say anything about my opponents, or anything about anything, without saying it myself, right into the camera. You might not get to hear much of me, but when you do, you'll know I stand by it.
