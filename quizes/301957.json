For my favorite \"A\" dog, I chose which Siberian husky?", "correct": "Avalanche", "options": ["Admiral", "Ally", "Aurora"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvalanche.\n\n\tYes, all four of these are some of my favorites.  :-)  Admiral is a penguin, Ally is an alligator, and Aurora is a polar bear.  Avalanche is a Siberian Husky, who is very soft.\r \"I love playing in the snow \rNo better place to be, you know \rBut a close second might just be \rSnuggled up, just you and me!\" \n"}, {"text": "For the \"B\", I chose yet another dog.  Which of these is a dog?", "correct": "Brutus", "options": ["Bunyip", "Bruce", "Brumba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrutus.\n\n\tBrutus is a rottweiler.  He is very soft, and is black and brown.\r \"Just because I'm big and tough\rThat doesn't mean that I am gruff\rSo please don't think that I'm a brute\rJust look at me . . . aren't I too cute?!\" \n"}, {"text": "Yes, more puppies for \"C\"!  Which of these is an all white dog?", "correct": "Cargo", "options": ["Chicago", "Cairo", "Carlo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCargo.\n\n\tCargo is an all white dog, with very soft fabric.  He looks just like Bounds, Chaser, and Diggidy, but with much softer fur.

Which of these is a golden retriever puppy?", "correct": "Dooley", "options": ["Deputy", "Doby", "Dundee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDooley.\n\n\tDooley is the only golden retriever in the list of options.  Deputy is a mutt, with a dark brown patch around his eye, Doby is a doberman pinscher, and Dundee looks like an all white Scotty dog.  Dooley is a light brownish tan color, with extremely fuzzy and curly hair.\r \"Please throw that rubber ball to me\rAnd I will catch it...watch and see\rThen I will bring it back to you\rPlaying catch is fun to do!\" \n"}, {"text": "Finally off of puppies for once!  Part of this is due to the fact that there is no Beanie Baby dog starting with an \"E\".  My favorite \"E\" Beanie Baby happens to be that of a baby chick.  She is just so cute popping up out of her shell.  Who is she?", "correct": "Eggbert", "options": ["Eggnog", "Eggs", "Eggerton"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEggbert.\n\n\tEggs is a series of bears, Eggerton is a rabbit, and Eggnog is another bear.  Eggbert is a little yellow chick sticking her head out of half of a shell.\r \"Cracking her shell taking a peek\rLook, she's playing hide and seek\rReady or not, here I come\rTake me home and have some fun!\" \n"}, {"text": "I had a tough time choosing between a cat and a lamb, but I finally picked what lamb?", "correct": "Fleece", "options": ["Flip", "Fetch", "Fridge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFleece.\n\n\tYes, Fleece is a lamb.  She is all the same color, a soft coat of a pale eggshell white color.  Flip is an all white cat, my second pick.  Fetch is a labrador retriever, and Fridge is a polar bear.\r \"Fleece would like to sing a lullaby\rBut please be patient, she's rather shy\rWhen you sleep, keep her by your ear\rHer song will leave you nothing to fear.\" \n"}, {"text": "I had a tough time with \"G\" Beanie Babies.  In my opinion, most are pretty ugly.  My favorite turned out to be a goat.  What is the goat's name?", "correct": "Goatee", "options": ["Goaty", "Goatie", "Goatey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoatee.\n\n\tGoatee is a goat with a goatee.  Convenient due to her name, isn't it?  Although it is a female, Goatee still has a beard and horns!\r \"Though she's hungry, she's in a good mood\rSearching through garbage, tin cans for food\rFor Goatee the goat, it's not a big deal \rAnything at all makes a fine meal!\" \n"}, {"text": "You guessed it, more puppies!  Which \"H\" dog wears a bandana around his neck?", "correct": "Hobo", "options": ["Houston", "Huggins", "Herder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHobo.\n\n\tBoth Herder and Hobo are sheepdogs.  Hobo is the only one who wears a bandana.  His bandana is red with a paisley pattern on it.  Houston and Huggins are both dogs, neither of which are sheepdogs, OR have a bandana around their necks!\r \"Around my neck or on my head \rTied in a knot or bow instead \rMy bandana is so cool you see \rIt's my favorite accessory!\" \n"}, {"text": "For \"I\", we move onto an endangered animal.  Which of these is an animal threatened by global warming?", "correct": "Icepack", "options": ["Ivory", "Inky", "India"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIcepack.\n\n\tWhile ivory is viewed very highly in Africa, and can sell for a lot of money, elephants are not affected by global warming near as much as a polar bear, the animal Icepack is.  Besides, Ivory is a bear!  Inky may face danger from larger predators in the ocean, and humans, as he is an octopus, but melting ice would not bother him too much. In fact, he may enjoy it, because more water means more places for him to explore!  India is extremely threatened by hunters and habitat loss, as she is a tiger, but melting ice does not affect her nearly as much as our friend Icepack!  Icepack is threated by both poachers, or hunters, and global warming, which causes their home to slowly shrink in size. Icepack does not have a poem. \n"}, {"text": "There are probably more \"J\" Beanie Babies than you would expect.  I happened to pick another Siberian husky as my favorite.  Who could this be?", "correct": "Juneau", "options": ["Jersey", "Jake", "Jabber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJuneau.\n\n\tJabber is a parrot, and he talks a lot, thus giving him his name.  Jersey is a bull, more precisely a Jersey holstein cow, or something like that.  :-D  Jake is a mallard duck, which is the duck with a greenish blue head!  Juneau is a very soft Siberian husky who loves sled racing, and was named after the capital of Alaska.\r \"Hurry, jump on, I'll pull the sled\rOr we could play snow-tag instead\rEither way we'll have such fun\rWhat can I say? I love to run!\" \n"}]}
