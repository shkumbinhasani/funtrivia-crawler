{"id": "397078", "name": "Ant-Man Quiz | Ant-Man | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "     Movies A-C", "Ant-Man"], "questions": [{"text": "Where was Scott Lang in prison?", "correct": "San Quentin", "options": ["Folsom", "Riker's Island", "Sing Sing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Quentin.\n\n\tIn 1989, while the Triskelion was being constructed in Washington D.C., Hank Pym entered the boardroom with the claim that his research was being copied by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s people.  Howard Stark, believing that it could be put to good use, urged him to relax.  Instead, Pym resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D., suggesting that as long as he was alive, no one would have the formula for the Pym Particle.\rIn the present day, Scott Lang leaves San Quentin Penitentiary and gets picked up by his old cellmate, Luis, who was a set free a year earlier.  Scott, knowing he has a daughter on the outside, says he looks forward to not getting involved in anything dangerous or illegal anymore.  And that's why he takes his job back at Baskin-Robbins...and immediately gets found out and fired. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Darren Cross's weapon?", "correct": "Yellowjacket", "options": ["Bumblebee", "Wasp", "Hornet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYellowjacket.\n\n\tHank heads through San Francisco on foot, eventually getting back to Luis' place to meet Kurt and Dave, the former of whom was in Folsom for five years.  Luis tells the guys that Hank did that Vista Job, taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor, kind of like a cat burglar.  Luis explains that he has the perfect job for all of them, but Scott holds firm, too far from eager to take the mantle back up.\rHank Pym visits Pym Technologies for the first time in a while having been forced out by his daughter, Hope, and his former colleague, Darren Cross.  The reason for his arrival is a bit mysterious, and Hank doesn't know too much about it, but when he finds out that Cross has been researching a way to minimize the space between atoms while increasing density and strength, it becomes clear that he's started to unlock the truth behind shrinking a human being.  Cross claims it's the end of warfare as they know it-- the Yellowjacket, a weapon of war designed to shrink down the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage.  As the investors depart, Pym warns Cross away from his research, fearing that the results could be terrible for the planet.  When Cross leaves as well, Hope tells her father that they need to make their move soon, especially while she has Cross' full trust.  Hank, however, says there's still time, especially since he found a potential candidate. \n"}, {"text": "Scott Lang has one child.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tScott heads to his young daughter Maggie's birthday party uninvited, giving her an ugly toy (which she loves) but getting a bit of blowback from his ex-wife, Maggie, and her new fiance, Paxton, Scott is asked to leave.  Maggie recommends that he get his life back in order and she promises they can discuss visitation then.\rAt Pym Technologies, Darren Cross speaks to one of his detractors, attempting to use his technology to shrink him down against his will.  It doesn't work; the method just isn't ready.\rHeading back to Luis', Scott tries to solve his problem and attempt to raise money for child support, but his calculations indicate that he won't be able to see his daughter for more than a year under the right circumstances.  That's why he decides to listen to Luis' plan about a safe in an old man's basement.  It seems like the right job, even if the details are hazy, and after a bit of work, they have all the tools they need to perform the robbery. \n"}, {"text": "How is Scott able to break open Hank Pym's safe?", "correct": "By freezing it", "options": ["By inputting the code", "By using a key", "By removing the hinges"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy freezing it.\n\n\tThe night of the heist, Kurt knocks out the phone lines as Scott hops over the fence and climbs into an upper floor window of the target house, blocking the alarm system for twenty minutes on his way.  Heading inside, he beelines straight for the basement and finds the safe.  He's put off by a fingerprint scanner on the door, but with quick thinking he uses a piece of tape and manages to extract a full print from a household item, unlocking the safe door instantly...and finding a second safe.  This one is an older model, though a strong one, and Scott gets to work quickly, drilling into the door and freezing the lock mechanism to burst it open.\rThere's not much in the safe-- just an old motorcycle suit and some useless blueprints.  He takes it anyways, not noticing that someone is watching from a camera the size of a small bug.  Pym, from a surveillance room, spies on the whole operation.\rIn the labs, Darren Cross tries to shrink larger and larger creatures without any ethical concern.  Once again, it doesn't work. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Scott when he tries on the suit for the first time?", "correct": "In the bathroom", "options": ["In his van", "In jail", "In a laboratory"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the bathroom.\n\n\tScott, at his end, takes a look at the motorcycle suit in his bathroom and assembles its pieces before trying it on in front of the mirror.  Luis and the guys return home and, in a panic, Scott presses some of the buttons on the outfit, unwittingly shrinking himself to no more than the size of an ant and falling into the bathtub.  Luis, not seeing him, runs the water in the tub while Scott hears Hank Pym's voice through the helmet.  What follows is a test ride where, too small to be noticed, he falls through the floors of Luis' apartment building, crashing through parties, into vacuums, and out windows to the street.  He finally reverts back to his normal size when he lands on a taxicab outside.  Pym assures him he'll be in touch.\rIt doesn't much matter.  Scott rushes back to Pym's basement that night and puts the suit back, but the cops arrive and haul him off to jail where, after a short time, Paxton informs him that his lawyer is there to speak to him.  This is interesting since Scott doesn't have a lawyer.  Instead, it's Pym, and he makes a compelling case: Scott can stay in prison or he can go back to his cell and await further instructions.  After all, Pym put this whole plan into motion, leading Scott to show up in his basement, from the moment he left prison.  Sure enough, when Scott goes back to his cell, the suit is delivered to him by ants which, when controlled, blow it back up to human size.  Seizing the opportunity, Scott speedily dons the suit and shrinks down to ant size, making a very unorthodox prison break.  Hank's ants swoop in and fly him away before anyone can spot anything. \n"}, {"text": "Darren Cross realizes that he has the key to Pym's formula when he is able to shrink which of these?", "correct": "Lamb", "options": ["Human", "Dog", "Cat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLamb.\n\n\tScott wakes up in a bedroom with Hope watching over him and before long, they're called out for tea.  Hank explains then that Hope was the one who called the cops, believing Scott to be a waste of their time.  Hank, however, believes otherwise since he had Scott steal the suit for a reason-- he liked Scott's burglary of Vista Corp.  Hank takes him to the basement to explain how the suit works.  Because it was too dangerous, he hid it from the world, but Darren Cross has since made great strides in recreating his formula.  The problem is that the formula, when used in excess, can affect brain chemistry.  What he wants is for Scott to take a shot at redemption.  In return, Scott needs to do what he does best-- burgle.  They need to steal Yellowjacket and destroy the data of it.  And all this without calling the Avengers; Pym has worked to hard to keep it out of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hands to call them in.\rAt Pym Technologies, Hope watches as Darren's tinkering with the formula finally results in success.  Their time is short. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these types of ants does Scott not use for his mission?", "correct": "Harvester Ants", "options": ["Carpenter Ants", "Bullet Ants", "Fire Ants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarvester Ants.\n\n\tHope steps up, suggesting that she's the best person to don the Ant-Man suit and infiltrate Pym Technologies, but Hank refuses to let her; Scott is their only option, and it's Scott's opportunity to be a hero for his daughter.  He accepts and, very quickly, Hank and Hope train him to not only use the suit, but fight effectively.  One day, Scott considers tinkering a bit with the suit's regulator, but Hank tells him not to since it could make him subatomic, shrinking him into the Quantum Realm and transforming him for all eternity.  The father-daughter duo also introduce Scott to the ants he'll be working with on his mission-- Crazy Ants, Bullet Ants, Carpenter Ants, and Fire Ants-- and try to help him get the hang of controlling them with a special earpiece.  It all leads to a big argument between Hank and Hope with the latter angry that her father keeps lying, specifically about her mother's death when she was seven years old.  Scott defuses the argument and Hope apologizes to him not only for her mood, but for calling the cops on him.  It's her tips that allow Scott to contact and compel the ants.\rWhen Scott and Hope head back into the house, Hank tells the truth, finally, about Hope's mother, Janet.  Janet convinced Hank to let her join in his missions; he created an outfit for her-- the Wasp outfit-- and in 1987, when they were on a mission to stop a subatomic bomb launched by the Soviet Union, she went subatomic to bring it down.  She was lost to the Quantum Realm on that day and never seen again.  Finally, Hank and Hope are able to make peace. \n"}, {"text": "Which Avenger does Scott face off against at the Avengers' HQ?", "correct": "Falcon", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Black Widow", "War Machine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalcon.\n\n\tThere's one last thing Scott needs to do before infiltrating Pym Technologies.  Specifically, he needs to stowaway onboard a plane and intercept a signal decoy made by Stark Industries as it heads to Avengers HQ.  Scott launches with the Carpenter Ants in tow, arriving on the roof of the Avengers' warehouse only to be intercepted by Falcon, alerted to the arrival by a security alert.  Scott resizes to human form and asks politely for the signal device, but Falcon tries to apprehend him instead, and it leads to a fight across the grounds.  Though Falcon is easily able to locate Scott with his suit, Scott is able to shrink down and sneak into Falcon's gear to rewire some of the components, neutralizing the threat so that he can abscond with the tech he needs.\rReturning to Pym's house with the device, Hank criticizes his approach, but they all have to admit that his success is a positive.  When Pym leaves the room he finds Darren Cross standing in his living room, apparently there to invite him to the Pym Technologies building the next day to celebrate the discovery of the proper formula.  Cross doesn't locate any hint of the plans, but when he leaves he phones Hope, informing her that they'll need to triple security and place steel micromesh over all of the vents.  Their new plan: they need a team to get in and depressurize the building's water main so Scott can get in.  So they invite Luis, Kurt, and Dave in to help. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these ends up arriving to buy Darren Cross' technology?", "correct": "Hydra", "options": ["S.H.I.E.L.D.", "Stark Industries", "The Avengers Initiative"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydra.\n\n\tThe next night, the plan is put into action as Luis heads into Pym Technologies as a guard and depressurizes the water main.  Riding in on a raft of fire ants, Scott navigates his way through the pipes to the extraction point-- a bathroom sink.  With Luis and the ants' help, Hope places the signal decoy just in time. Pym arrives to meet Hope and Cross in the lobby and the three of them head to the Yellowjacket chamber to meet with Cross' investors.  At the same time, Lang and the ants head into the server room, frying the stacks with the crazy ants before setting explosive charges.  Scott descends into the Yellowjacket chamber as Pym is introduced to the investors-- members of Hydra looking to snag the technology-- and as it turns out, Cross is already aware of his presence. Cross locks him away in the Yellowjacket chamber and, his brain chemistry affected by the formula, he decides to kill Pym.  He does shoot Hank, but he fails to kill him as Scott is able to use his tools to escape the containment unit, defeat the Hydra henchmen, and get in the way.  The Pym Technologies labs are destroyed by the explosives, but Scott, Hank, Hope, and Darren all escape...and so does the Hydra leader, who leaves with a vial of the formula and disappears.  Cross, still in the fight, decides to expand the Yellowjacket, don it, and face off against Scott. \n"}, {"text": "Is Scott able to visit the Quantum Realm and return from it?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tScott and Darren's fight spills into the San Francisco suburbs, but it doesn't last too long since Maggie's fiance, Paxton, has been on the case for a while and arrives to arrest Lang for his earlier jailbreak, throwing him into the back of a cop car.  Both of them are lucky enough to hear the police radio call out Maggie's address as Cross has come in to grab Scott's daughter as ransom.  Lang, bringing in the ants for backup, forces Cross to shrink down and fight him through Cassie's room, but the pair's shifting sizes are what ultimately gives Scott the opportunity he needs to break into the Yellowjacket's titanium exterior and protect his daughter.  To beat Cross, he toys with the controls of his own suit, shrinking to subatomic levels and entering the Quantum Realm, breaking down Cross' suit in the process and causing him to shrink infinitely.\rScott also shrinks infinitely, trapped in an empty and endless realm, alone.  All he can hear, however, is Cassie's voice, and thinking quickly, he grabs one of Pym's devices and activates it, miraculously enlarging to normal size and reforming in his daughter's room.\rFor saving Cassie, Paxton covers for Scott to prevent him from being apprehended once again.  In the following days, Pym, amazed that Scott could survive in the Quantum Realm, tries to get more info from him.  As Scott departs, Hank wonders if it's possible he could find his wife.  When Hank leaves the room, he comes across Scott and Hope kissing behind the door.\rThat night, Luis' connections come through with a new job.  As it turns out, these connections lead back to Falcon, and the Avengers are looking for Scott. \n"}]}
