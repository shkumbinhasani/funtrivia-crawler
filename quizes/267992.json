{"id": "267992", "name": "Hard An Allergist's Guide to World Cuisine Quiz / Test | Hobbies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Food & Drink", "International Cuisine"], "questions": [{"text": "Charlotte comes to the office with a question about the menu for a birthday party she's planning. \"The restaurant has a list of appetizers to choose from,\" she tells Dr. Lergy, \"but they all sound like seafood to me!\" Poor Charlotte can't eat anything that's lived in water. Which of the following dishes is safe for her?", "correct": "Rocky Mountain oysters", "options": ["Crawdad gumbo", "Calamari", "Shrimp scampi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRocky Mountain oysters.\n\n\tCommon in ranching areas of the western United States and Canada, Rocky Mountain oysters are actually a beef product; they are what is left behind, as it were, when a bull is gelded. They are usually served deep-fried after being coated in salt, pepper, and flour. Other common names for the dish include prairie oysters, sweetmeats, calf fries, and huevos de toro (\"bull eggs\").\r Crawdad gumbo, a Louisiana specialty, is a stew that incorporates crayfish (often called crawdads), lobster-like crustaceans found in freshwater rivers around the world. Scampi comes from the Italian for \"lobster,\" but in the U.K. and the U.S. it has come to refer to that particular serving style -- leading to the etymologically hilarious menu item \"chicken scampi.\" Calamari, meanwhile, refers to squid that has been served as food (often fried). \n"}, {"text": "Alice tells Dr. Lergy that she's thrilled about her upcoming tour of South America, but there's one problem: her serious allergy to citrus fruit. \"Lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruit -- any one of them could ruin my vacation,\" she says. Which of these national dishes should Alice avoid?", "correct": "Ceviche (Peru)", "options": ["Curanto (Chile)", "Ajiaco Bogotano (Colombia)", "Carne con chimichurri (Argentina)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeviche (Peru).\n\n\tCeviche, a seafood salad, is popular not only in Peru but also up and down the coast of Latin America. The fish in ceviche is not cooked; instead, it's marinated in a citrus sauce, which pickles the meat and gives it a taste close to that of cooked fish. Lemons and limes are most commonly used for the marinade, though oranges are also popular.\r Instead, Alice can enjoy a variety of other dishes, including ajiaco Bogotano (a chicken soup made with corn, potatoes, avocado, herbs, and sour cream); carne con chimichurri (grilled steak marinated in a pesto-like herb sauce); and curanto (a mixture of shellfish, potatoes, meat, bread, and vegetables, pressure-cooked in a hole over a meter deep). She should be careful in Brazil, though; feijoada, the bean-and-beef stew that is the national dish there, is traditionally served with oranges. \n"}, {"text": "Mildred, a student about to reach the legal drinking age, comes to the office for advice on her upcoming birthday celebrations. \"I'd like to celebrate at an international bar with my friends,\" she tells the doctor, \"but I'm worried about my rice allergy.\" Which of these drinks would be a dangerous selection?", "correct": "Sake", "options": ["Tequila", "Mead", "Pisco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSake.\n\n\tSake is a Japanese beverage made by fermenting rice. The process has two main stages: first enzymes are used to convert the starch to sugar, and then the addition of yeast allows the sugar to ferment into alcohol. (According to some theories of sake's origins, early brewers used saliva to provide the enzymes for the first stage!) In some regions, sake refers to other alcoholic beverages not made from rice (some sakes from Kyushu are derived from sweet potatoes, for example), but Mildred had better not take that chance!\r Mead is a strong drink made from fermented honey, popular in Europe and Ethiopia and immortalized in countless Viking epics. Tequila, a Mexican innovation that is the main ingredient of margaritas, is distilled from the blue agave plant, which enjoys desert climes and high altitudes. Pisco is a popular South American grape brandy, named after a Peruvian port city and claimed by both Peru and Chile as the national drink. \n"}, {"text": "Edgar is allergic to eggs, but he's tired of having to avoid the complimentary bread at every restaurant he goes to. \"I know they don't mean to, but I feel like I'm being ripped off!\" he complains to Dr. Lergy. Which of the following breads is most likely to contain eggs?", "correct": "Skillet-baked cornbread from a southern American restaurant", "options": ["Pita from a Turkish restaurant", "Baguettes from a French restaurant", "Corn tortillas from a Mexican restaurant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkillet-baked cornbread from a southern American restaurant.\n\n\tSkillet-baked cornbread, also called hoecake, is a dish with a long history in the southeastern United States. The skillet is coated with oil, lard or bacon fat, and then filled with a batter made primarily of cornmeal, buttermilk, eggs, and flour. The result is a moist, crumbly bread with a crunchy crust, most commonly served as an accompaniment to meals. It's related to johnnycakes, corn pone, and hush puppies, among other dishes, and the question of whether or not to add sugar is a bone of contention between Northerners and Southerners!\r Mediterranean pita bread is made with nothing more than yeast, flour, salt and warm water, baked at a high temperature. The baking process often causes the bread to separate, forming a pocket in the middle, which is handy for scooping up a meal; the famous Italian food \"pizza\" derives from the word for \"pita.\" Mexican tortillas are made from a similar recipe, but with corn often substituted for flour and with the addition of oil. When fried, the tortillas end up crispy, and can be torn or cut for nachos or wrapped around a meal to make burritos or enchiladas. Finally, baguettes -- the long, thin loaves that shout \"Paris!\" to so many around the world -- are also based on that same simple pita recipe, but with a much more involved process of kneading, fermenting, and shaping. \n"}, {"text": "Alphonse is planning a vacation to India. As he shows Dr. Lergy his guidebooks and planned itinerary, he reminds him that he's terribly allergic to fish of all kinds. Which of these dishes should he avoid?", "correct": "Bombay duck", "options": ["Garlic naan", "Poha", "Sambhar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBombay duck.\n\n\tThe Bombay duck (also called a bummalo) is, strangely enough, a lizardfish! Native to the waters surrounding India, it is usually dried and salted before being sold (usually in cans), a process which makes it rather smelly. (Nevertheless, it is a delicacy; the dried version can be made into a curry, while the fresh fish is generally fried.)\r It's unclear how this fish got its misleading name, but most stories insist that \"Bombay duck\" is a corruption of \"Bombay Dak\" (the Bombay mail). Apparently the smell of the mail trains (and consequently of the mail) reminded people of the smell of the fish, and so the fish came to be called Bombay Dak. The tales vary in how the mail trains picked up this smell in the first place. Was it from shipping lizardfish, from rotting rail ties, or from some disturbing third source? Without a time machine, who can tell?\r As for the other choices, sambhar is a South Indian lentil and tamarind soup; naan is a flatbread baked in a tandoor (a hot charcoal oven); and poha is made from flakes of rice without their husks. \n"}, {"text": "Morgause has been looking forward to her Egyptian vacation for months, but her wheat allergy could hamper her enjoyment of the pyramids. Which of the following dishes is most likely to cause her trouble?", "correct": "Couscous", "options": ["Falafel balls", "Ful medames", "Mahshi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCouscous.\n\n\tCouscous, a staple food in West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, is made of tiny balls of semolina wheat that have been coated in wheat flour and steamed. It is served alone, as a side dish, or as an accompaniment to stews. It is sometimes made with pearl millet or with barley, but if Morgause doesn't speak Arabic she would be wise not to take a chance.\r Falafel balls are fried, round patties of spiced ground chickpeas (or, more commonly in Egypt, fava beans). Morgause should be sure to get them alone, as the pita bread in a falafel sandwich could give her trouble! Ful medames, a popular Egyptian dish, also involves fava beans, mashed and slow-cooked with olive oil, onion, garlic, lemons and parsley. Mahshi consists of a spicy rice-and-meat mixture stuffed into vegetables (such as bell peppers) or grape/cabbage leaves. \n"}, {"text": "Six-year-old Seth is allergic to milk, but he has his heart set on a birthday outing to a nearby dessert restaurant. Which of these desserts should Dr. Lergy advise him to try?", "correct": "Granita", "options": ["Gelato", "Flan", "Figgy pudding"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGranita.\n\n\tGranita (more formally known as granita siciliana) is a frozen Sicilian dessert, made from water, sugar, and flavorings that vary from almonds to mulberries. Its desired texture varies according to its location in Sicily: coarse and chunky in the west, and silky smooth in the east. No matter what texture the restaurant chooses, Seth should be safe (as long as the restaurant keeps its preparation equipment free of milk contamination, that is).\r Figgy pudding, of \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" fame, is a British dessert pudding whose ingredients include butter, milk, eggs, and various fruits and spices; it can be boiled, baked, or steamed before serving. Gelato is the Italian version of ice cream, smoother and denser than the American and British varieties, but still made with milk. (Sorbetto refers to dairy-free gelato, more popular in the south of Italy, but many sorbets do contain milk.) Flan refers to a caramel custard, a thickened milk-and-egg concoction; in France, a flan is a custard tart, while in Spanish-speaking countries it has a more pudding-like appearance. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Lergy has just diagnosed Paul with an allergy to soy protein, which makes most soybean products off-limits. Luckily, the doctor has a list of common soy products, which Paul reads through. \"Sho-yu sauce, miso, edamame ... hmm, it looks like one of my favorite restaurants was causing the rash!\" Paul realizes. Which type of cuisine includes those staple items?", "correct": "Japanese cuisine", "options": ["Ethiopian cuisine", "Korean cuisine", "Indian cuisine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapanese cuisine.\n\n\tSoy and seafood are two pillars of Japanese cuisine. Sho-yu sauce, the Japanese variant of soy sauce, most often contains wheat (which tends to sweeten it) in addition to the standard fermented soybeans, water, and salt; it has several regional variations. Miso, a thick paste made with salt- and kojikin-fermented soybeans (though rice or barley can be substituted), is used as the base of sauces as well as the staple miso soup. It pops up in lots of unexpected places, from pastry glazes to pickled vegetables! Edamame is the most directly soy-related dish of the lot, consisting simply of young soybeans (still in the pod) boiled together with salt or other seasonings.\r Paul should also watch out for tofu (blocks of soybean curd) and numerous other dishes; soy is used as a flavoring in items as varied as chicken broth and fast-food hamburger patties. Luckily, he's already got a set of reading glasses to use on those tiny ingredient labels! \n"}, {"text": "Annabelle's allergy to peanuts and tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, pine nuts and so on) is serious indeed -- so serious that she has always shied away from both cookies and thick sauces. \"It's really limiting my dining options,\" she tells Dr. Lergy. Which of these dishes will certainly be safe for Annabelle to eat?", "correct": "Fettuccine alfredo at an Italian-American restaurant", "options": ["Chicken satay with dipping sauce at an Indonesian restaurant", "Aji de gallina at a Peruvian restaurant", "Pasta al pesto at an Italian restaurant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFettuccine alfredo at an Italian-American restaurant.\n\n\tDespite its name, fettuccine alfredo is mostly eaten in America; in Italy, a similar dish is known as fettuccine al burro (fettuccine with butter). The long, flat fettuccine noodles are crowned with a thick white sauce, made from a combination of butter, heavy cream, and melted Parmesan cheese. Roman restaurant owner Alfredo di Lelio began serving it (named, naturally, after himself) in 1914; thrilled American tourists brought it back to the United States, where it became an emblem of Italy despite that country's lack of familiarity with its new name.\r Of the dangerous dishes, the Peruvian specialty Aji de gallina involves shredded, boiled chicken seasoned with fried onions and chilies, topped off with bread, cheese and a walnut or peanut sauce. Pesto sauce, a fixture of Italian cuisine, uses garlic, olive oil, lots of basil, cheese, and pine nuts (although walnuts are sometimes substituted). Chicken satay, popular throughout southeast Asia, is typically served with a spicy, peanut-based dipping sauce, although it is possible to get a pineapple, soy or cucumber dip instead. Annabelle should be very careful if she chooses to risk it! \n"}, {"text": "Eugene arrives at the office very upset: he had a bad reaction the previous evening, while at a Mexican restaurant. \"I was just eating a turkey dish,\" he tells Dr. Lergy, \"when all of a sudden I could barely breathe. I'm lucky I had my EpiPen with me! What's going on, Doc? I'm allergic to chocolate, not turkey!\" Which of these Mexican sauces contains chocolate?", "correct": "Mole poblano", "options": ["Salsa verde", "Guacamole", "Pico de gallo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMole poblano.\n\n\tEugene's turkey dish was most likely mole poblano de guajolote, one of the premier dishes of Mexican cuisine. The turkey is prepared with rich brown mole poblano, made from dried chilies, chocolate, sugar, ground nuts, bread or tortillas and a selection of vegetables that varies according to the chef (often including tomatoes, plantains, and onions). It takes several hours to cook to perfection.\r Eugene would have been much safer with a nice guacamole (a thick, avocado-based sauce), salsa verde (a hot chili-and-tomatillo-based sauce), or pico de gallo (a \"sauce\" of coarsely chopped raw vegetables, including tomatoes, onions, chilies, and cilantro). Luckily, he was able to top off his meal with an intramuscular injection of adrenaline (using an EpiPen syringe; TwinJect is another major brand), which eased his breathing and gave him time to get to an emergency room. Food allergies are no laughing matter! \n"}]}
