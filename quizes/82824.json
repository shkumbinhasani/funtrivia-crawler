{"id": "82824", "name": "Amy Tan's \"The Bonesetter's Daughter\" Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Authors T-Z", "T"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\" opens with a narrative by LuLing, an elderly woman who emigrated from China to the U.S. many years previously.

She puts off deciphering them for years, until she finds another chapter hidden in her mother's house and finally hires a translator. \n"}, {"text": "As the book begins, LuLing is deeply troubled about a name she has forgotten. Whose name is it?", "correct": "The woman called Precious Auntie", "options": ["Her first husband", "The woman called Mother", "The man called Baby Uncle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe woman called Precious Auntie.\n\n\tPrecious Auntie (in Mandarin, Bao Bomu) is, of course, LuLing's real mother - not the woman referred to as Mother throughout the book. Horribly burned and disfigured in a suicide attempt after the deaths of her father and husband-to-be, Precious Auntie became LuLing's nursemaid, and the child never knew her true parentage until her mother is already dead. \n"}, {"text": "LuLing's American-born daughter, Ruth, has a job that allows her to work at home - but that also makes her unsure of her importance in life. What does she do?", "correct": "She's a ghostwriter for self-help books.", "options": ["She's a telemarketer.", "She writes an advice column.", "She proofreads websites."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe's a ghostwriter for self-help books.\n\n\tWhy, Ruth wonders, is she unable to speak up for herself in her own life, while simultaneously massaging prose and writing advice for others? She has an excellent reputation in her field, but her family does not understand her work; her aunt GaoLing, for example, thinks that she basically takes dictation. As she tells Art at one point, \"I can describe how to find happiness in ten chapters, but I still don't know what it is.\" \n"}, {"text": "When the book opens, Ruth has been in a relationship for ten years. With whom does she live?", "correct": "Her boyfriend, Art, and his two daughters", "options": ["Her boyfriend, Steve, and two daughters - one theirs, and one his with his ex-wife", "Her husband, Art, and his two daughters", "Her husband, Steve, and his two sons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHer boyfriend, Art, and his two daughters.\n\n\tAfter a bitter divorce from his first wife, Art doesn't want to marry again; thus, he and Ruth are committed to each other, but they are not married.

They're teenagers when the story opens. \n"}, {"text": "In August every year, Ruth loses her voice for a week, beginning on her anniversary. This event happens at the same time as the famous annual Pleiades meteor shower. Does Ruth know why she becomes mute?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tRuth's annual muteness is one of the book's mysteries. It has been going on ever since she met Art, and has become a fun ritual within her family. Art's daughters call it \"The Days of No Talk,\" a time when they'll withdraw from work and responsibility and go on a vacation of sorts; the year the book opens, that trip is to Lake Tahoe. Ruth, however, sees her muteness as a metaphor: she finds it difficult to speak up for herself and make sure that her needs are addressed, whether she's dealing with her mother, with Art, or with his daughters. \n"}, {"text": "When did LuLing discover that Precious Auntie was really her mother?", "correct": "Just after Precious Auntie's suicide.", "options": ["Just before Precious Auntie's suicide.", "On LuLing's wedding day.", "At the New Year, when LuLing is six years old."], "explanation": "\n\n\nJust after Precious Auntie's suicide.\n\n\tLuLing wants to marry Chang Fu Nan, an alliance that will benefit both families economically.

She writes a long manuscript explaining these events to LuLing and concludes by confessing that she is the teenager's mother, not just her nursemaid.Later Precious Auntie asks, \"Now that you have read my story, what do you feel toward me?\" - and LuLing, not wanting to admit that she hasn't read the story, shouts that \"Even if the whole Chang family were murderers and thieves, I would join them just to get away from you!\" The next morning Precious Auntie has died by her own hand, the wedding is canceled, and LuLing finally reads the manuscript and learns what she has done. \n"}, {"text": "Having fallen out of favor with her family, LuLing is sent away.

Although the institution is overcrowded, they agree to take LuLing because she is literate and can tutor the other girls in reading and writing. As she matures there, she becomes a teacher and makes some of the friends who will define her young adulthood: Ruth Grutoff, the American headmistress for whom LuLing will name her daughter; Sister Yu, a good friend and a political chameleon; and her first husband and great love, the archeologist Kai Jing, son of Teacher Pan. \n"}, {"text": "After the end of the war, LuLing, GaoLing and their surviving friends discuss a matter of great importance.
