The news makes note that four people are now dead and a police officer is now missing.  The freaks, of course, know all about the detective.  Sirens approach.  The cops wish to speak to Elsa, and when they do they note that they're placing a curfew on the town to protect them from the murderer.  The freaks, of course, know that they're easy targets.\rIn town, a clerk delivers coffee to Mr. Hanley, the owner of the toy store he works at.

Jimmy is handed the officer's badge; everything else will burn to ash.\rIn their lavish house in Jupiter, Dandy and Gloria Mott sit at opposite ends of a lengthy dinner table.  Gloria rings a tiny bell for their maid to emerge with dinner-- escargot-- and Dandy goes over the edge.  Escargot is simply TOO boring.  He pours a glass of cognac while his mother tries to calm him down.  Dandy wants to be a thespian, but Gloria doesn't want him to be degraded.  As Dandy runs off to his room, Dora the maid emerges to tell Gloria that the neighbours' cat has gone missing, but there's a pile of fur and teeth behind the back shed.  Coupled with the recent murders, she's worried.  Gloria knows her son isn't responsible.

They all watch as a new trailer pulls up to the farm and the duo inside heads to Elsa's tent.  The duo is Dell Toledo and his current wife, Desiree Dupree.  Both have just come off a six month stint in Chicago for the Giuseppe Bros.Circus and are looking for a fresh start with Elsa.  Dell is a strongman while Desiree both has three breasts and is a hermaphrodite.  What they don't note is that they were forced to leave Chicago due to...erm...murderous circumstances.  When Elsa refuses their offer, Dell reveals that there's nowhere else to go and that they'll take any offer. Elsa allows them to stay so long as Dell can act as a strong, male presence who can take orders. \n"}, {"text": "While Dandy has no deformities to speak of, he insists that his knowledge of which of these should let him join the freak show?", "correct": "The entire Cole Porter canon", "options": ["The shows of Rodgers and Hammerstein", "The greater works of Shakespeare", "The inner workings of a crazed psyche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe entire Cole Porter canon.\n\n\tGloria, driving through the rural reaches of Jupiter, ends up riding down the road past a truly unusual person-- a clown.  Rolling down the window, she asks if he does private parties for children and urges that he could, perhaps, cheer up Dandy with a performance.\rDandy, meanwhile, heads to the freak show to speak to Jimmy since he wants to join the performance and become a thespian.  Dandy insists that he knows he doesn't have a deformity, but he knows the entire Cole Porter canon; he's one of them on the inside and they need to take a chance on him.  Jimmy, however, shoos him off.  Dandy takes it poorly.  When he gets home, Gloria takes him to a playroom in the mansion and introduces him to the clown she brought home. \n"}, {"text": "Neither Bette nor Dot is able to sing.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tEthel decides to stop in at Dell's trailer when Desiree takes leave for a few moments almost solely to talk about Jimmy.  She refuses to let Dell speak to Jimmy who, as it turns out, is actually his son.  She leaves angry since Dell reveals that Elsa put him in charge of the place.\rIn the main tent, Bette and Dot are told to audition to Elsa so that, as headliners, they can show off some sort of talent.  As it turns out, Bette can't sing.  When Dot is pushed by Jimmy to sing, it turns out she has a lovely voice.  She ends up singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", wowing everyone...but worrying Elsa and Bette.  After the song, Dell insists that they will have matinee performances to beat the curfew.  Elsa opposes this idea. \n"}, {"text": "Jimmy, attempting to be more normal, tries to take the freaks to which local establishment?", "correct": "Diner", "options": ["Park", "Library", "Movie theatre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiner.\n\n\tDandy has an awkward time with his new clown and, after a puppet show, urges the companion to do something entertaining.  Dandy ultimately ends up distracting the clown to go through his bag and, when he realizes, he knocks the boy out and flees into the woods.  Dandy, of course, decides to pursue his interesting, new friend.\rIn town, Jimmy brings a coterie of freaks to the local diner to try to integrate into the local community.  Dell ends up seeing the group from outside and drags Jimmy out, beating him up in front of the restaurant in full view of the others and insisting on keeping them separate from the normal people. \n"}, {"text": "Who finds the clown's bus in the woods?", "correct": "Dandy", "options": ["Dell", "Gloria", "The police"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDandy.\n\n\tIn the bus in the woods, the clown's captives struggle against the locks on their cage just as he makes his return from Dandy's house.  Unlocking the cage he decides to sit inside with his prisoners to play, but really it just gives them the opportunity to escape.  The clown goes after the young boy, but Bonnie, the older girl, ends up running directly into Dandy in the forest.  He helps her to her feet, but grabs her and returns her to the bus, insisting that they're both going to have some fun. \n"}, {"text": "Elsa is persuaded that something must be done about Dell when what happens?", "correct": "She finds she's billed lowest on the posters around town", "options": ["He has moved Desiree to the headline of the act", "He's taken over her personal tent", "He threatens to kill members of the troupe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe finds she's billed lowest on the posters around town.\n\n\tAt the farm, Jimmy heads directly to Elsa to speak to her about Dell but she's iffy on the idea of getting rid of him so soon.  Because of the threat of a killer in the area, it's good to have a man of strength among the troupe, she explains.  Jimmy reveals the badge of the cop he killed, but Elsa seems more persuaded by the playbills Dell was posting around town; she's billed at the bottom with Meep the Geek.\rSurprisingly, the matinee performance fills a few seats with Dell hosting, and is found to be more successful when Dot leads on Fiona Apple's \"Criminal\" (with Bette harmonizing).  The twins receive a standing ovation and Elsa is left to think on this. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Jimmy try to frame for murder?", "correct": "Dell", "options": ["Desiree", "Bette and Dot", "Dandy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDell.\n\n\tThe cops return the next day, this time bringing with them a fleet of cars.  Elsa emerges from her tent to meet them, this time because they have a warrant and an anonymous tip.  As it turns out, she and Jimmy called them and planted the badge in Dell's trailer.  The cops don't find it there; Dell saw Jimmy head out to plant it.  Instead, the cops find it in Meep the Geek's trailer and they haul him off to jail.  There, he's helpless.\rThat night, Bette is awakened and congratulated by Elsa while Dot sleeps next to her.  Bette, embarrassed, is simply disappointed with herself, but Elsa tries to convince her that it's Dot's fault.  She claims that Bette is really the star, and makes an attempt to leave a knife in her possession. \n"}, {"text": "Which freak is killed during this episode?", "correct": "Meep", "options": ["Dot", "Ma Petite", "Pepper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeep.\n\n\tIn the big tent, Ethel finds Jimmy drinking for the first time.  Jimmy finally concedes; he can't help the others and they've taken Meep, who never really did anything to anybody, because he tried to get involved with Dell.  Jimmy decides he needs to come clean with the police to save Meep, but it's too late.  As he leaves the tent and heads outside, he's met with the headlights of a truck.  The passengers dump out a body rolled up in a tarp and he opens it as the vehicle drives away.  It's Meep's corpse. \n"}]}
