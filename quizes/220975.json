That film, about two men who redeemed themselves after a horrible tragedy brought them together, featured Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges.\r Depp did appear in Tim Burton's 1990 film 'Edward Scissorhands', and also was featured in Burton's 2005 film 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.  Depp played the character Roux in the 2000 film 'Chocolat'. \n"}, {"text": "Here's more Depp, for good measure!  Johnny Depp appeared in a 1994 film as a quirky director, with the film's title being that selfsame director's name.  What was the name of the director and the film?", "correct": "Ed Wood", "options": ["James Whale", "John Waters", "Roger Corman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEd Wood.\n\n\tYes, another film in which Depp and Burton collaborated, this time it was the 1994 biopic about the strange life of Hollyweird's weirdest director Ed Wood.  Depp was marvelous in this role alongside Martin Landau, who played the bizarre horror film actor Bela Lugosi. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' cast played a prominent role in the 2001 war drama 'Black Hawk Down'?", "correct": "Orlando Bloom", "options": ["Jack Davenport", "Geoffrey Rush", "Jonathan Pryce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOrlando Bloom.\n\n\tOne of Orlando Bloom's earliest film roles, he played Pfc. Todd Blackburn in the Ridley Scott-directed 'Black Hawk Down'.  He was featured alongside other up-and-coming actors such as Josh Hartnett and Eric Bana, and some wiley Hollywood veterans like Sam Shepard and Tom Sizemore. \n"}, {"text": "The very lovely Keira Knightley had a busy 2005, including an appearance in the lead role of which film adapted from a Jane Austen novel?", "correct": "Pride and Prejudice", "options": ["Northanger Abbey", "Sense and Sensibility", "Emma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPride and Prejudice.\n\n\tWe may know her better as Miss Elizabeth Swann in 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but in the 2005 version of 'Pride and Prejudice' she played another Elizabeth, namely Elizabeth Bennet.  Lizzy Bennet was one of five daughters in the Bennet family who were in search of a husband, the basis for the very popular story by Austen. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' cast won an Oscar for his or her work in the 1996 film 'Shine'?", "correct": "Geoffrey Rush", "options": ["Orlando Bloom", "Johnny Depp", "Keira Knightley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeoffrey Rush.\n\n\tAh yes, the inimitable Captain Barbossa who is of course, Mr. Rush. He has had many other roles besides the intimidating Captain.  His Oscar was quite surprising for 'Shine', considering that, at the time, Mr. Rush was quite unknown in the United States. \n"}, {"text": "We know Jack Davenport as Norrington from 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but Mr. Davenport has had other film successes.  His very first movie role was a small part in the 1997 quasi-sequel to the riotous comedy 'A Fish Called Wanda'.  What was it called?", "correct": "Fierce Creatures", "options": ["Subterrain", "The Wyvern Mystery", "Offending Angels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFierce Creatures.\n\n\tDavenport played a bit part as a student zookeeper in 'Fierce Creatures', not exactly a sequel to 'A Fish Called Wanda', since it only contained the same cast but as different characters.  'Fierce Creatures' featured a wacky plot about a zoo that does away with all animals except the 'fierce' ones in order to boost the zoo's profits.  You can just imagine how it proceeds from there. \n"}, {"text": "Which distinguished member of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' cast has had a number of roles in some of the greatest films of our era, including 'Glengarry Glen Ross', 'Brazil' and 'The Age of Innocence'?", "correct": "Jonathan Pryce", "options": ["Johnny Depp", "Geoffrey Rush", "Jack Davenport"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJonathan Pryce.\n\n\tJonathan Pryce, otherwise known as the kindly Governor Weatherby Swann from 'Pirates of the Caribbean', has been entertaining film audiences since the late 1970s.  Some of his standout roles include 'Brazil' (with Terry Gilliam) from 1985, 'Glengarry Glen Ross' from 1992 and 'The Age of Innocence' the following year. \n"}, {"text": "'Pirates of the Caribbean' castmates Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom both appeared in a 2003 biopic of the notorious outlaw 'Ned Kelly'.  In which country was this exciting film based?", "correct": "Australia", "options": ["South Africa", "Canada", "England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAustralia.\n\n\tNed Kelly was probably Australia's most famous historical outlaw, somewhat akin to Billy the Kid in the United States.  In that film, Heath Ledger played Ned Kelly, while Orlando Bloom was Kelly-gang member Joe Byrne. Geoffrey Rush portrayed Francis Hare, the man assigned to capture the Kelly gang. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, this is cheating a little bit, but the director Gore Verbinski deserves a mention here.  Which of these incredibly-filmed horror flicks was directed by Mr. Verbinski in 2002?", "correct": "The Ring", "options": ["Evil Dead II", "Saw", "The Night of the Living Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ring.\n\n\t'The Ring' is an adaptation of a Japanese horror story about a strange video tape that, when watched, spells doom for the person doing the viewing.  Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but the film actually worked, thanks to the excellent filmmaking of Verbinski and some spirited acting by the lovely Naomi Watts. \n"}, {"text": "Ah shucks, I can't resist another question about the beautiful Keira Knightley.  In 2002, which sports figure did she 'bend it like' in a sweet film directed by Gurinder Chadha?", "correct": "David Beckham", "options": ["Sachin Tendulkar", "Tiger Woods", "Serena Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDavid Beckham.\n\n\tThe year before hitting it big with 'Pirates of the Caribbean', Knightley starred in the surprise hit comedy 'Bend it Like Beckham' alongside Parminder Nagra and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. It was directed by Chadha ('Bride and Prejudice').  Knightley was a young English woman who convinced another young lady of Indian descent to join a soccer team despite her family's wishes that she do otherwise.\r I hope this quiz was as enjoyable for you to play as it was for me to make, thank you. \n"}]}
