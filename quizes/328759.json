Its reign lasted three non-consecutive weeks before The Monkees toppled it with \"I'm a Believer\".  Less than a year later, \"Winchester Cathedral\" won Best Contemporary Song at the Grammies.  The tune is typically performed by a full band with the vocalist singing through a megaphone.  Coincidentally, Frank Sinatra also covered the song.\r Looney_Tunes brought us this 1960s hit song! \n"}, {"text": "After \"Talk\" was released as a Coldplay single in late 2005, which of these lesser known songs by the popular British band appeared as a B-side on the same single release?", "correct": "Sleeping Sun", "options": ["Lhuna", "Things I Don't Understand", "How You See the World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSleeping Sun.\n\n\tAfter the release of the band's futuristic hit album \"X&Y\", Coldplay's fame rose through the roof.

John Williamson started his career in the 1970s while \"True Blue\" was released in the mid-eighties.  Clearly a country song, it's patriotic fare for the Aussies and one of the anthems of the country's national cricket team.  The same name would later be used for Williamson's first book and a number of his greatest hits albums.\r This authentic Australian fare was recommended by Muffy19. \n"}, {"text": "In 1939, Billie Holiday recorded a song about what things which hung from \"Southern trees\"?\n(Note: The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978.)", "correct": "Strange Fruit", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrange Fruit.\n\n\tA song clearly aimed against racism prevalent in the Southern States at this time, Billie Holiday's rendition of \"Strange Fruit\" is an eerie, poetic requiem for African-American men and women, victims of racism in America.  Originally the final song of her live performances, \"Strange Fruit\" became one of Holiday's top-selling records.  After being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978, \"Strange Fruit\" was added to the National Recording Registry in 2002.  Covered by numerous different artists, arguably none have been so chillingly beautiful as Holiday's blues/jazz version.\r \"Strange Fruit\" was recommended for our FunTrivia Setlist by Christinap. \n"}, {"text": "\"You better not kill the groove.\"\nIn what Sophie Ellis-Bextor song from her debut album would you find this line?", "correct": "Murder on the Dancefloor", "options": ["Music Gets the Best of Me", "Take Me Home", "Mixed Up World"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMurder on the Dancefloor.\n\n\tReleased as the second single from her first album, Sophie Ellis-Bextor's \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" was fairly successful reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart, the same as her previous single, \"Take Me Home\".

His first album (self-titled) reached number nineteen on the Billboard 200 chart while three different singles were released.  Of the incorrect choices, only 'Hey' appeared on the Billboard Hot 100.  \"Get Out\" appeared on the debut album but was never released as a single; his second album on the other hand released its first single in late 2010- its title was \"Get Away\".\r We received this entry from Salami_Swami! \n"}, {"text": "What popular song by Sandie Shaw won the Eurovision Song Contest for the UK (for the first time) in 1967?", "correct": "Puppet on a String", "options": ["Long Live Love", "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me", "Message Understood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPuppet on a String.\n\n\tHitting number one on the UK Singles Chart in 1967, \"Puppet on a String\" secured the UK's first Eurovision win, something that would happen again two years later when four countries tied for the lead position.  While notoriously Sandie Shaw claimed to dislike the song, it reached the top position in five different countries and became her third number one single.  Four decades later, Shaw would rerelease the song at a lower tempo.  Shaw is cited by many outlets as one of the most influential female British singers of the 1960s.  \"Puppet on a String\" was released on an album of the same name in 1967.\r This song was suggested as part of our setlist by Zorba_Scank. \n"}]}
