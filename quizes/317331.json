However, this ancestor is long-extinct. \n"}, {"text": "\"So now this whole rap thing seems awfully strange \nTalkin' 'bout, \"He got game, and he's not real \nAnd he's got chains\" but wait, that's a peacock's tail!\"\nFrom \"Hypnotize\"\n\nWhat, in these lyrics, does a \"peacock's tail\" signify?", "correct": "A costly item that the possessor used precious resources to acquire", "options": ["An item that makes the possessor look attractive but is unrelated to genetic fitness", "An item that is a hindrance to genetic success because it is so unwieldy", "An item designed to fool others into thinking it is something valuable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA costly item that the possessor used precious resources to acquire.\n\n\tMany male animals put on extravagant displays in order to attract females- huge antlers or horns, elaborate nests, ornamental feathers, elaborate mating displays. These displays are extremely costly of an animal's precious energy resources. So why do they do it? Because a male that can afford to \"squander\" resources on enormous antlers or perfect plumage shows females that he has quality genes.\r \"'Cause you never hear them say they got it cheap on sale \rWhich means that bling is meant to represent \rHow much they really spent, and at the end of the day \rThat's the definition of a \"fitness display\" \rLike a bowerbird's nest, which takes hours of work \rAnd makes the females catch a powerful urge \rJust like a style of verse or an amazing flow \rBut it takes dedication and it takes a toll \r'Cause the best displays are unfakeable\" \n"}, {"text": "\"No I wasn't born in Ghana but Africa is my mama \n'Cause that's where my mama got her mitochondria\"\nFrom \"I'm a African\"\n\nWhat important genetic concept is being referenced here?", "correct": "The inheritance of mitochondrial DNA", "options": ["The role of mitochondria as energy factories in the cell", "The evolution of mitochondria from bacteria", "The prevalence of mitochondrial diseases"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe inheritance of mitochondrial DNA.\n\n\tMitochondria, the energy factories of the cell, have their own DNA, derived from their bacterial ancestors (mitochondria were once bacteria that were engulfed by cells and then became a symbiotic part of them.) Because the few mitochondria in sperm are lost after an egg is fertilized, mammals inherit their mitochondria only from their mothers.\r Analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows that, around 200-250,000 years ago, a female proto-human lived in East Africa who is the matrilineal ancestor of all humans alive on Earth today. She is called \"Mitochondrial Eve.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"If you're thinkin' the criminal mind is just vacant \nYou're mistaken, this is calculated risk takin' \nWe're livin' in a situation with a low \nLife-expectancy, and a major discrepancy \nBetween the haves and have-nots, and you wonder \nWhy the padlock on every cash box is smashed off\"\nFrom \"Survival of the Fittest\"\n\nWhat phenomenon does Baba explain with these lyrics?", "correct": "Why disadvantaged societies have high rates of crime and teen pregnancy", "options": ["Why believing in the theory of evolution leads to crime", "Why crime is always maladaptive", "Why criminals are smarter than other people"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhy disadvantaged societies have high rates of crime and teen pregnancy.\n\n\tEvolutionary psychology shows that both high crime rates and high pregnancy rates in disadvantaged societies are adaptive. \r If you live in a violent society with a short life span and are male, you have little to lose by committing crime and much to gain- access to resources and status. If you are female, having children at a very young age may be your only chance to have them. Thus, in order to address the true causes of these problems, we must address the inequities that spawn them.\r \"But if we really want to change the outcome \rThen maybe we should just start questioning how it's adaptive \rAnd the bottom line is that inequity and life \rExpectancy are the ultimate causes of crime \rAnd the results of crime; to me that's true \rThe two combine together in a feedback loop\" \n"}, {"text": "\"The mating mind uses lyrical signs, combined with wit \nAnd wordplay, conversation, humour and different narrative styles \nTo appraise the fitness of mates, both for the purpose of marriage ties \nAnd for mates of the more temporary kind \nThese are the humble roots of the literary sublime.\"\nFrom \"Sexual Selection\"\n\nThe evolution of what phenomenon is being explained here?", "correct": "Language", "options": ["Music", "Marriage", "Flirting"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLanguage.\n\n\tLanguage may have evolved as a tool for mate selection, just as birdsong did.

Why would an animal risk itself to benefit another? In most cases, altruism is due to kin selection- if you do a good act for a relative, you increase the chances of the survival of genes that both you and that relative share, even if your chances for reproduction are lessened. But what about situations like vampire bats, where one bat will offer food to another, unrelated bat? This can be explained by reciprocal altruism- if I give you food today, you will be more likely to reciprocate and give me food tomorrow. \r \"And you don't have to reciprocate either \rBecause karma is a sophisticated teacher \rKarma isn't just energy waves in the ether! \rNo, karma's in the way everyone hates a cheater \rCheater detection will keep you in check when \rYou jump cues and refuse to treat people respectfully\" \n"}, {"text": "\"In 1859 Darwin spilled the first splashes \nOf his universal acid, and the effects were like magic \nBurning human arrogance into ashes \nIn exactly the same way that Copernican math did\"\nFrom \"Darwin's Acid\"\n\nWhat aspect did Copernican math and Darwin's theories share?", "correct": "They went against church orthodoxy", "options": ["They were purely theoretical and not supported by evidence", "They were not supported by science", "They are no longer viewed as valid today"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey went against church orthodoxy.\n\n\tDarwin's demonstration that all organisms are related through common descent- that humans are not \"specially created\"- and Copernicus's demonstration that the Earth revolves around the Sun and is not the center of the universe both violated centuries of Christian theology. \r \"The acid burns into the superstitious side \rOf the human mind, and fills it with light \rIt even dissolves the original sin of pride \rThe pride that says: \"I'm a special creation \rAnd my creator has given me dominion over nature \rAnd he has the power to replenish his creatures \rSo if species go extinct, he can recreate them later \rAnd if he doesn't, well that's just part of his plan\"\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Still, \"survival of the fittest\" is a phrase easily twisted \nBy anybody out to justify the meager existence \nThat some people live with; it's a phrase often enlisted \nBy parasites eager to benefit from these differences\"\nFrom \"Group Selection\"\n\nWhat is the perversion of evolutionary theory to defend human atrocities called?", "correct": "Social Darwinism", "options": ["Evolutionary justification", "Evolutionary reactionism", "Darwinistic psychology"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSocial Darwinism.\n\n\tMany people have attempted to use Darwin's theories to justify atrocities.\r \"In the nineteenth century it was aristocratic eugenicists \rIn the twentieth century, genocidal menaces \rUsed \"survival of the fittest\" to justify their death sentences \rAnd gangsters still use it today to degrade their victims \rNot to mention the purveyors of disaster capitalism\rThese are all examples of \"Social Darwinism\" \rBut none of this is based on scientific evidence \rMerely showing that something exists in a state of nature \rDoesn't give it a moral basis; that's a false correlation\"\r This last is important to realize.
