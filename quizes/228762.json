Instead, a deadly virus escapes from an animal testing facility in the U.K. and turns people into bloodthirsty killing machines.  Which movie is this?", "correct": "28 Days Later", "options": ["31 Days Later", "29 Days Later", "30 Days Later"], "explanation": "\n\n\n28 Days Later.\n\n\tIn this movie, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up alone in an empty hospital 28 days after getting into an accident, during his job as a bicycle courier, and finds London empty.  When he begins to find survivors, they band together in order to find a safe place, but soon, they begin joining the destructive infected humans when they too get infected by their blood.  When they come across the army, they think they're safe, but things get much worse when they encounter uninfected monsters.  \"28 Days Later\" put zombie thrillers back on the map in 2002, and it was a great, creepy film. \n"}, {"text": "(1968) This movie began generations of zombie movies when it was first released.  In this classic tale of the undead rising from their graves, a group of humans board themselves up in a house and search for a way to survive.  What is the name of this movie that put George A. Romero's name on the horror movie map?", "correct": "Night of the Living Dead", "options": ["Dawn of the Living Dead", "Day of the Living Dead", "Land of the Living Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Living Dead.\n\n\tIn this black and white film released in 1968, a satellite from Venus brought radiation to Earth and caused the dead to rise from the grave (just in time to meet Barbara and her brother at the graveyard), and soon people fled for their lives.  One group of people began to hide in an empty farmhouse by boarding up all windows and doors on the main floor, but soon, they couldn't escape the terror.  With one of their own wounded, and a few failed attempts at escaping, the zombies began to enter the house, and terror ensued.  This film spawned many sequels, and was remade in 1990. \n"}, {"text": "(2002) Alice certainly fell down the rabbit hole with this one.  In this zombie film, a research lab owned by the Umbrella Corporation called \"The Hive\" is placed into quarantine when a deadly strain of a virus is unleashed.  Soon, a military unit (along with Alice and a few other characters) enters the facility to shut down the computer, \"The Red Queen\".  Did I mention that Alice is suffering from amnesia?  What movie is this?", "correct": "Resident Evil", "options": ["The Hive", "Biohazard", "Dead Alive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResident Evil.\n\n\tThis movie is based on the hit video game series \"Resident Evil\" (known as \"Biohazard\" in Japan\") although none of these ever featured Alice as a main character.  In this movie, Alice is trying to figure out how she is involved with a company like the Umbrella Corporation, while she navigates the corridors with a military unit on the way to the \"Red Queen\".  When they shut off this computer, all of the doors in the factory are unlocked, and Hell breaks loose. To escape the labs and offices, the group must confront the infected humans, dogs, and mutated creatures along the way. In the end, one of the main characters becomes infected with a mutant strain of the virus, causing him to become Umbrella's new experiment. \n"}, {"text": "(2004) Okay, so maybe this isn't too much of a horror movie, but it's been described as 'a romantic comedy with zombies'.  In this movie, a man tries to get back together with his girlfriend, but he, his mother, his best friend, and others, must also defend themselves from zombies.  In this British comedy, anything goes; in fact, the main character frequently uses a cricket bat as a weapon.  What's the name of this movie?", "correct": "Shaun of the Dead", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nShaun of the Dead.\n\n\tThis movie was well-made, even for a romantic comedy.  It certainly wasn't too romantic after all, there were more zombies than anything.  In this movie, the main character, Shaun, breaks up with his girlfriend, so he and his buddy, Ed, get drunk and forget about it.  Shortly after, they realize that their neighbourhood has been plagued by the living dead, and they must save the ones they love.  With all of the blood and gore you'd expect from a zombie movie, you'd never know this film was filled to the brim with laughs and gags. \n"}, {"text": "(2003) Like many other films in this genre, this movie is based on a well-known video game.  Although this movie is based on an arcade game, it's not quite the same.  The plot is based around college-aged victims at a rave on a seemingly-deserted island, but they get killed by the local undead natives.  Which movie is this?", "correct": "House of the Dead", "options": ["The Island Dead", "Zombies Ate My Neighbors", "The Land of the Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHouse of the Dead.\n\n\tOkay, some parts of this movie really have nothing to do with anything and really, the only parts that reflect the video game are parts during the fight scenes that are meant to look like they come straight from the game.  Nevertheless, the game featurs many undead creatures and other mutant freaks, as a band of friends and partners attempt to escape with their lives.  In the end, only a few make it out (as usual), and escape in a helicopter.  There are also many little tidbits in the movie for fans of the game (like a Sega logo).\r\"Zombies Ate My Neighbors\" was a Sega/SNES game released many years prior to this movie.  It also featured zombies (obviously). \n"}, {"text": "(2004) In 1978, George A. Romero released a movie about a group of strangers gathering in a shopping mall in order to wait to be rescued from a horrible zombie plague.  The 2004 remake has the same name.  What is this movie?", "correct": "Dawn of the Dead", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDawn of the Dead.\n\n\tOverall, the remake of this movie is quite well done.  As a densely populated town starts to become overrun with zombies, people band together to save themselves.  Soon, the group of more than ten people (and one dog) are trapped in a shopping mall, a seemingly safe haven, and they spend their days waiting for their rescuers.  When their rescuers don't come, they plan their escape across the destroyed city. \n"}, {"text": "(1992) This movie is great because it shows that you can't escape zombies back in time.  In the \"Evil Dead\" movies, Ash somehow manages to travel back in time.  What is the name of the third movie in this trilogy?", "correct": "Army of Darkness", "options": ["The Evilest Dead", "Knight of the Living Dead", "Medi-Evil Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmy of Darkness.\n\n\tIn this movie, Ash is in medieval times with a car, shotgun, and chainsaw, and he needs to recover the Necronomicon in order to be taken back to present day.  When he finally obtains the book, he accidentally awakens the local corpses.  Soon, he's forced to battle the evil army of darkness, led by an evil double of himself.  The previous two movies in this trilogy were also about the undead, but they were set in present times. \n"}, {"text": "(1982) In this Stephen King film, there's a short vignette called \"Father's Day\", which involves a father rising from the grave.  Once again, George A. Romero is involved.  What is the name of this movie?", "correct": "Creepshow", "options": ["Dreamcatcher", "Pet Sematary", "Needful Things"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCreepshow.\n\n\t\"Creepshow\" involves five vignettes, starring famous faces such as Leslie Nielsen, Ed Harris, Ted Danson, and Stephen King himself.  The first vignette, \"Father's Day\", involves a father rising from the grave on Father's Day to get back at his family who share his fortunes.  \"Pet Sematary\" is another Stephen King movie involving the undead, but it isn't completely about zombies. The movie is about a man whose son is killed by a semi-truck, so he places him into an ancient Indian burial ground known for bringing corpses back to life.  Terror ensues when household pets and undead sons return from the grave. This movie also spawned a sequel. \n"}, {"text": "(1980) This famous John Carpenter film is about a fishing village called Antonio Bay during its centennial, when the villagers are terrorized by undead sailors.  This movie was remade in 2005.  What is its name?", "correct": "The Fog", "options": ["The Smoke", "The Mist", "The Smog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fog.\n\n\t\"The Fog\" was made by John Carpenter, who is famous for other horror films such as \"The Thing\" and \"Halloween\".  Both \"The Fog\" and \"Halloween\" star Jamie Lee Curtis.  This movie was remade in 2005 with famous celebrities like Tom Welling (\"Smallville\"), Maggie Grace (\"LOST\"), and Selma Blair (\"A Guy Thing\").  Although the remake was found to be disappointing, and was put down by critics, the original is still as great as ever. \n"}, {"text": "(2003) This Australian zombie movie is certainly interesting.  It begins in the town of Berkley, when meteors begin crashing to Earth and turning people to zombies when they're hit.  Soon, a couple of cops, a pregnant woman, her husband, a local beauty queen, and a gun shop owner must protect themselves from zombies, a mysterious wall blocking their way out of the region, odd acid rain, and an alien invasion (which may not be all that it seems).  What is this movie called?", "correct": "Undead", "options": ["Infection", "Zombie", "From the Grave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUndead.\n\n\tThis movie is hilarious, and it's obviously done by fans of the 'Zombie Horror' genre.  This film is filled with plenty of zombie action and gruesome zombie destruction.  The whole movie is set in a small Australian fishing village, and in the end, it is discovered that some hooded figures have been creating acid rain and 'healing' people from the horrible zombie disease.  In the end, one of the gang manages to fly over a large quarantine barrier, and once again infect many residents in the town, just after they have been saved.  The aliens never returned. \n"}]}
