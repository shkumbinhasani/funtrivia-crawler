{"id": "351227", "name": "Apples, Bananas, Cherries Quiz / Test | Fruit and Vegetables | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Hobbies Trivia", "Fruit and Vegetables", "Fruit Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "I have two Granny Smiths, three bananas, and a Maraschino.\n\nHow many apples do I have?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["One", "Three", "None"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tThe only apples of the bunch are the Granny Smiths-- they're green apples known for being used in apple pies worldwide.  Yes, they were first grown by a woman named Granny Smith.\r As for the rest of the fruits, I have three bananas (obviously they're not apples) and I have one Maraschino.  That's a cherry.\r Let's check out some more fruits. \n"}, {"text": "You open your basket to find four McIntoshes, four Lady Fingers, and four Bings.\n\nHow many cherries are in the basket?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Eight", "None", "Twelve"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tReally, the only cherries in the basket are the Bings.  Bing cherries are found in the United States and are known for being very red and very sweet.  First cultivated in Oregon, the fruit was named after a Chinese man who worked in an orchard.\r As for the rest of them, Lady Fingers are sweet and small bananas from Southeast Asia.  McIntoshes are well-known as red apples from North America; they were first cultivated in Ontario and are known for being the go-to apple of a certain computer company. \n"}, {"text": "If you look into the cupboard you'll find seven apples; three are red and four are green.  You'll also find a Montmorency and two Red Daccas.\n\nYou want to take the bananas.  Which of the following statements would be true?", "correct": "You can place a banana in each hand", "options": ["You can only place a single banana in one hand", "You don't have enough hands to carry all of the bananas", "There are no bananas in the cupboard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou can place a banana in each hand.\n\n\tThe only items you'll be taking out of the cupboard are the two Red Daccas.  Both are bananas grown primarily in Central America and parts of Asia though they are eaten in several regions of the world.  They're known for having a red skin and are also known as 'Cuban Red Bananas' (though they're not only grown in Cuba).\r The apples were a red herring-- not a red banana (or two).  The Montmorecy was nothing more than a single cherry.  You could find them growing in North America and their original country, France. \n"}, {"text": "You decide to unpack a bag of groceries from the market.  You find a bundle of four Plantains and a half-dozen of Golden Delicious in a clear bag.\n\nWhere are the apples?", "correct": "In the clear bag; there are six", "options": ["Everything in the bag is an apple; there are ten", "In the bundle; there are four", "At the store; there are none here"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the clear bag; there are six.\n\n\tGolden Delicious are sweet apples originally cultivated in the United States.  Having a half-dozen of them would mean you're well on your way to making a good apple sauce.  Aside from being a state fruit (in West Virginia), the Golden Delicious is also distinctive because it's yellow, as its name leads one to believe.\r Plantains are smaller, sweeter fruits from the banana family grown in Africa and Asia.  Some people opt to slice them, fry them, and make chips or use their leaves for many different purposes.\r Why didn't you buy some cherries? \n"}, {"text": "Next time you go to the store you're asked to pick up nine Blue Javas, three Galas, six Angelas, and six Concords.\n\nThis means that you need to head home with how many bananas?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Fifteen", "Twenty-one", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tThe only bananas you need to get are the Blue Javas, a very smooth banana originally from Asia and Oceania.  This particular banana is also found in Hawaii and the continental U.S. and, because of its taste, texture, and tolerance for cold weather, it's referred to as the Ice Cream Banana in some places.  It takes six months to grow an Ice Cream Banana.\r As for the rest of the fruits, you need three Galas (fairly popular, red apples) as well as six Angela Cherries (a sweet, black cherry).  As for the six Concords, those are purple grapes.  You shouldn't be adding them to the totals.  In fact, with all the apples, bananas, and cherries, it's probably overkill. \n"}, {"text": "You receive a fruit basket as a gift and inside you find seven Paula Reds, three Ginger Golds, four Nectarines, and a dozen Nankings.\n\nYou're an apple lover and immediately note that the basket contains how many apples?", "correct": "Ten", "options": ["Twenty-six", "Seven", "Fifteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTen.\n\n\tThere are two apple types this time around.  The Paula Red is a variation of the McIntosh apple found in the United States, grown later in the year, but similar otherwise due to their sharing many of the same genes.  The other apple in the basket would be the Ginger Gold, an apple discovered in Virginia in the wake of a hurricane which, according to farmers, planted a variation of earlier seeds, mutating into a yellow apple.  It's one of the earliest apples to ripen all year.\r Nectarines are similar to peaches and fall into said family-- they're not an apple.  Imagine a peach without the fuzz.  Nankings, on the other hand, are cherries found on Nanking trees in Asia.  While not typically cultivated for sale in most other regions of the world, they are edible. \n"}, {"text": "Sitting down on a park bench you notice a man across the path eating a single Cripps Pink.\n\nWhat exactly is he eating?", "correct": "Apple", "options": ["Banana", "None of these-- it's a plum", "Cherry"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApple.\n\n\tFor the first time in recent days you've come across a single fruit.  The Cripps Pink is a red/green apple grown in Europe (the Mediterranean) and Australia and is known to many as a Pink Lady apple.  Created from the genes of a Golden Delicious crossed with a Lady Williams, the Cripps Pink is very difficult to cultivate because the slightest difference in temperature, especially since the apple grows in the later months, can alter the colour, tartness, and crispiness of the fruit. \n"}, {"text": "You find a bag of fruit in your kitchen (how it got there is of no relevance...at least until you finish the quiz).  Inside you see three Grand Nains, a Rhino Horn, two Flowers of Kent and four Griottes de Kleparow.\n\nIf you add up how many bananas and how many cherries you've got in the mystery bag, what number do you get?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Seven", "Ten", "Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tThe only products in the bag that aren't bananas or cherries are the Flower of Kent apples.  These apples are hard to come by as their trees have slowly been driven to extinction.  They will, however, always remain famous as the cultivar of apple that fell on Sir Isaac Newton and spurned the notion of gravity.\r Both the Rhino Horn and the Grand Nain are bananas.  The former is the largest banana in the world (and it's grown in Africa).  Grand Nain are the famous Chiquita bananas; they're grown all around the globe, usually in equatorial climates.  Griotte de Kleparow is a type of sour cherry originally harvested in Eastern Europe. \n"}, {"text": "In your lunch box you have one Bramley, one Saba, a Roxbury Russett, two James Grieves, and four Gros Michel.\n\nWhich fruit do you have the most of?", "correct": "Bananas", "options": ["Cherries", "Apples", "You have equal amounts of all three fruits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBananas.\n\n\tYou happen to have brought four apples and five bananas on your lunch.  Here's why:\r A Bramley is a cooked red and green apple originally from the UK (but now found worldwide).  The Roxbury Russett is a light green apple and allegedly one of the oldest in North America.  Finally, the James Grieve is a juicy red apple found in Europe (though it's quite soft).  There are four apples in total.\r As for the bananas, the Saba is a fruit from the Philippines normally used in cooked dishes while the Gros Michel, grown in the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, is one of the most-heavily exported bananas in the world.  You have five bananas.\r You didn't pack any cherries.  What a shame. \n"}, {"text": "Across your epicurean ventures you've discovered that you know a bit much about fruits.  You decide that to keep it simple you only want to buy green things for a change.\n\nIs it possible to purchase green apples, green bananas, and green cherries?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tGreen is one of the most common colours of apple you can find (others include red, yellow, and pink).  The Granny Smith, for instance, is a green apple.\r Bananas can also be bought green but you wouldn't want to eat one.  A banana with a green peel indicates that it's not yet ripe.  Nonetheless, many markets will sell them while they're green so that the customer can be ensured of their inevitable ripeness.\r Finally, cherries (while typically red) can also be bought green though these are not typically fresh.  Maraschino cherries can often be bought and altered with flavouring for drinks.  This will turn them green.\r In other words, you could have your favourite three fruits in festive greens or reds! \n"}]}
