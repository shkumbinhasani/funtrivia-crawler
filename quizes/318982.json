{"id": "318982", "name": "Couches and the Potatoes That Inhabit Them Quiz | Entertainment | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes"], "questions": [{"text": "A couch potato is someone who likes to sit in comfort while going about their business (which is usually the viewing of a movie or a TV show). The couch is not essential, of course: any piece of comfy furniture will do. A case in point is Archie Bunker, who ruled his sitcom roost from an overstuffed armchair. In what TV show did Archie appear?", "correct": "All in the Family", "options": ["Family Ties", "Family Matters", "Friends"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll in the Family.\n\n\t\"All in the Family\", an American take on the British show \"Till Death Us Do Part\", ran on CBS from 1971 to 1979; after that, it ran under the name \"Archie Bunker's Place\" until 1983. The show was dominated by the character of Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor), a deeply bigoted white man who clashed with his submissive wife, his mediator daughter, his liberal son-in-law, his black neighbors, and just about everyone else he met.Though it grappled with some serious issues, the comedy was a huge success: not only did it spin off several other successful shows (most notably \"The Jeffersons\"), but Archie Bunker's chair is also enshrined in the Smithsonian Museum of American History! The couch has become a historical artifact -- and it only gets better from here. \n"}, {"text": "Couch-potato culture has everything: not just TV and movies, but also distinctive music. I've got the song \"Couch Potato\" queued up so you can hear it. It's a spoof of Eminem's hit \"Lose Yourself,\" performed by what popular American song parodist?", "correct": "\"Weird Al\" Yankovic", "options": ["Jonathan Coulton", "Tiny Tim", "Andy Stewart"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.\n\n\t\"Weird Al\" Yankovic has released well over a dozen music albums, each including several parodies of contemporary popular songs. He sings these pieces in the style of the original performer, often rhyming closely with the original lyrics; in fact, \"Weird Al\"'s parody can usually be played over the \"real\" music video to humorous effect.\r The 2003 parody song \"Couch Potato\" may be unavailable as a single (due to Eminem's lack of cooperation), but its lyrics still resonate with the proud couch potato community. I always dance when I hear the chorus:\r \"'You're gonna lose your mind watchin' TV,'\rThey told me, they'd scold me,\rBut I'd still tune in every show...\" \n"}, {"text": "The joys of a couch-potato lifestyle can bring a family together -- and, in one Fox sitcom, these joys were just about the only thing a husband and wife had going for them. Al Bundy identified with the sitcom character \"Psycho Dad,\" and Peggy Bundy's life revolved around the Shop at Home Network. Which TV show featured this dysfunctional couple?", "correct": "Married ... with Children", "options": ["King of Queens", "Happy Days", "Desperate Housewives"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarried ... with Children\n\n\tAl (Ed O'Neill) and Peggy (Katey Sagal) Bundy didn't have much tying them together over the course of the show's 1987-1997 run. They shared a taste for casual cruelty, toward each other and toward their two teenage children, and TV was an important way for them to access those emotions. The \"Psycho Dad\" show-within-a-show helped Al focus his resentment of his family, and Peggy's devotion to shopping channels helped her spend the money her husband brought home. All right, maybe \"helped\" is too strong a word for these two. \n"}, {"text": "Couch potatoes may appear unconcerned with the world around them, but an angry couch potato is a force to be reckoned with. One 1998 movie with a devoted cult following makes this clear. It tells the story of a man called the Dude, whose peaceful life was interrupted by a gang of thieves who spoiled his rug. While trying to regain his sedentary lifestyle, the Dude untangled multiple plots involving mistaken identity, kidnapping, and embezzlement. What is the name of this film, which starred Jeff Bridges and John Goodman?", "correct": "The Big Lebowski", "options": ["Raising Arizona", "High School High", "Dumb and Dumber"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Big Lebowski.\n\n\tThere were two Jeffrey Lebowskis in the picture: the Dude (Jeff Bridges), who just wanted his couch-potato life back, and the \"big\" Lebowski (David Huddleston), a wealthy paraplegic. The whole mess started when the thieves mistook the Dude for his richer counterpart, and the Dude was gradually drawn in for higher and higher stakes. It was a puzzle for which his life of television and bowling had hardly prepared him, but his blowhard friend Walter (John Goodman) was convinced they could save the day. \n"}, {"text": "Many couch potatoes are most \"active\" during sports broadcasts. Having spent years watching these events from the comfort of their living rooms, some have even come to be very knowledgeable about them, and can be identified by their loud complaints that the players, coach, etc., are doing it all wrong. What is the American term for this strident group of sports-loving couch potatoes?", "correct": "Armchair quarterbacks", "options": ["Sofa shortstops", "Couch coaches", "Futon fullbacks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmchair quarterbacks.\n\n\tThe term \"armchair quarterbacks\" describes fans who believe they could conduct a game better than the people who are paid to do it -- and all without leaving their cozy upholstered furniture. (Sadly, in many cities your guide has lived in, the armchair quarterbacks have been right!) A quarterback is a position in American football that often requires both quick and strategic thinking to direct the course of the game; thus, this is an easy position to second-guess.\r Armchair quarterbacks have a close cousin in the armchair general, a type of couch potato more inclined to military history. \n"}, {"text": "If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to one of the couch potato's famous relatives: the mouse potato. This particular mouse potato spends her time at the computer, playing a wildly popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in a high-fantasy universe. If she's just leveled her Tauren druid or Draenei alt, she'll be in a good mood. What game, which unfolds in the world of Azeroth, is she playing?", "correct": "World of Warcraft", "options": ["Halo 2", "The Sims", "Super Mario Kart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft.\n\n\t\"World of Warcraft\" was released by Blizzard Entertainment in 2004, and there has since been a marked increase in the mouse potato population. (There were nearly 12 million subscribing players by the end of 2008.) The mouse potato sits at a computer, tapping the keyboard and clicking the mouse to control a high-fantasy character such as a night elf warrior or a troll mage.Although it may not be obvious at first glance, these are highly social games whose characters interact with each other regularly on the company's servers. They cooperate on quests, trade goods and armor on chat channels, and even kill each other's characters in battles for resources.Perhaps that last one is more anti-social... \n"}, {"text": "You may be wondering how couch potatoes survive, but in fact there are many ways to use our skills -- like game shows! You may laugh, but in 1989 there really was a direct-to-syndication game show called \"Couch Potatoes\" on American television. What type of trivia were contestants expected to know?", "correct": "Television trivia", "options": ["Furniture trivia", "General knowledge", "Video-game trivia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelevision trivia.\n\n\tHosted by Marc Summers (who also hosted \"Double Dare\" at around the same time), \"Couch Potatoes\" pitted two teams against each other in several rounds. The question formats and names were innovative -- anyone could try their luck at a Tune-In question, which would be followed by three Spin-Off questions on the same show. The sums weren't large by game-show standards, but $1000 will buy a nice couch! \n"}, {"text": "Let's meet a few more couch potatoes. We'll head deep into the newspaper comics to find one of the more unusual specimens: this one isn't even human! What cartoon tabby has a reputation for incredible laziness, as well as incredible love for lasagna?", "correct": "Garfield", "options": ["Bucky Katt", "Mr. Bigglesworth", "Hobbes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarfield.\n\n\tGarfield, an orange tabby cat owned by the hapless Jon Arbuckle, is the star of Jim Davis's hit comic strip \"Garfield.\" Launched in 1978, the strip mines classic material for jokes: Garfield's favorite deadly sins (sloth and gluttony), Jon's disastrous lovelife, and the dog Odie's naive stupidity. Garfield himself has \"starred\" in numerous movies, television shows, and lines of plush toys, but he is still a proud couch potato despite this busy life.One early strip (August 4, 1978) showed him sprawled in an armchair in front of the television, making a classic complaint: \"I hate television commercials.They're too long to sit through -- and they're too short for a trip to the sandbox!\" \n"}, {"text": "For our next field trip, we'll follow the animated world's most famous couch potato. He's wrapped up a long day of naps at the nuclear power plant, which (for some reason) pays him for this, and is returning to his home at 742 Evergreen Terrace. There, he will open a Duff beer, plop down on a pink sofa, and watch television instead of paying attention to either his wife or his children. Who is this donut-loving couch potato?", "correct": "Homer Simpson", "options": ["Hank Hill", "Krusty the Klown", "Shaggy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer Simpson.\n\n\tBeginning in 1989, the television show \"The Simpsons\" broadcast Homer's exploits to the world, as well as the misadventures of his family. A proud and devoted couch potato, Homer spends much of his screen time ignoring or dismissing the needs of his wife (Marge) and children (Bart, Lisa, and Maggie) in favor of television, beer, donuts, or all three. Nonetheless, like many couch potatoes, Homer does have strong social bonds with friends and family, and usually comes through when he needs to -- even when the pull of the couch is strong. \n"}, {"text": "What might the future hold for couch-potato culture? A 2006 movie by Mike Judge gives one possible answer to that question. The film shows how, 500 years in the future, couch-potato technology has been raised to an art form -- but other vital things, such as the knowledge that plants should be irrigated with water rather than with sports drinks, have been lost. What is the name of this movie, which starred Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph?", "correct": "Idiocracy", "options": ["Wall-E", "District 9", "On the Couch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIdiocracy.\n\n\tIn \"Idiocracy,\" two average Americans (Wilson and Rudolph) go into suspended animation for a brief military experiment and are accidentally left asleep for 500 years. They wake up to find that humanity has effectively bred itself to be dumber and dumber, and civilization is on the verge of collapse because no one knows how to run it. Luckily, the two average Joes from the past -- now the smartest people on the planet -- have awakened just in time to take control and put things back on course.Everyone else is free to enjoy their cutting-edge couches, which include built-in toilet facilities. All right, maybe that's a step too far. \n"}]}
