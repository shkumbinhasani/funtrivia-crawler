Fourteen years later, Linda Ronstadt covered the song, and it became her signature song.

Elvis Presley is the most well-known singer of this song.\r Another Elvis song, \"Blue Hawaii\", was the title track of the same name from his album, which again was the soundtrack to his movie \"Blue Hawaii\".\r \"Mr. Blue Sky\", written by Jeff Lynne (frontman for ELO), came about when Lynne sequestered himself in a Swiss chalet, trying to write songs for ELO's next album.

In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a \"purplish haze\" which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants.\r \"The Purple People Eater\" is the story of a strange creature (a \"one-eyed, one-horned, flying, purple people eater\") who lands on Earth to be in a rock 'n' roll band.

With the ceiling flying away and room humming harder, I wanted to paint an image of a scene. I wasn't trying to be mysterious with those images, I was trying to be evocative. I suppose it seems like a decadent scene I'm describing. But I was too young to have experienced any decadence, then. I might have been smoking when I conceived it, but not when I wrote. It was influenced by books, not drugs.\"\r Songwriter and satirist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic wrote \"White and Nerdy\" as a parody of \"Ridin'\" by Chamillionaire and Krayzie Bone.  It's both a satire and praising of nerd culture.\r \"Dirty White Boy\" is the first song released from Foreigner's \"Head Games\" album.  Co-writer Mick Jones said the song is about Elvis Presley; quote: \"he always was that dirty white boy who changed the shape of music completely.

Elvis paved the way for all that.\" \n"}, {"text": "What color is missing from these song titles?\nHawthorne Heights song:\n\"Blue Burns ____\"\n\nR.E.M. song:\n\"____ Crush\"\n\nTori Amos song:\n\"The Power of ____  Knickers\"", "correct": "orange", "options": ["green", "gold", "purple"], "explanation": "\n\n\norange.\n\n\tIn R.E.M.'s song \"Orange Crush\", the title refers to the chemical Agent Orange, which was used as a defoliant during the Vietnam war.

I took a taxi to the hotel and when I woke up the next morning, I threw back the curtains and saw these beautiful green mountains in the distance. Then, I looked down and there was a parking lot as far as the eye could see, and it broke my heart... this blight on paradise. That's when I sat down and wrote the song.\"\r Elton John's \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" uses imagery from the movie \"The Wizard of Oz\" (the first film Elton's writing partner Bernie Taupin remembers seeing). The lyrics create a metaphor that describe wanting to go back to a simpler existence after living what was thought to be the good life, but realizing he had simply been treated like a pet.\r Brian Hyland's novelty song \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\" came out after the introduction of the skimpy two-piece swimsuit.  The suit was considered quite risque.  The song tells the story of a woman who brings one to the beach, changes in to it, but then is too shy to be seen.  She is first scared to leave the locker room where she's changed, then she sits wrapped up on the beach, and finally goes into the water but won't leave it, despite developing slight hypothermia.  The song is credited with bringing acceptance to the revealing attire, and also to the surf culture of the 1960s, emphasized in movies and television. \n"}, {"text": "What color is missing from these song titles?\nJason Mraz song\n\"Geek in the ____\"\n\nBruce Springsteen song:\n\"____ Cadillac\"\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs song:\n\"Pretty in ____\"\n", "correct": "pink", "options": ["purple", "black", "green"], "explanation": "\n\n\npink.\n\n\tLike other artists before Springsteen, \"Pink Cadillac\" follows tradition of using automobile travel as a metaphor for sexual activity.

Songwriter Bill Janovitz attributes producer Steve Lillywhite for combining \"the ideal sound for the band, with a perfect blend of classic pop, punk, and art rock elements.\"  The 1986 movie was named after the song.  It was included on the movie's soundtrack, which has been rated as one of the best in modern cinema. \n"}]}
