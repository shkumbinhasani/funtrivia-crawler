She was the second-oldest of six daughters born to Prince William, who became Grand Duke Guillaume IV in 1905. \rWhen William died in 1912, his oldest daughter, Marie-Adelaide, became Grand Duchess. Her reign was soon interrupted when the German Empire violated Luxembourg's neutrality in August 1914. At the end of the war in 1918, though, the French government decided it was unable to have cordial relationships with Grand Duchess Marie-Adelaide because they perceived her as pro-German. The Luxembourg parliament called for her abdication and in January 1919 she relinquished her title in favor of her sister, Charlotte. \rCharlotte, who had spent the war exiled in London, took over as Grand Duchess just before her 23rd birthday. She ruled the Duchy for the next 45 years, although she spent World War II exiled in Portugal whilst the Duchy was occupied by Nazi Germany. \rCharlotte abdicated in November 1964 at the age of 68, allowing the oldest of her six children to take over as Grand Duke Jean.
