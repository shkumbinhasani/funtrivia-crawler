My personal favorite is the insertion of 'in his underwear' after 'Santa came to say', but I'm not sure why... \n"}, {"text": "In which Christmas hit of the 1980s is the line 'But say a prayer; Pray for the other ones' performed by George Michael?", "correct": "Do They Know It's Christmas?", "options": ["Another Lonely Christmas", "It's Christmas All over the World", "Last Christmas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDo They Know It's Christmas?.\n\n\tGeorge Michael's line was just one among many in this wonderful number one hit by 'Band Aid', a group of British rockers hoping to raise money for starving people in Africa.
