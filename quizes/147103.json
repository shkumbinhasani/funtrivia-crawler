{"id": "147103", "name": "'Dances With Wolves', Part 2 Quiz | Dances with Wolves . | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Dances with Wolves"], "questions": [{"text": "The first evening at Fort Sedgwick is a lonely and anxious experience for Lt. Dunbar.  He spends it writing in his diary and concocting a plan to clean the fort.  The following morning he is spooked by a noise he hears outside, but it's just his horse.  How does he admonish Cisco?", "correct": "Bad horse!  Bad horse!", "options": ["Run along little doggie!", "You're one crazy horse!", "Take a hike, Cisco!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBad horse!  Bad horse!.\n\n\tI must say, though a huge fan of the film, this is one of the least well-delivered lines in movie history.  I always get a chuckle at the dry way in which Costner scolds the horse, as if he's just phoning it in.  Costner's acting has never been extraordinary, but in this picture, aside from this moment, it's better than average. \n"}, {"text": "During the first morning, Dunbar assigns himself clean-up duty.  He finds the fort startlingly unkept, with debris strewn about the entire place.  In the small pond near the fort, what discarded item gives him a shock?", "correct": "A deer carcass", "options": ["An entire calistoga wagon", "A dead human body", "The food supplies of the former post"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA deer carcass.\n\n\tDunbar goes on to discover a number of deer carcasses in the pond (in the extended version...in the theater version we only see the one carcass).  He cannot understand why the dead deer are in the pond, nor can he understand why the men of the fort have been dwelling in mud caves.  He burns the deer carcasses, creating a huge plume of smoke. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar's former travelling companion, Timmons, on his return to Fort Hays, encounters several unfriendly Pawnee Indians.  The leader of this small band of Indians is played by a quite recognizable actor, having appeared in films such as 'The Last of the Mohicans' and 'Mystery Men'.  What is this actor's name?", "correct": "Wes Studi", "options": ["Michael Spears", "Rodney Grant", "John Tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWes Studi.\n\n\tWes Studi, a Vietnam veteran of Cherokee Indian descent, has appeared in several other memorable films, such as 'Heat', 'Geronimo: An American Legend' and 'The Doors' (as the Indian Jim Morrison meets in the desert).  In 'The Last of the Mohicans', Studi plays Magua, while in 'Mystery Men' he is the superhero called The Sphinx.  In 'Dances with Wolves' he is not given a name; he is just listed as 'Toughest Pawnee'. \n"}, {"text": "Timmons is able to fend off the Pawnee attack and return himself and his wagon to Fort Hays, where he informs the appropriate officials about the condition of Fort Sedgwick.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tTimmons is taken by surprise by the Pawnee attackers, who lay into him with several arrows.  He is left scalped and dying in the prairie, with his valuable supplies taken by the Indians.  His dying concern is for the well-being of his mules, which I found quite touching.  I read that the Pawnee Nation was quite annoyed by their portrayal in this film, by the way.  They felt as if their tribe was exploited as 'bad Indians' as compared to the 'good Indians', the Sioux. \n"}, {"text": "Back at Fort Sedgwick, Lt. Dunbar continues to straighten out the surrounding area.  On his way back to his dwelling, he espies a lone wolf, which he seems intent on shooting.  He decides, however, to spare the life of the canine with whom he soon develops a bond.  What does he decide to call his greyish-brown lupine friend?", "correct": "Two Socks", "options": ["White Paws", "Brown Fur", "Grey Tail"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo Socks.\n\n\tIf I may be so bold as to suggest, the name he selects is quite like what I would expect from a Native American.  Perhaps the message here is that Dunbar has a predilection towards Native Americans that preceeds even his first direct encounter with their culture.  Two Socks becomes a close friend to Dunbar, even taking meat directly from his hand after some gentle coaxing. \n"}, {"text": "Dunbar has been a month at Fort Sedgwick before his first encounter with an Indian.  What had the lieutenant been doing just prior to his first visual contact with an Indian who appears to be stealing his horse?", "correct": "Bathing", "options": ["Sleeping", "Reading", "Sewing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBathing.\n\n\tDunbar had been washing his clothing and taking a bath in the pond.  Returning to his cabin, he notices a single Indian apparently helping himself to Cisco.  The lieutenant very purposefully shouts 'You there', while swiftly approaching the horse corral fully nude.  Whether it be out of shock at the appearance of Dunbar, or fear of the sight of a nude Costner, the Indian runs to his horse and rides off in a flurry. \n"}, {"text": "This first Indian encounter is with a noble-looking middle-aged fellow played by actor Graham Greene.  What is the name of the character portrayed by Greene in 'Dances with Wolves'?", "correct": "Kicking Bird", "options": ["Ten Mules", "White Bull", "Stone Calf"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKicking Bird.\n\n\tGraham Greene is a very recognizable actor, especially for those of us who enjoy films about Native Americans and their culture.  He has appeared in such films as 'Thunderheart', 'North', 'Maverick' and 'Skins' (which I highly recommend).  The native Canadian actor, and member of the Oneida Indian tribe, was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar after his work in 'Dances with Wolves', but did not take home the prize. \n"}, {"text": "After this first significant encounter with an Indian, Dunbar responds in a very cautious manner.  He buries his excess ordnance in the nearby prairie, and hides the additional supplies he has brought.  What item does he use to mark the spot where he buried his rifles and ammunition?", "correct": "A bone", "options": ["A wooden stake", "A cross", "A tin can"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA bone.\n\n\tThis becomes very significant later in the film when Dunbar returns to the fort with the young man Smiles a Lot, looking for the rifles.  In the pouring rain, his young companion locates the bone, and they are able to return the rifles to the Sioux encampment where the Pawnees come to make war. \n"}, {"text": "Dumbar is not the only one alarmed by this first contact.  Back at the Sioux village, a tribal meeting is called to discuss the matter.  Various leaders of the tribe speak their mind on the topic, including a strong, young warrior who suggests that Dunbar be killed.  What is this brash fellow's name?", "correct": "Wind In His Hair", "options": ["Chasing His Horse", "Red Crow", "Builds the Fire"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWind In His Hair.\n\n\tWhile Kicking Bird suggests a diplomatic approach, Wind In His Hair, played by actor Rodney Grant, recommends that several warriors go to Fort Sedgwick and fill Dunbar with arrows.  The tribal leader, Ten Bears, decides that further deliberation is necessary before a decision is made on how to approach this delicate matter. \n"}, {"text": "The night of the tribal meeting, three young Sioux boys ride out to Fort Sedgwick and attempt to steal Dunbar's horse.  Their plan fails however when the horse escapes their capture and returns to the fort.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhile Dunbar sleeps, the three boys sneak into the corral and steal Cisco.  The lieutenant is awakened by the sound of the boys' horses running off and he leaps from his bed, grabbing his gun on the way up.  Unfortunately, he hits his head on the low doorframe and knocks himself out cold.  The boys fail to return Cisco to the Sioux camp, though...the horse is simply uncontrollable, and one of the boys broke his arm when he fell of his horse.
