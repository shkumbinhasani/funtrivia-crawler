It has land borders with Guinea to the north and northeast and with Liberia to the south and southeast. Senegal is further north along the coast, but does not share a border with Sierra Leone. \n"}, {"text": "With an area of 27,700 square miles, Sierra Leone is slightly larger than the US state of West Virginia. To which European Union member state is it of comparable size?", "correct": "Ireland", "options": ["Denmark", "Belgium", "Greece"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIreland.\n\n\tWith an area of 27,133 square miles, Ireland is only slightly smaller than Sierra Leone. Of the alternatives, Denmark (at 16,639 square miles) is barely more than half the size of Sierra Leone. Belgium (11,787 sq miles) is even smaller and would fit comfortably twice inside Sierra Leone. By contrast, Greece (at 50,960 sq miles) is almost big enough to hold Sierra Leone twice over. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is NOT a river that flows though Sierra Leone?", "correct": "Tano River", "options": ["Mano River", "Rokel River", "Great Scarcies River"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTano River.\n\n\tThe Mano River rises in Guinea and Liberia-Sierra Leone border before crossing the Kono and Kailahun District of Sierra Leone.

The Great Scarcies River rises in Guinea where it is called the Kolent\u00e9 River. It forms part of the border between Guinea and Sierra Leone before emptying into the Atlantic at Barlo Point. At 240 miles in length, the Rokel River is the longest in Sierra Leone. It rises in the Loma Mountains in eastern Sierra Leone and eventually joins the Sierra Leone River to form Freetown Harbor, the largest natural harbor on the African continent.\r The odd one out is the Tano River, which is a 400km-long river in West Africa, but it flows through Ghana and eventually forms the Ghana-Ivory Coast border before entering the Atlantic. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is NOT a region in Sierra Leone?", "correct": "Lowland Savannah", "options": ["Coastal Mangroves", "Upland Mountain Plateau", "Wooded Hill Country"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLowland Savannah.\n\n\tThe Guinean mangrove swamps is a coastal eco-region that stretches along the coast of West Africa from Senegal to Sierra Leone.

With more than 65 miles of beaches it is a prime tourist destination. A prime breeding ground for green and leatherback sea turtles, it is also popular with serious sports fishermen since the surrounding waters hold some of the biggest tarpon.\rOf the alternatives, Dublin Island is one of two inhabited islands in the Banana Islands which lie off the south coast of the Freetown Peninsular. Dublin Island is particularly renowned for its beaches. Bunce Island is located in the Sierra Leone River 20 miles upriver from Freetown. Only 1,650 feet by 350 feet, it was the site of an 18th-Century British slave castle. Tiwai Island, located in the Moi River in Southern Province, is a wildlife sanctuary and tourist destination covering about five square miles. \n"}, {"text": "Eastern Sierra Leone is a region of large plateaus and high mountains. Which of these peaks is Sierra Leone's highest?", "correct": "Mount Bintumani", "options": ["Adrar des Iforas", "Mount Nimba", "Mount Agou"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMount Bintumani.\n\n\tAt 6,391 feet, Mount Bintumani, which is also known as Loma Mansa, is Sierra Leone's highest point.

Krio is a Creole variation that is the most widely-spoken language in Sierra Leone, with more than 97% of the population able to speak it. Krio is the primary language spoken by Sierra Leonese at home. \rThe odd one out is Hausa, which is an Afro-Asiatic language spoken as a first language by around 35 million people in West Africa. One of the most widely-spoken languages throughout Africa, it is used widely in Niger, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Sudan and Togo, but not in Sierra Leone. \n"}, {"text": "Some 183 species of mammal can be found living in Sierra Leone, of which six are classed as endangered.

The Pygmy Hippopotamus is native to a small area of West Africa. mostly in Liberia with small populations in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. It is estimated that there are less than 3,000 remaining in the wild. The country's largest primate (other than man) is the Common Chimpanzee. Sierra Leone has about 2,000 Western Chimpanzees, the largest population anywhere other than neighboring Guinea.\r Other endangered species found in Sierra Leone include Baer's Wood Mouse, the Diana Monkey and the African Wild Dog.

Koinadugu in the extreme northeast is Sierra Leone's largest district -- at 4,680 square miles it is about the size of the Falkland Islands. Although it has almost 20% of the country's land area, it is home to less than 5% of the population, about 250,000 in the 2004 census. Its capital is Kabala. The Bombali District covers 3,083 sq miles (so just a little smaller than Cyprus) and is home to about 430,000 (2004 data). Its capital and largest city is Makeni. It is the birthplace of former President Joseph Saidu Momoh and of President Ernest Bai Koroma who was elected in 2007.
