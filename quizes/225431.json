{"id": "225431", "name": "Take this \"Super Mario RPG\" Bosses Quiz! Average Trivia | Mario Games", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario RPG"], "questions": [{"text": "During your first boss match, you'll fight Bowser in his lair.  You shouldn't actually attack Bowser.  Which inanimate object should you jump on?", "correct": "Kinklink", "options": ["Support", "Throne", "Piano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKinklink.\n\n\tIn the beginning of the game, Bowser will have kidnapped Princess Toadstool (again), so Mario heads to Bowser's Keep to save her.  When you reach the throne room, you need to fight Bowser on the chandeliers.  If you jump on the Kinklink a couple of times, it really won't matter if you hit Bowser at all.  Bowser will also hit your Kinklink, but you'll still manage to win the battle.  After this, Exor crashes into the castle and the real fun begins. \n"}, {"text": "How many Hammer Bros. do you fight on Mushroom Way?", "correct": "Two", "options": ["Four", "Three", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\tAt the very end of Mushroom Way, you'll need to save Toad from the Hammer Bros. who will be blocking the entrance to Mushroom Kingdom.  They will use two different moves, and when the first one is defeated, the second will use Vigor Up! to raise his defense.  Keep attacking them and you'll defeat them.  After the battle, Toad will hand you Mario's first equippable weapon, the Hammer, which one of the Hammer Bros. left behind after the fight. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Croco first fought in the game?", "correct": "Bandit's Way", "options": ["Mushroom Kingdom", "Moleville", "Bowser's Keep"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBandit's Way.\n\n\tCroco is the one responsible for stealing Mallow's coin in Mushroom Kingdom.  Mallow will join the party in order to retrieve the coin, and you'll need to chase him through Bandit's Way.  Once you defeat him, he'll appear again in Moleville Mines and you'll need to fight him for a Bambino Bomb.  The third time you meet him, he'll help you out by selling you items in Bowser's Keep.  In fact, Croco will sell you the most powerful buyable armor in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Which attack is Mack likely to use on you?", "correct": "Flame Wall", "options": ["S'Crow Dust", "Crystal", "Static E!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlame Wall.\n\n\tAfter you defeat Croco for the first time, you'll need to go to Mushroom Kingdom.  Once you arrive, you'll notice that the kingdom is under attack.  If you fight your way into the throne room, you'll fight Mack, an odd sword-like thing for the first star of the game.  He will use fire based attacks like Flame and Flame Wall, and if you're a high enough level, he should be pretty easy to beat.  You an also fight Mack a second time in the Factory at the end of the game. \n"}, {"text": "How many times must you defeat Belome throughout the game?", "correct": "Twice", "options": ["Four times", "Once", "Three times"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwice.\n\n\tThe first time you must fight Belome is in the Kero Sewers.  In order to escape the sewers and head to Tadpole Pond, you need to defeat Belome and flow with the Midas River.  During the first battle, Belome will like to turn party members into Scarecrows with S'Crow Dust and eat them to prevent them from taking a turn.  The second battle is in Belome Temple (go figure) in Land's End.  During the second battle, Belome can create clones of your party members that will attack you.  Belome also has the nasty habit of putting characters to sleep in the second battle. \n"}, {"text": "Defeating Bowyer earns the group another star.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter you arrive in Rose Town, you'll need to head into the Forest Maze to stop Bowyer.  When you arrive at Bowyer's clearing, Geno will already start fighting the boss, and when you arrive, Geno will join the party.  The battle with Bowyer is quite odd.  Bowser can temporarily disable certain buttons during battle, and can simply stop you from using items or certain attacks.  Bowyer also uses attacks like Crystal, and Static E! to do good damage to your party members.  After the battle, Geno joins the party, the second star is yours, and you head to Pipe Vault, Yo'Ster Island, and Moleville. \n"}, {"text": "As you make your way through Moleville Mines, you'll come across the third star.  What is the name of the boss that guards it?", "correct": "Punchinello", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPunchinello.\n\n\tPunchinello is a weird character.  To reach him, you need to basically go to the deepest part of the Moleville Mines (with the help of Croco's Bambino Bomb).  During the battle, Punchinello doesn't use many special attacks, but he'll frequently sent out different types of Bob-ombs.  As the battle progresses, the bombs he sends out will get larger and larger until finally, one crushes him.  After this bomb unexpectedly blows up, the star is yours and you can save Dyna and Mite. \n"}, {"text": "Which is an optional boss in Booster's Tower?", "correct": "Booster", "options": ["Croco", "Grate Guy", "Knife Guy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBooster.\n\n\tIf you lose horribly in the Curtains mini-game, you'll be thrown into a battle against Booster and his three Snifits.  Of course, if you flawlessly beat the Snifits and Booster at the mini-game, you'll get an Amulet for finding the Mario doll.  After this mini-game (or battle depending on how you did), you'll fight Knife Guy and Grate Guy on the balcony.  One will use Meteor Blast and the other will use Blizzard to attack all enemies at once.  Another odd attack used is Echofinder which will temporarily stop you from using special attacks.  After this battle, you'll head to Marrymore. \n"}, {"text": "During the boss battle in Marrymore's wedding chapel, who is the final enemy you face?", "correct": "Raspberry", "options": ["Chef Torte", "Apprentice", "Bundt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaspberry.\n\n\tWhen Mario brings Booster's wedding ceremony to a halt, the chef of the wedding cake will get furious.  He begins the battle alongside his apprentice since he feels that you should eat his cake, but when the cake starts to get a mind of its own, they leave.  During the first part of the cake's (Bundt's) battle, you'll need to extinguish its flames by hitting hit.  Onces its candles go out, it will transform into Raspberry.  When Raspberry loses enough health, Booster will eat it and put it out of its misery.  Watch out during the first half of the battle though, Bundt's candles can relight. \n"}, {"text": "The next boss is in the Sunken Ship.  How many tentacles does King Calimari have?", "correct": "Eight", "options": ["Seven", "Six", "Nine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEight.\n\n\tTo reach King Calimari, you need to solve the word puzzle in the bowels of the ship.  Input P-E-A-R-L-S in the boxes and go on to fight the leviathan.  During the battle, you'll begin by fighting two sets of three tentacles.  When these have been beaten, you fight the head and final two tentacles of the king.  The tentacles have the power to take a party member away for a few turns, and when they return they'll be frightened.  Once you defeat the King, you'll gain entry to the final half of the sunken ship. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss of the Sunken Ship?", "correct": "Johnny", "options": ["Jackie", "Jimmy", "Jolly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny.\n\n\tWhen you reach the captain's quarters of the sunken ship (which are obviously at the furthest-most point from the entrance), you'll be challenged by the captain, Johnny, for the fifth star.  You'll have to defeat him and his Bandana side-kicks to finish the match, but about half-way through, Johnny may demand a one-on-one battle (this is optional though).  At this point, he will also power up his attack and defense.  After the battle, Johnny will hand over the star and you can take it back to Seaside Town. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss in Seaside Town?", "correct": "Yaridovich", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nYaridovich.\n\n\tWhen you arrive in Seaside Town with the fifth star, the 'Elder' will steal it from you and run off to be picked up by Blade, Smithy's servant.  Chase him down and you'll fight Yaridovich.  During the battle, Yaridovich has some unfriendly moves like Water Blast which can severely damage your party.  Throughout the battle, Yaridovich can also split in two and you'll need to determine which is the real one by attacking them.  After the battle, you'll get the star back, and you'll free the real citizens of Seaside Town from their impenetrable shed prison. \n"}, {"text": "There are no bosses in Monstro Town.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tYou can fight Jinx in Monstro Town's dojo as well as Culex in the locked door.  Before even arriving in Monstro Town, you can fight Belome for a second time in Belome Temple.  When you arrive at the dojo, you'll need to fight Jinx three times before you can be called the master of the dojo.  As you progress through the battles, Jinx will get much harder and introduce his Quicksilver attack.  On the other hand, Culex is the most difficult boss of the game. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss in Bean Valley?", "correct": "Megasmilax", "options": ["Megaplant", "Mega-Piranha", "Mega-grow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMegasmilax.\n\n\tWhen you arrive at the Megasmilax part of Bean Valley, you won't actually begin by fighting the boss.  A Shy Away will sprinkle water onto a Smilax plant and let it grow to devour you.  At the very end of the match, you should be fighting some regular Smilaxes as well as the Megasmilax.  The Megasmilax has some fire-based attacks like Flame Wall and Flame, but the ones you really need to look out for are Petal Blast and S'Crow Dust since they transform your characters.  After this battle, you'll get to climb to Nimbus Land.  You'll also get a Seed needed to obtain the Lazy Shells. \n"}, {"text": "Where can Shelly be found in Nimbus Land?", "correct": "In the castle", "options": ["In the hot springs", "In front of the castle", "In Garro's house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the castle.\n\n\tShelly is basically like Birdo.  When you enter her chamber in the castle in Nimbus Land, you'll be forced to fight her.  In the beginning, she'll still be in her egg, so attack it and crack it open.  During the fight, Shelly will do good damage with ranged attacks and she'll have great defense (despite low HP).  Use hard-hitting moves and healing moves during this boss to ensure that you get through the battle quickly and you don't lose a party member. \n"}, {"text": "After the fight with Valentina and Dodo, they will escape.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tWhen you reach the throne room of Nimbus Land's Castle, you'll need to chase Valentina and Dodo through the clouds and such.  Soon, you'll find that you aren't even in Nimbus Land anymore, so head back and begin the boss battle.  In the beginning, Dodo will take one party member (usually Mallow) and battle them one-on-one. Make sure that you have an abundance of healing items on you because Dodo is quite tough.  After this, you'll fight both Valentina and Dodo.  Valentina likes to make use of special attacks more than physical ones, so make sure that you have good Mg. Defense.  Some attacks include Light Beam, Aurora Flash and Petal Blast (which, from experience, are no laughing matter).  After the battle, Dodo will fly Valentina away. In the end of the game, she gets married to Booster. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the dragon found in Barrel Volcano?", "correct": "Czar Dragon", "options": ["Quazar Dragon", "Tzar Dragon", "Zarzar Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCzar Dragon.\n\n\tAfter a brief visit to Hinopio's shops and inn, you can invade the deepest part of the volcano containing the Czar Dragon.  This enemy will use primarily fire attacks (you could see that one coming), and when you finally defeat it, it will submerge itself in lava.  The battle isn't over yet though, the Czar Dragon's skeleton will rise from the lava and attack you.  The new form of the boss will use powerful attacks like Storm, Boulder, and Blast before you can defeat it.  After this, you can attempt to take the sixth star. \n"}, {"text": "What is not a colour of an Axem Ranger?", "correct": "Blue", "options": ["Black", "Pink", "Red"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlue.\n\n\tWhen you reach for the sixth star, the Axem Rangers will swipe it away and you'll need to chase them to the rim of the crater of the volcano.  When their ride arrive, you'll need to fight them.  Knock them off one by one and the red ranger will jump behind the controls of Blade to attack your party with the devastating Breaker Beam attack.  Between each attack, the beam will recharge giving you a chance to attack again.  After the battle, the Axem Rangers and Blade will be destroyed and you can claim the sixth star. \n"}, {"text": "How much HP does Magikoopa have?", "correct": "1600", "options": ["3200", "10", "1300"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1600.\n\n\tFor such a late part of the game, Magikoopa is a pretty easy boss.  There's really nothing to worry about here.  He really won't attack anyone physically, so you should watch your Mg. Defense points here, but it still shouldn't change much.  Magikoopa also has the ability to summon a monster that he can hide behind. Simply destroy the monster and continue to wail on him until he's done.  After the battle, Magikoopa will turn back to normal and he'll create a gold coin chest that will produce an infinite amount of coins.  This is great since you can easily purchase your final armor from Croco in the first door on the left without worrying about funds. \n"}, {"text": "Boomer is fought in Bowser's Keep.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tLike Magikoopa, Boomer will be a walk in the park.  Boomer takes a different approach by slowly attacking you physically rather than magically.  About half-way through the battle, Boomer will power himself up and change colour, but really it won't do much good.  After this seemingly simple battle, the Shy Guys holding up the chandeliers will take you on a ride to the roof. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the giant sword that crashed into Bowser's Keep?", "correct": "Exor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nExor.\n\n\tCompared to the last bosses, Exor is tough, there's no doubt about that.  During the battle, your aim is to take out the odd Exor thing on top of the sword.  To do this, you'll need to temporarily disable some of the sword's other features first.  You have choices between the mouth, the left eye, and the right eye. Each part of the boss has different attacks, but they're all pretty devastating, so it's your choice which one you take out.  Rock Candies or Fire/Ice Bombs might help you along if you're in deep trouble, but again, they'll only affect the three targets if none of them are disabled.  Once you've defeated Exor, you'll be able to enter the final destination, The Factory. \n"}, {"text": "What is not one of Countdown's attacks?", "correct": "Boulder", "options": ["Aurora Flash", "Water Blast", "Mega Recover"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoulder.\n\n\tCountdown is the first of many bosses in the Factory.  When you come across this clock, not only will you need to defeat it, but you'll need to defeat its two alarm bells.  On every turn that the clock takes, its hour hand will move and it will use a different attack such as Mega Recover, Water Blast or Aurora Flash.  Usually, Countdown's magic attacks will do huge amounts of damage.  Once you defeat it, you can advance deeper into the Factory \n"}, {"text": "Which enemy, near the end of the Factory, has the Breaker Beam attack?", "correct": "Gunyolk", "options": ["Mad Adder", "Manager", "Cloaker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGunyolk.\n\n\tThe final boss before Smithy is Gunyolk.  The Manager of the Factory will bring out the weapon just before you arrive in Smithy's chamber.  Like Blade during the Axem Ranger battle in Barrel Volcano, Gunyolk's primary attack will be the powerful Breaker Beam.  Whenever Gunyolk uses this attack, he will have to reload it which gives you a chance to either attack it or heal yourself.  After this battle, you can fight Smithy. \n"}, {"text": "How much HP does Smithy have in his final form?", "correct": "8000 HP", "options": ["4000 HP", "6000 HP", "2000 HP"], "explanation": "\n\n\n8000 HP.\n\n\tWhen you start the battle with Smithy, his smelting machine will spit out metal that he will shape into his useful sidekicks.  Simply get rid of the smelting machine to stop this.  Once you get rid of Smithy's HP, you'll crash through to the basement of the Factory and fight Smithy in his final form.  In this form, Smithy will transform his head into a something with a different strength.  After this battle, you'll beat the game! \n"}, {"text": "The most powerful optional boss of the game is Culex.  What object is needed for you to access his dimension?", "correct": "Shiny Stone", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nShiny Stone.\n\n\tTo reach Culex, you'll need to buy the Fireworks in Moleville, then give them to a little mole girl in town for the Shiny Stone.  Take this to the sealed door in Monstro Town and it will open for you.  Culex's boss battle is optional, but he's one of the most powerful in the game.  His four crystals each have their elemental magic attacks, and it's really what makes the battle hard.  Bring items that attack groups like Rock Candies or the elemental bombs to the battle.  If you beat him, then bravo.  You've beaten the hardest boss. \n"}]}
