Once he is out, Pickwick and Sam are off to win over the two angry young men, Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Allen.  The mission, following that, is to convince Winkle, Sr. of Arabella Allen's virtues. \n"}, {"text": "Who first notifies Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen about the marriage of Arabella Allen?  \n", "correct": "Ben's Aunt", "options": ["Arabella herself", "Bob's Mother", "Mr. Pickwick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen's Aunt.\n\n\tOf course Arabella and Winkle are terribly afraid of these two young fellows, so they send Pickwick and Sam Weller off to relay the news.  Just prior to their arrival, however, Ben Allen's aunt comes with the distressing news of Arabella's marriage.  Ben's and Bob's reactions are so violent that it causes the auntie to pass out.  Sam Weller's quote, upon seeing her on the floor, is priceless.  \"Here's a wenerable old lady a lyin' on the carpet waitin' for dissection, or galwinism, or some other rewivin' and scientific inwention.\"  Ha!  Pickwick finally reveals the identity of Ben's new brother-in-law, and convinces Ben and Bob to accept this reality. \n"}, {"text": "Which storyteller from an earlier chapter in the book pays his second visit to our cast, relating a new tale in chapter 49?  \n", "correct": "The bagman", "options": ["The parson", "The stroller", "The clergyman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe bagman.\n\n\tThis time the bagman tells a tall tale about his uncle that he of course claims is absolutely true!  His uncle encounters a ghost chaise and falls in love with a beautiful woman all in one evening, waking the next day with only the memories of his ghostly visits the night before.

On the verge of inflicting serious injury upon each other, their brawl is cut short by a quick-thinking Sam Weller, who wraps a meal-sack over Pott's head.

Attempting to take advantage of the death of Mrs. Weller, he insinuates himself into the good graces of Tony Weller, or so he thinks.  Not only does Tony Weller refuse to contribute to Mr. Stiggins' favorite cause, himself, he gives him a good battering.  I would venture to guess that in the end, only his ego was truly damaged in this attack, despite the relish with which Tony Weller physically assaults poor Stiggins.  We know for certain that he won't be returning to the Weller household anytime soon! \n"}, {"text": "To which city are Mr. Alfred Jingle and Job Trotter heading in chapter 53 to seek a new life thanks to the generosity of Mr. Pickwick?  \n", "correct": "Liverpool", "options": ["Birmingham", "York", "Norwich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiverpool.\n\n\tPickwick sets up a situation for Jingle in Liverpool, and Job Trotter faithfully follows, mirroring the faith that Sam Weller has for Pickwick.

Dickens was forever an optimist, I believe. \n"}, {"text": "Aside from Sam Weller, who else seems to be rather infatuated by the beautiful servant Mary?  \n", "correct": "Joe", "options": ["Ben Allen", "Job Trotter", "Mr. Tupman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe.\n\n\tThe Wardles' servant boy Joe seems to love three things: sleep, food, and the beautiful Mary.

Finally, we discover Mr. Weller's intention to retire from his regular trade, so he certainly won't be serving as Pickwick's coachman! \n"}, {"text": "Yes or no:  Does the elder Winkle finally accept the marriage between his son and Arabella Allen?  \n", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tIndeed, everything works out well for the Winkles, with the elder Winkle turning out to be a charming fellow who favors his excellent new daughter-in-law. \n"}, {"text": "In the end, Pickwick is the only member of the Pickwick Club (of the four members we are concerned with in the main body of the book) who does not get married.  \n", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tMr. Tracy Tupman does not wed, though he continues to admire the older women of his neighborhood.
