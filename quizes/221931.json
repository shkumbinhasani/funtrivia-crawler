{"id": "221931", "name": "Take this Daredevil Quiz! Easy Trivia |     Movies", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "    Movies D-G", "Daredevil"], "questions": [{"text": "Daredevil is one of the most popular heroes to emerge from the Marvel comic book universe.  Who plays the blind 'Man Without Fear' in the 2003 movie hit?", "correct": "Ben Affleck", "options": ["Ed Norton", "Matt Damon", "Heath Ledger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Affleck.\n\n\tBen Affleck was selected to portray Matt Murdock, a young man who, despite his blindness, has become a successful lawyer by day and a vigilante-style superhero by night.  Daredevil employs a set of stick-like weapons, dons a full-body suit of scarlet and leaves his characteristic 'DD' signal wherever he has practiced his specialty. \n"}, {"text": "No solo superhero movie would be complete without a lady love interest for the hero (assuming the hero is male!).  In this film, actress Jennifer Garner fits this bill as the lovely but elusive Elektra.  What is Elektra's surname?", "correct": "Natchios", "options": ["Pompeo", "DiVincenzo", "Garcia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNatchios.\n\n\tElektra Natchios is the daughter of a Greek tycoon.  This hasn't spoiled her, however, as she appears to be rather down to earth.  When Matt Murdock first encounters Elektra, she is resistant to him, particularly because he appears to be putting on the slick moves.  Eventually, after a good fight, she reveals her name. \n"}, {"text": "Hmm, what else does this movie need.  Oh yes, the buddy character for comic relief.  Which actor helps provide this function, portraying Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson, Matt Murdock's law partner and close friend?", "correct": "Jon Favreau", "options": ["Owen Wilson", "Vince Vaughn", "Ben Stiller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJon Favreau.\n\n\tJon Favreau does a decent job as the comic relief in the film.  I especially enjoyed his discussion about a client who paid for their lawyering services in kind, with flukes (a fluke being a kind of fish). \n"}, {"text": "Naturally, in a superhero movie you have your good guy and you have your bad guy, or in the case of this film, bad guys (plural).  In the case of this film, there is one bad guy who pulls the strings from behind the scenes, and he goes by the mysterious name Kingpin.  What is the Kingpin's given name?", "correct": "Wilson Fisk", "options": ["Aloysius Crudup", "George Pendleton", "Marcellus Wallace"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilson Fisk.\n\n\tWilson Fisk, aka the Kingpin, is portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Duncan is absolutely wicked in his portrayal of the evil crime boss, a far cry from the gentle character he played in the film 'The Green Mile'.  Daredevil is only able to physically confront the Kingpin towards the end of the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Okay, now for bad guy #2.  He is called Bullseye.  Why?  Because he never misses.  Who plays the deadly accurate villain Bullseye in the movie?", "correct": "Colin Farrell", "options": ["Benicio Del Toro", "Ralph Fiennes", "Clive Owen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nColin Farrell.\n\n\tBullseye uses conventional throwing weapons like darts and Chinese throwing stars, but he also employs items such as playing cards in his deadly arsenal.  Farrell's portrayal of Bullseye is twisted and sinister in a kind of campy, over-the-top style. \n"}, {"text": "Joe Pantoliano portrays Ben Urich in 'the guy who seems to have an uncanny insider knowledge about the superhero, and has a hunch about the superhero's true identity' role.  What is Urich's occupation?", "correct": "Reporter", "options": ["Private detective", "Policeman", "Lawyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReporter.\n\n\tJoe Pantoliano, a character actor who shows up in just about every other action-related film (for example, 'Bad Boys II', 'Memento' and 'The Matrix') is a sympathetic character in this film.  He is somehow able to discover Daredevil's true identity, but will he reveal it to the world? \n"}, {"text": "In several flashback scenes to Matt Murdock's childhood past, we encounter the young man's father, Jack Murdock.

In which sport is Mr. Murdock involved?", "correct": "Boxing", "options": ["Hockey", "Baseball", "Wrestling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoxing.\n\n\tJack Murdock is a boxer who seems to regret some lost opportunities, in other words, he could have been a contender.

Sadly, the elder Murdock is murdered when Matt is still a youngster. \n"}, {"text": "The movie 'Daredevil' features a couple of cameo appearances by men associated with the comic book.  Which prominent individual appears as an old man that Matt Murdock prevents from walking into traffic?", "correct": "Stan Lee", "options": ["Jack Kirby", "Frank Miller", "John Romita"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStan Lee.\n\n\tStan Lee, co-creator of both Marvel Comics and the Daredevil character, makes a well-deserved appearance in the movie in the scenario described above.  Frank Miller, who wrote and illustrated the comic book for several years, also makes a brief cameo.  Jack Kirby and John Romita also see their names appear at different points in the film, but the two men do not appear in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Despite attempts by several characters, nobody is able to eventually discover Matt Murdock's secret identity as Daredevil.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tIn fact, a number of characters discover that Murdock is Daredevil, including Elektra, Kingpin and Urich.  Father Everett, played by Derrick O'Connor, is also aware of Matt Murdock's alter ego. \n"}, {"text": "Which member of Elektra's family is killed by Bullseye, prompting the young woman to go on a rampage as she attempts to hunt down the murderer?", "correct": "Father", "options": ["Mother", "Brother", "Sister"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFather.\n\n\tElektra's father Nikolas Natchios is played by actor Erick Avari in the film.  He is murdered by Bullseye, but with Daredevil's weapon.
