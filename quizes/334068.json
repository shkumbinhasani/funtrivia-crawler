{"id": "334068", "name": "Overdogs! Trivia Game | Wide World of Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Wide World of Sports", "  Sports Upsets"], "questions": [{"text": "When you think of the best hockey nations in the world, Bulgaria doesn't really come to mind. In a pre-Olympic qualifier in 2008, the national women's team lost 30-1 to Croatia, 39-0 by Latvia, 41-0 to Italy, and closed it off with an 82-0 loss at the hands of what country?", "correct": "Slovakia", "options": ["Belarus", "Canada", "China"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSlovakia.\n\n\tSadly, Bulgaria didn't make the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, but you can still say they tried. The Slovaks scored 31 in the first period and followed it up with periods of 24 and 27. Maria Herichova led the Slovak charge with 8 goals and 10 assists. The final shot total in the game was 139-0. Lost in this was the Bulgarian goaltender, Liubomira Shosheva, who was not pulled from the game until after the 77th goal. This  means even though she let in 77, Shosheva still made a 56-save performance. \n"}, {"text": "Obviously not content with a 20-4 win over the St. Louis Browns, which Major League Baseball team, led by Ted Williams, went out the next day and put 29 up on St. Louis in 1950?", "correct": "Boston Red Sox", "options": ["Chicago Cubs", "New York Yankees", "Cincinnati Reds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston Red Sox.\n\n\tThe Red Sox were shutout in the first inning, but then compiled innings of 8, 5, 7, 2, 0, 2, and 5. Bobby Doerr hit 3 home runs and had 8 RBIs. Anyone with Sid Schacht in their fantasy pool suffered though. In 3.2 innings, the Browns reliever gave up 12 runs on 13 hits. St. Louis baseball fans didn't have to worry. Their other team, the Cardinals, beat the other Boston team, the Braves, 18-6 the same day. \n"}, {"text": "Winning a professional golf tournament is hard enough. Winning by 16 is a lot harder. Which of these golfers has not pulled that trick?", "correct": "Ben Hogan", "options": ["J.D. Edgar", "Joe Kirkwood Sr.", "Bobby Locke"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Hogan.\n\n\tThe 1919 Canadian Open (Edgar), 1924 Corpus Christi Open (Kirkwood), and the 1948 Chicago Victory National (Locke) were all not really a tournament as they were dominated by these 3 men. A notable 15-shot win goes to the 2000 US Open winner Tiger Woods who had a -12, compared to second place Ernie Els at +3. \n"}, {"text": "In the midst of an awful 2010-11 basketball season, the Cleveland Cavaliers went out west and lost a 112-57 blowout at the hands of which California team?", "correct": "Los Angeles Lakers", "options": ["Golden State Warriors", "Los Angeles Clippers", "Sacramento Kings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers.\n\n\tThe Cavaliers entered Los Angeles at 8-29, and played like an 8-29 team too. The Lakers at 28-11 played like a 28-11 team as well. What makes the game more surprising was that Ron Artest and Andrew Bynum scored the most points in the game, 15 each. Cleveland scored 25 points in the first half, and made only 30% of their shots. \n"}, {"text": "On his way to the Triple Crown, which of these legendary horses once won the Belmont Stakes by an shocking 31 lengths?", "correct": "Secretariat", "options": ["Affirmed", "Seattle Slew", "Citation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSecretariat.\n\n\tAfter wins in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness by 2-1/2 lengths, Belmont was what stood in the way between Secretariat and the first Triple Crown in 25 years. Although the first 6 furlongs saw competition, Secretariat galloped away from the field. He finished in 2:24, breaking the old record by 2 seconds. The Triple Crown winner never won any leg of the Triple Crown, outside of 1973. The horse was jockeyed by Ron Turcotte, and trained by Lucien Laurin. \n"}, {"text": "A case of mistaken identity led to this blowout. In 1885, British soccer  officials invited a team from what sport to the Scottish Cup, and lost 36-0?", "correct": "Cricket", "options": ["Rowing", "Rugby", "Field Hockey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCricket.\n\n\tThe Aberdeen cricket team did not have any Pele's or David Beckham's on their team, which fell in one of the ugliest games in soccer history to Aberdeen. The 36-0 score might not have even been the correct one. Referee Dave Stormont later said that he was a too strict in calling offsides, a move that cost Aberdeen seven goals. It wasn't like they needed them though. \n"}, {"text": "In 1965, Ned Jarrett won a race at the Darlington Raceway. Jarrett won by a mere 14 laps, or 19.25 miles. Which auto racing league did this event happen in?", "correct": "NASCAR", "options": ["F1", "V8 Supercars", "American Le Mans Series"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNASCAR.\n\n\tHow embarrassing must it feel to be passed by the same driver, over and over again? That is how the other competitors felt. The race also included the famous sight of Cale Yarborough's car flying over the wall. Jarrett gained his advantage when the two leaders had their engines expire at the same time. The race was overshadowed with tragedy though, as rookie driver Buren Skeen died after his car was slammed into after spinning out. \n"}, {"text": "In a way to protest an official's call, one soccer coach made his players score 149 times on their own net, all which counted for their opponents. Where did this blowout happen in 2002?", "correct": "Madagascar", "options": ["Pakistan", "Peru", "Egypt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMadagascar.\n\n\tStade Olympique L'Emyrne was eliminated from first place contention the week before, and in the final week, things got ugly. The previous game had ended on a disputed penalty, and when another arose early in to the final game. L'Emyrne coach Zaka Be went berserk and told his team to score repeatedly on their own net. The opposition, AS Adema, didn't say no to the offer. Don't think L'Emyrne were slouches. They won the Madagascar Championship the year before, and advanced to Round 2 in that year's African Champions League. \n"}, {"text": "A close college football game of 222-0. It happened in 1916, when Cumberland College sent 14 nobody's down to this university, to avoid a monetary penalty and lost by 222.", "correct": "Georgia Tech", "options": ["Florida State", "Georgia", "University of Miami (Florida)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorgia Tech.\n\n\tCumberland had scrapped its football program before the season, but could not avoid the powerhouse Georgia Tech matchup. When they arrived, they were kindly greeted with 63 in the first two quarters. The third and forth saw the Engineers slow down, only scoring 54 and 42. Georgia Tech scored on every drive, and racked up 1620 running yards.The victor never attempted to make a pass in the game. The reason for running up the score has two reasons. One was to avenge Cumberland's 22-0 baseball win over Georgia Tech, and another is how the rankings were based on points scored, something Georgia Tech didn't like and protested during this game. \n"}, {"text": "This happened on December 8 1940. In the 1940 NFL championship game, the Washington Redskins lost to the Chicago Bears by what, now infamous score?", "correct": "73-0", "options": ["68-6", "59-0", "102-14"], "explanation": "\n\n\n73-0.\n\n\tThe Bears got all 73 points on touchdowns. They missed extra points on 3, and went 1-2 on 2-point conversions. Chicago's quarters were 21, 7, 26, 19. It was the first time a NFL Championship had been broadcast on radio. Chicago had a reason to run up the score. After a 7-3 loss to the Redskins 3 weeks before, Washington owner George Preston Marshall called the Bears crybabies and quitters. \n"}]}
