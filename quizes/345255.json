{"id": "345255", "name": "The Book of James Quiz | New Testament | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", " New Testament", " James"], "questions": [{"text": "What is the first word in the book of James in the King James Version?", "correct": "James", "options": ["A", "John", "The"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames.\n\n\tIt says in James 1:1, \"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.\"\r Many believe that the James that wrote the book of James was the half-brother of Jesus. However, there is no evidence to prove this, so we cannot be sure which of the Jameses wrote this book. \n"}, {"text": "According to James, a man who endures what shall receive the crown of life?", "correct": "temptation", "options": ["tyranny", "court trials", "tanning"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntemptation.\n\n\tIt says in James 1:12, \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.\"\r Temptation is very difficult to resist, but Christians believe this can be done with the help of the Holy Spirit.  Others may not believe in \"the Holy Spirit\" but may believe in a Higher Power to help them through these temptations. \n"}, {"text": "According to James Chapter 2, if you only break part of the law, is it okay?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tIt says in James 2:10, \"For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.\" \r According to the KJV of the Bible, not only does one break the entire law if s/he breaks any part of it, but also if s/he only sins mentally. If they commit the act in their mind, they are guilty of sin as well (for example, see Matthew 5:28). \n"}, {"text": "Complete this verse from James 2:26 (KJV): \"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without ________ is dead also.\" ", "correct": "works", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nworks.\n\n\tDifferent denominations interpret this verse differently. Some interpret it as saying that one needs to have faith and good works to get into to Heaven. Others believe that one has to be saved by faith alone to get into Heaven. Then, once they are saved, they will do good works to show their faith. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 3 of James, the Bible talks about a part of the body. What is this body part that is described as untameable, evil, and filled with poison?", "correct": "tongue", "options": ["spine", "hand", "heart"], "explanation": "\n\n\ntongue.\n\n\tIt says in James 3:8, \"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\"\r When a person gossips about another person, spreading untrue rumors, they can cause that person a lot of damage because others might believe the rumors are true. \n"}, {"text": "James 3:10 (KJV) says, \"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.\" James then goes on to give examples to explain this. Which is *not* an example he gives?", "correct": "oil and vinegar", "options": ["salt water and fresh water", "fig tree and olives", "vine and figs"], "explanation": "\n\n\noil and vinegar.\n\n\tIt becomes hypocritical when a person speaks blessings and curses since they are so opposite.

", "correct": "Job", "options": ["Jacob", "Jeremiah", "John"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJob.\n\n\tIt says in 5:11, \"Behold we count them happy which endure.  Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.\"\r If you are not familiar with the story of Job in the Old Testament, Job was a righteous man.
