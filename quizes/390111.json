The conversation is a bit awkward, especially since something is making an inordinate amount of noise from his ghost trap.  When he heads into his room he ends up evicting his turtle from his terrarium and placing the new creature inside.  He feeds it a few chunks of a 3 Musketeers bar and calls it D'Artagnan.  That night, while Dustin sleeps nearby, the creature shudders in its cage and lets out a shriek. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper tries to assure Eleven that she will be able to see Mike again.  When does he say this will happen?", "correct": "Soon", "options": ["Tomorrow", "In a week", "In a month"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSoon.\n\n\tUltimately, Hopper kept putting Eggos in the chest in the woods, even though it got deeper and deeper into winter.  Eventually, Eleven revealed herself to the police chief.\rNow, Eleven is still angry with Hopper for showing up late to Halloween.  She brushes aside her reservations for an Eggo breakfast though.  The two of them talk about how dangerous it is to go out, even though Eleven knows how much Mike needs her help.  Hopper has nothing to tell her but 'soon'.\rAt the Byers house, Joyce searches for her car keys and Bob ends up being the one to drive Will to work.\rDustin, meanwhile, heads to the library for books about reptiles and amphibians, stealing them when it becomes apparent he already has five books checked out of the library. \n"}, {"text": "Who tells Will how to get rid of bad dreams?", "correct": "Bob", "options": ["Joyce", "Max", "Jonathan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBob.\n\n\tOn the drive to school, Bob asks about noises he heard the previous night and Mike says it was probably him.  Bob tells him a story about a time he had nightmares and the dreams went away when he had a bad one and told it to 'go away', easy as that.\rDustin shows up late for a lesson in science class and, in front of Mr. Clarke, tells the other guys (and Max, at the back of the class) to meet him in the AV Club room at lunch.  No one notices the shaking ghost container in his backpack.\rHopper gets back to the station to plot out the destroyed crops on a map and discovers that the incidents form a clear pattern with the U.S. Department of Energy lab in the center. \n"}, {"text": "The tripwires around Hopper's cabin are attached to which of these?", "correct": "Mousetraps", "options": ["Guns", "Bells", "Matchsticks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMousetraps.\n\n\tEleven almost decides to try the blindfold one more time but, instead, she heads to the front door and contemplates undoing the locks.  She remembers Hopper bringing her back to the cabin, claiming his grandfather used to live there but he had since used it for storage.  It was a fixer-upper when they came upon it, but it would become her new home. Over the days, he and Eleven would clean the building and devise a series of tripwires around the cabin as an alarm system.  He vowed no one would come for her, but they would have a series of rules anyways.  First, the curtains would always need to be drawn. Second, the door could only be opened if he used his secret knock.  Third, she couldn't go out alone, especially not in daylight.  Eleven decides to break all three. \n"}, {"text": "Dart hates heat.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAt school, Steve plays basketball against Billy, at least until Nancy comes along and asks to talk.  She tells Steve she missed first period because she slept in and asks why he didn't wake her, but she also claims not to remember what happened at the party the previous night when she drank too much, said her relationship with Steve was all a lie, and told him she didn't love him.  When it comes down to it, she's not able to tell Steve she loves him.\rIn the AV club room, the kids all get their opportunity to hold D'artagnan, who Dustin nicknames 'Dart' for short.  He tells the others that he originally thought it was a pollywog, like a tadpole, but he doesn't need water, and the only ones like that live in India and South America.  Further, Dart hates heat, unlike a reptile, since it hurts him.  Will doesn't tell the others what he thinks of when he sees it. \n"}, {"text": "According to Jonathan, who asked that Nancy be driven home?", "correct": "Steve", "options": ["Her mother", "Joyce", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteve.\n\n\tBob shows up at Joyce's work to have lunch and chat.  He tells her he hopes he's not overstepping anything, but he likes her and her family so much.  Joyce says that she can tell-- the boys like him too.  He noticed this morning, however, that his video camera was a bit beat up.  When he watched the video though, he noticed some kids picking on Will.\rHopper brings his findings about the decaying plants back to the Department of Energy labs and confronts Dr. Owens about them.  Owens says that the last burn was only a couple days earlier, but Hopper says that maybe there's a leak.\rAt school, Nancy asks Jonathan about the previous night and he lies, saying Steve asked him to drive her home.  Both of them admit that things are tough, what with everything they know about the Upside-Down.  But maybe, Jonathan says, things can't go back to the way they were.  That's when Nancy gets an idea. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce sees something in the video recording made by Will on Halloween night.  She draws it on which of these?", "correct": "Wax paper", "options": ["A newspaper", "The wall", "Construction paper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWax paper.\n\n\tIn the woods, Eleven eventually hikes her way to the edge of the suburbs where she spies a woman pushing her child on a swing.  She remembers Hopper reading to her in bed one night and she asked whether or not she had a mother.  Hopper told her the truth-- she had a mother, but she wasn't around anymore.  While she thought this, the woman and her child saw her on the edge of the woods and asked after her, but Eleven only responded by asking for the direction of the school.\rJoyce heads home and pops the cassette from the video camera into the VCR, struggling to do so enough to call Bob and figure out how to connect the coaxial cable into the device.  She watches the video Will took, fast forwarding to the bullies, and as the camera hits the ground, she notices some odd distortion.  A quick pause concerns her.  When she freezes the frame, she sees a frightening image burned onto the screen.  She draws it using a crayon and a piece of wax paper and compares it to Will's image.  It seems to be whatever he saw in the Upside-Down. \n"}, {"text": "When Dart escapes the ghost trap, what does he do in front of the boys?", "correct": "Sprouts legs", "options": ["Eats a frog", "Splits in two", "Speaks English"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSprouts legs.\n\n\tBilly ends up leaving school without Max when she doesn't turn up to the car on time to get a ride home.  Instead, she's in with the guys because Dustin is about to show Dart to Mr. Clarke.  He is, however, interrupted very abruptly by Mike and Will, both of whom come to the realization that something very serious is at work. They take Dart to the AV room again, this time leaving Max outside the door because she doesn't know.  There, Mike theorizes that maybe Will attained True Sight in the Upside-Down, and his recent flashes aren't memories, but real glimpses into the Upside-Down as it is.  They argue that maybe they should take Dart to Hopper, but Dustin is nervous about doing so...at least until Dart starts making loud noises inside the ghost box. Dart breaks out, now larger than before, before sprouting legs before their very eyes and jumping off the table.  It's an unfortunate moment for all of them; Max picks the lock on the door and the creature escapes. \n"}, {"text": "According to Mike, what role did El have in the group's party?", "correct": "Mage", "options": ["Cleric", "Bard", "Paladin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMage.\n\n\tNancy and Jonathan head back to the Wheeler household, the two of them unsure about the purchase they made at Radio Shack.  They call Barb's mother and Nancy tells her she has to be honest, so she wants to meet at a local park the next day.  The line is recorded as she says this.\rScientists from the lab gather samples from the area's pumpkin patches while Hopper and Dr. Owens talk off to the side.  Owens suggests that they keep the area closed off for a couple more days.  That's when Hopper gets a call on his walkie; the mother from before seems to be reporting a 'Russian girl' in the neighbourhood.\rEleven, meanwhile, makes it back to the school, finding Mike's bike parked out front.  Mike happens to be inside, still looking for Dart, having split up with the boys to cover more ground.  He ends up searching in the gymnasium, finding Max also looking in the boys' locker room.  That's when she asks him why he doesn't like her, and it somewhat comes down to there not being a role for her in their party, especially since El was their mage.  Max argues that she can join the boys' party as a 'zoomer', even though that's not a class, especially since El evidently moved away at some point, and this conversation is loud enough for El to hear it when she walks by they gym.  At the door, she watches as Max rides her skateboard, and seeing Mike with her, she jealously makes her fall.  When Max claims it's almost like a magnet tugged her board, Mike realizes something is amiss; by the time he goes to check the hallway, Eleven is already gone. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Will end up finding Dart after his escape?", "correct": "In a bathroom", "options": ["In the staff lounge", "In the AV room", "In the gymnasium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a bathroom.\n\n\tAt the Byers house, Joyce calls the school only to find that AV club was cancelled.  It takes no time for her to hop into her car and drive out to pick him up.\rWill is ultimately the one to locate Dart in one of the bathrooms at school, finding him behind a toilet.  Finding Dart is enough to tip Will back into the Upside-Down, just as a dark entity begins to snake its way through the corridor.  He runs out of the school to try and escape.\rDustin is the one to find Dart next, and to avoid having the kids take him, he hides him away under his cap.\rWill ends up remembering what Bob said to him in the car about not running, so despite his fears he stands his ground, even as the giant creature of the Upside-Down looms over him.  He yells for it to go away as its smoky form begins forcing its way into his body. \n"}]}
