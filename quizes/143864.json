Quiz | Rugby League | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "  Rugby League", "      Australia"], "questions": [{"text": "If you knock the ball in the direction of the opposition team's dead ball line whilst playing at the ball and do not regather before the ball hits the ground, then that is a knock-on?", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tKnock on means to knock the ball toward the oppositions dead ball line with the hand or arm, while playing at the ball.  However, if, after knocking on accidentally, you regain or kick the ball before it touches the ground, a goal post, cross bar or an opponent, then it's not a knock-on! \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following does NOT constitute a legal tackle?", "correct": "When a player, not being held by the opposition, falls to the ground", "options": ["When a player is lying on the ground and an opposition player puts a hand on him", "When a player is held by one or more opposition players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball contacts the ground", "When a player is held by one or more opposition players in such a way that he cannot make further progress and cannot pass the ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen a player, not being held by the opposition, falls to the ground.\n\n\tA player in possession of the ball is tackled if:- the ball-carrier is held by one or more opposition players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground, - the ball-carrier is held by one or more opposing players in a way that he cannot make further progress and cannot pass the ball, - if the ball-carrier, held by an opponent, succumbs to the tackle and wants to be released in order to play the ball, and - when the ball-carrier is lying on the ground and an oppositiont player places a hand on him. \n"}, {"text": "When does the ball come 'into play' after the play the ball?", "correct": "When the ball is 'heeled' backwards by the tackled player", "options": ["When the opposition players have cleared the ruck after the tackle", "When the tackled player has faced the opposition's goal line", "When the tackled player has regained his feet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen the ball is 'heeled' backwards by the tackled player.\n\n\tThe tackled player has regained his feet where he was tackled and lifts the ball clear of the ground, faces his opponent's goal line and places the ball on the ground in front of his foremost foot; when the ball touches the ground it must be 'heeled' back by the tackled player.  The ball is in play when it is 'heeled' backwards! \n"}, {"text": "When is 'dissent' allowed in a game of Australian Rugby League?", "correct": "None of these", "options": ["After a scrum", "After a penalty", "After a try"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone of these.\n\n\tAfter a penalty has been given, and further misconduct by the offending team occurs, the Referee shall advance the mark 10 metres toward the offending team's goal line.  A player is guilty of misconduct if he uses offensive language or disputes a decision by the Referee or Touch Judge.  If 'dissent' was tolerated the Official's respect would be lesser.  If misconduct persists after the mark has been advanced once, the Referee may sin bin/dismiss the offender but cannot advance the mark again. \n"}, {"text": "When is the ball determined to have been 'grounded'?", "correct": "When downward pressure has been exerted with the hand/s, arm or the body above the waist and below the neck", "options": ["When downward pressure with the leg has been exerted on the ball", "When the ball has been dropped on the ground", "When a player sits on the ball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen downward pressure has been exerted with the hand/s, arm or the body above the waist and below the neck.\n\n\tGrounding the ball means having placed the ball on the ground with the hand(s) or, having exerted downward pressure on the ball with the hand or arm, the ball itself has to be on the ground or, having dropped the ball and covered it with the body above the waist and below the neck, the ball itself has to be on the ground. \n"}, {"text": "When is a forward pass not a forward pass?", "correct": "When it is relative to the ground and not the passing player", "options": ["When it is relative to the defending players", "When it is relative to the player receiving the ball", "When it is relative to the Referee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen it is relative to the ground and not the passing player.\n\n\tThe direction of a pass is in relation to the player making the pass and not in relation to the ground.  A player running towards his opponents' goal line may throw the ball towards a team-mate who is behind him but because of the passer's momentum the ball travels forward relative to the ground.  This is not a forward pass as the passer has not passed the ball forward in relation to himself. \n"}, {"text": "Who is described as a 'dominant' tackler(s)?", "correct": "The tackler/s being on top of the ball carrier", "options": ["The tackler/s loitering in the tackle", "The tackler/s holding the ball carrier by the ankle/s", "The tackler/s stripping the ball in a three man tackle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe tackler/s being on top of the ball carrier.\n\n\tWhen the player carrying the ball is stopped and pushed back from the point of impact, the tackler being on top of the ball carrier would be deemed a 'dominant tackler'.  The gain for being dominant would be that the tackler would be capable of pushing up off the tackled player instead of rolling quickly to one side.  This would enable the tackler to take up a position at marker and for his team-mates to be ready to defend. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following correctly finishes this sentence, \"A try is scored when ______ . \" ?", "correct": "a tackled player's momentum carries him into the oppositions in-goal where he grounds the ball", "options": ["a tackled player slides over the oppositions dead ball line where he grounds the ball", "an opposition player tackles the ball carrier over the touch line just on the try line and the ball carrier grounds the ball", "a tackled player's momentum carries him to the try line and he gets up and drops the ball over the line"], "explanation": "\n\n\na tackled player's momentum carries him into the oppositions in-goal where he grounds the ball.\n\n\tA try is scored when a tackled player's momentum carries him into the oppositions in-goal where the ball is grounded even if the ball has touched the ground in the field of play, provided that the ball crosses the goal line when the player is not in touch or touch in goal or on or over the dead ball line.  If a tackled player slides along the ground, a tackle is deemed to have been effected where the slide ends. \n"}, {"text": "What happens if a player, attempting a drop goal, is fouled by an opposition player?", "correct": "A penalty kick is awarded in front of the goal posts", "options": ["The opposition player has to kick for goal", "A penalty try is awarded underneath the goal posts", "Play must be restarted from the centre of the halfway line"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA penalty kick is awarded in front of the goal posts.\n\n\tThe rule in this instance applies to the kicker only.  A foul on another player from the kicker's team is dealt with as an obstruction and a penalty is awarded where the ball bounced or was caught in the field of play, or ten metres opposite to where the ball first crossed the line in the event of the ball going into touch on the full or landing past the goal line on the full. \n"}, {"text": "In Australian Rugby League, what is a 'flop'?", "correct": "When a tackle has been completed and another player drops on the ball carrier", "options": ["When one or more of the opposition drop on the ball carrier during the play the ball", "When a tackled player has not brought the arm holding the ball in contact with the ground", "The team who is losing the match!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhen a tackle has been completed and another player drops on the ball carrier.\n\n\tThe so called \"flop\" is when a tackle has been completed and the player in possession of the ball is held by one or more opponents and the ball or the arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground, and another player, not involved in the tackle, drops or \"flops\" on the ball carrier in order to slow the speed of the play the ball. \n"}]}
