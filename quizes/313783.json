What was the name of his fiancee?", "correct": "Linda", "options": ["Julia", "Christine", "Holly"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLinda.\n\n\tWell, one can easily call it \"Runaway Bride\" syndrome.\rIn the 1998 Adam Sandler film, \"The Wedding Singer\", the eighties are in full swing.  Robbie Hart is about to marry his fiance, Linda, but she leaves him at the altar, claiming that she couldn't go through with it, since he can't leave his steady career as a wedding singer behind.  He meets Julia, a newly-engaged waitress (played by Drew Barrymore) who asks for his help in planning her wedding, but along the way the two hit it off quite well.  Robbie goes to great extremes to help Julia out and soon discovers that her fiancee, Glenn (whose last name is Gulia), has been cheating on her.  This culminates with his sneaking onto a plane where he (along with help from other first-class passengers and Billy Idol) sings a song on his guitar for her and wins her over. \n"}, {"text": "METHOD #8: \"Leave them on a jet plane.\"\n\nWhich film made use of the Chantal Kreviazuk cover \"Leavin' On A Jet Plane\" to signify the departure of Ben Affleck's character on the spaceship?", "correct": "Armageddon", "options": ["The Core", "Deep Impact", "Space Cowboys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArmageddon.\n\n\t\"Armageddon\", upon its theatrical release in 1998, gained popularity in the box office, grossing over five hundred fifty million in its run.  Well known as one of the numerous asteroid movies released around the same time (remember \"Deep Impact\"?), it prevailed as one of the most popular films of the year. Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler, the film takes a number of men, most of whom are top oil drillers, and sends them into space to stop a large asteroid from colliding with our ill-fated planet.  Despite its use at one of the more pivotal moments of the film (when Ben Affleck leaves Bruce Wwillis' daughter behind) the Chantal Kreviazuk cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" was only one of the big hits off the film. Aerosmith's \"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\" was also a major charting single. \n"}, {"text": "METHOD #12: \"Leave them for their psychiatrist.\"\n\nIn \"Anger Management\", who played Adam Sandler's psychiatrist?", "correct": "Jack Nicholson", "options": ["John C. Reilly", "Jim Carrey", "Will Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack Nicholson.\n\n\tIn this 2003 film, Dave Buznik (played by Adam Sandler) consistently works and can't find it in himself to show public affection with his girlfriend (played by Marisa Tomei).  He becomes involved in a rather long-winded scheme with Jack Nicholson who, throughout the course of the movie, makes him believe he has true anger issues. At one point, however, his girlfriend ends up leaving with Jack Nicholson in a weird twist, and it's up to Dave to head to Yankees Stadium to stop the proposal he had originally set up for her.  As it turns out, everything (for the most part) was orchestrated by the psychiatrist. Everybody sings the song \"I Feel Pretty\" in a circle and it fades to black- perhaps a worse fate than leaving your lover? \n"}, {"text": "METHOD #16: \"Depart inexplicably.\"\n\nJames Bond has had numerous sexual partners over the years.  Who of these was not a Bond Girl and an ally?", "correct": "Famke Janssen", "options": ["Halle Berry", "Olga Kurylenko", "Jane Seymour"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFamke Janssen.\n\n\tAlthough Famke Janssen appeared in Pierce Brosnan's first James Bond film, \"Goldeneye\", she played one of the antagonists, Xenia Onatopp.  When she jumps down on Bond from a helicopter protecting the cradle in Cuba, he ends up killing her by strapping her into a parachute and crushing her against a tree (quipping 'she always liked a good squeeze').  Halle Berry played Jinx in the twentieth Bond film, \"Die Another Day\", Jane Seymour was in \"Live and Let Die\" as Solitaire, and Olga Kurylenko teamed up with Bond in the 2008 film \"Quantum of Solace\".  Notably, Olga Kurylenko was the first Bond girl to not have a sexual relationship with the titular secret agent.\n"}, {"text": "METHOD #25: \"Don't leave.\"\n\nSome people just don't want to leave their lovers in the first place.

When a girl, Erika Christensen, seduces him upon her arrival at his school, he soon comes to realize that she wants more than just a one-night stand.  Of course, she wants to be with him and he's more than worried about her stalking him.  When it turns out that she's willing to kill those who get in the way, he needs to find a way to sop her from being his obsessed swimfan.\r\"Swimfan\" reached #1 in the box office grossing nearly thirty million.  John Polson, the director of \"Swimfan\", also directed \"Hide and Seek\". \n"}, {"text": "METHOD #31: \"Let him duke it out with your other lover.\"\n\nIn \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fought in which of these locations, to show their love for Renee Zellweger?", "correct": "Restaurant", "options": ["London Bridge", "Police station", "Courtroom"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRestaurant.\n\n\tIn this 2001 adaptation of a Helen Fielding novel (based on Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\"), Hugh Grant cheats and lies while Colin Firth feels repulsed by Renee Zellweger's poor choices during the film, but she effectively grows on both.  This comes to a head during Bridget's birthday party when Darcy (played by Firth) helps out in making dinner and Daniel (played by Grant) ends up stopping by.  Soon, their fight heads outside and (to Geri Halliwell's cover of \"It's Raining Men\") and they fight their way through a Greek restaurant before crashing through the front window.\rInevitably, Jones chooses Darcy...and then Darcy chooses Jones...and then there's leopard print underwear.

In this movie, Hudson plays a magazine reporter who sets out to create the article 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'.  Unfortunately for her, things don't really work out as planned.  She falls for the guy, he falls for her, and she realizes that sometimes you can't please everyone.  She still writes the article and the two go off at each other during a diamond showing, but in the end, they still get together, after a momentous chase across the city.\rThe film grossed one hundred seventy-seven million in the box office and took #1 in the box office.

She awakens without her daughter and vows revenge on the members of Bill's assassination squad (played by Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen).  Sometimes, there's not really a clean getaway, but when Bill (David Carradine) simply makes matters worse for his 'Black Mamba', it hits the fan.  \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" and \"Kill Bill Vol. 2) (2003 and 2004, respectively) followed The Bride's journey around the world to kill those responsible, and yes, she does get her just revenge in the end.\rCombined, these two Quentin Tarantino films grossed over $300,000,000 in the international box office.  Both films reached #1. \n"}, {"text": "METHOD 47: \"Accidentally let it slip that you're a gigolo.\"\n\nIn \"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo\", who accidentally reveals to Kate that Deuce has been offering his unique services to other women?", "correct": "Kate's friends", "options": ["TJ", "She found out on her own", "Antoine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKate's friends.\n\n\tReleased in 1999, \"Deuce Bigalow\" starred Rob Schneider in the role of Deuce, a fish tank cleaner who gets a job taking care of a rather rare fish for a man who, as it turns out, is a famous male gigolo.  When the man goes out for a business trip to Europe, Deuce is asked to stay and look after the fish. But when he ends up destroying a rather large fish tank fixture, he takes it upon himself to become a gigolo with help of his client's friend and pimp, TJ.

Which actor is framed?", "correct": "Leslie Nielsen", "options": ["Harrison Ford", "Craig Bierko", "Charlie Sheen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeslie Nielsen.\n\n\tReleased in 1998, this parody film takes shots at a number of recent (at the time) action films, particularly \"The Fugitive\" starring Harrison Ford.  Leslie Nielsen's character, Ryan Harrison, ends up in the midst of a horrible affair with Lauren Goodhue, a woman who decides to kill her husband in order to start a terrorist assassination against the Secretary General of the UN.  Soon, love triangles, one-armed-one-legged-one-eyed men, low-flying remote control planes, and similar oddities get in the way.
