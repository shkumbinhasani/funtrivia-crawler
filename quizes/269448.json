{"id": "269448", "name": "Weapons of \"Twilight Princess\" Trivia Game  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "The first weapon of the game is the slingshot.  How much does it cost?", "correct": "30 Rupees", "options": ["40 Rupees", "20 Rupees", "50 Rupees"], "explanation": "\n\n\n30 Rupees.\n\n\tThe slingshot is the first weapon in this game, even surpassing the first sword used in the game.  In order to obtain it, you must first use a hawk to collect a cradle for Uli's baby, and then use the fishing rod given to you to catch fish in front of Sera's pet cat near the Ordon Village dock.  Once the cat returns home, you can buy the Slingshot from Sera's shop, though you'll need a bunch of Rupees to get it. \n"}, {"text": "Which character will leave the Wooden Sword in your house?", "correct": "Rusl", "options": ["Ilia", "Midna", "Talo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRusl.\n\n\tRusl is known as a very skilled swordsman and he is responsible for two primary weapons in the game.  The first of these is the Wooden Sword, which Link will obtain after collecting the Slingshot.  This sword will only be used for a short portion of the game, but it will be needed in order for Link to reach the Forest Temple for the first time. \n"}, {"text": "You will obtain the Ordon Sword while in wolf-form.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tShortly after escaping from Hyrule Castle, Midna will require that you travel back to Ordon Village in order to obtain weapons.  Here, you can obtain the Ordon Shield in the water-wheel house's loft and the Ordon Sword, a metal blade, by digging your way into Rusl's house.  This sword can be used after you collect the tears in Faron Woods and you are transformed back into a human. \n"}, {"text": "The Boomerang is the second ranged weapon of the game.  Where must you fight to obtain it?", "correct": "Forest Temple", "options": ["Goron Mines", "Death Mountain", "Faron Woods"], "explanation": "\n\n\nForest Temple.\n\n\tDuring your journey through the Forest Temple, you should be able to find four monkeys in the first half of the area.  Using these creatures to help you across the windy chasm that cuts through the temple, you can reach the mini-boss, Ook's chamber where you can battle him.  After knocking him off of his pedestals and swording him enough, the parasite on his back will die and he'll run away leaving the weapon behind.  This boomerang, with the power of the Fairy of Winds captured within, can activate switches and utilize the powers of the winds. \n"}, {"text": "The Hero's Bow is obtained in the Goron Mines.  How many arrows can you hold when you first get the weapon?", "correct": "Thirty", "options": ["Sixty", "Twenty", "Fifty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThirty.\n\n\tThe Hero's Bow has made appearances in numerous \"Zelda\" games, and with the new Wii Remote, players now get the chance to aim manually with Bluetooth technology.  In order to obtain the Hero's Bow, you need to defeat Dangoro, the Goron guardian of the Hero's Bow who can be found after obtaining the second Key Shard.  In order to obtain additional quivers for the bow, you'll need to complete the mini-game in the circus tent in Hyrule Castle Town \n"}, {"text": "You get two Clawshots in the game.  The first is in the Lakebed Temple.  Where is the second?", "correct": "City in the Sky", "options": ["Gerudo Mesa", "Temple of Time", "Arbiter's Grounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCity in the Sky.\n\n\tThe Double Clawshot is crucial in helping you navigate the mysterious City in the Sky.  These Clawshots allow Link to cross areas by using the various medallions on the walls.  In order to obtain them, you need to defeat the Deku Toad of Lakebed Temple and the Aerofols at the mid-point of the City in the Sky.  The new weapons are crucial in defeating Morpheel and Argorok in their respective dungeons. \n"}, {"text": "The Master Sword is found in the Temple of Time in the past.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAfter navigating the Skull Kid's obscure Sacred Woods and completing the puzzle generated by the aging temple guards, you can remove the legendary Master Sword from its pedestal and bring it on your journey.  With this in your possession you can transform between your wolf and human forms at will (providing that no one is looking when you do it).  The sword is only found during the present time, and it must be obtained after you complete the Lakebed Temple, and you return to the grove when opening the door to the Temple of Time. This is done after you fully return power to the sword and place it back into its pedestal. \n"}, {"text": "What weapon is obtained in Snowpeak Ruins?", "correct": "Ball and Chain & The Ball and Chain", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBall and Chain & The Ball and Chain.\n\n\tThe Ball and Chain is a new weapon in the world of \"Zelda\" and it's quite an interesting one at that.  You throw the ball in order to destroy large obstacles and enemies.  In Snowpeak Ruins this is particularly useful seeing as you need to get past many icy barriers.  Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming power of the object, it is unsurprisingly heavy, and it will slow you down when you carry it outside your inventory.  Put it away to move at your normal pace. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives Link the Giant Bomb Bag?", "correct": "Iza", "options": ["Rusl", "Coro", "Barnes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIza.\n\n\tIf you are able to earn a respectable twenty-five points in the Rapid Ride owned by Iza on the Northern Zora River (next to the fishing area), then Iza will hand over the Giant Bomb Bag.  Bombs are important throughout the game in different locations, but they aren't obtainable until after you complete the Goron Mines.  Once this is done, head to Barnes' Bomb Shop and purchase some for 30 Rupees.  Of course there's a better deal.  If you spend 120 Rupees, you get the Bombs and a free Bomb Bag.  Getting the Giant Bomb Bag will increase the capacity of every Bomb Bag you get in the game. \n"}, {"text": "Water Bombs are needed to open which dungeon?", "correct": "Lakebed Temple & The Lakebed Temple & Lakebed", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLakebed Temple & The Lakebed Temple & Lakebed.\n\n\tShortly after you rid Lanyaru Province of twilight, these bombs will be available to purchase from Barnes.  Although they are double the price of regular bombs, they're a vast improvement- especially since regular bombs will short out when you throw them into a body of water.  Basically, that's the only difference between the two, but without them, you really won't be able to get far past the Goron Mines.  These bombs open the Lakebed Temple, but they also blast their way to tons of Pieces of Hearts and such. \n"}]}
