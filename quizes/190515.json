B. Jeffries' can be found on a leg cast in which of the following Hitchcock films?", "correct": "Rear Window", "options": ["North by Northwest", "Vertigo", "The Man Who Knew Too Much"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRear Window.\n\n\tFans of the great Hitch probably will have recognized the phrase immediately, especially considering what a prominent role the leg cast worn by actor Jimmy Stewart plays in the film.  The Stewart character, L. B. Jeffries, is a photo-journalist who has been injured while taking photos during an auto race.  Confined to his full leg cast, he spends six weeks in his apartment with nothing better to do than observe the neighborhood outside his rear window.  In the process, he and his girlfriend Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) get involved in a wonderful murder mystery. \n"}, {"text": "In the film 'The Shining', the young boy Danny Torrence repeatedly says two words that when spelled backwards reveal a menacing term.

In one scene, he frightens his oft-frightened mother Wendy (portrayed by Shelley Duvall) by warning her of his father Jack's (Jack Nicholson) plan to murder the both of them.  Danny writes the words 'red rum' on a wall, and his mother sees them in a mirror as 'murder'. \n"}, {"text": "In the Spike Lee film 'Do the Right Thing', one prominent character named Radio Raheem has a pair of full knuckle rings that bear what two opposite words?", "correct": "Love and hate", "options": ["Life and death", "Good and evil", "Black and white"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLove and hate.\n\n\tRadio Raheem, played by Bill Nunn, is one of the initiators of conflict and tension within the Brooklyn neighborhood in which this film takes place.

While speculation is rampant in the film about what the term means, the viewer learns at the end that Rosebud is simply the name of Kane's childhood sled.  Speculation persists about the 'real life' meaning of the term Rosebud, but I shan't go into the sordid details, leaving such investigations up to those intrepid few among you who wish to venture out on your own. \n"}, {"text": "'The Wizard of Oz' is one of those rare films that remains popular amongst both adults and children.

In a deleted scene, she also skywrote 'Eat at Joes', but the director felt that such advertisements would not be appropriate. (Just a joke!) \n"}, {"text": "In the movie 'Animal House', released in 1978, the John Belushi character Bluto Blutarsky wears a shirt that has become a fundamental part of American college culture.

In the 70 mm version of the film, this is the only appearance of the title, and there are no other credits.  The film was based roughly on the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, and features spoken poetry from T. S. Eliot (from 'The Hollow Men', specifically).  I could go on and on, really...the trivia possibilities for this film are endless. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1991 film 'Terminator II: Judgement Day', what are the two words that Sarah Connor carves into a picnic table in Mexico?", "correct": "No fate", "options": ["Zero chance", "Sudden death", "Live now"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo fate.\n\n\tThis two word phrase is something of a motto for the Sarah Connor character.
