They determine that the murderer entered through the back door, walked past the bedrooms, and decapitated the mother sitting in the living room.  He then returned to the bedroom with the intent of murdering the husband.  The man was attacked, but he managed to run down the hall before the killer finally used a single-edged knife to put him to a stop.

When a piece of paper with a shoe print on it is run through a computer, a piece of a logo for SunStar Auto Rental is found, and the CSIs determine that the paper is from an auto rental company at Miami International Airport.

They match up the orange and purple fibers to a colour scheme used by Maybach Air and determine that the name of the driver was Nick Murdock.  When they find the car, they find a blood stain on the steering wheel and the lot employee gives them a copy of Nick's driver's license.

Horatio realizes that although the address on the ticket is for 702 Star Island, the victims were at 720 Star Island. Penrod was at the wrong house, so Horatio calls the Miami Crime Lab and finds that the owner of 702 Star Island is named Michael Hanover Sr. and he also has a residence on 5th Avenue in New York City, so they check his luxurious apartment and follow a trail of blood to Hanover's and his wife's dead bodies in the bedroom and the study.

Meanwhile Stella checks the entrance that was used by Penrod and finds blood along the wall. They decide to take the lock apart to see how Penrod entered the room and they find no scratches inside it.  However, red acrylic shavings were found when the lock was observed, so they determined that a duplicate key was used to unlock the door.

Mac looks over the photos that Stella took earlier while Horatio checks the bodies of the parents. They both discover that there are hilt marks from the knife on the parents, but none on the son.  This shows that there were two knives involved, and there could've been two attackers, but they only have one knife.

The tassel was cut off the sleeve of the doorman's uniform when he tried to wipe the blood off the hiltless knife.  After stabbing Hanover Jr., the doorman simply dropped the knife down between the elevator doors, and the tassel fell in with it.  It turns out that the doorman was in Hanover Sr.'s will because he saved his life. \n"}, {"text": "Penrod killed the Hanovers.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe doorman hired Penrod to kill the Hanovers for a half of his earnings from the will.  When he took down the Miami address, he wrote it down wrong because he's dyslexic.  This caused him to kill the wrong family.  He also killed Murdock for the identity, but this also brought him down because he killed an undercover cop. When the Hanovers returned to Manhattan, the doorman took the key and copied it.  He went to the apartment with Penrod and decided to attack the son.  He left him alive to take the suspicion off of himself.  The murderers are arrested, Hanover inherits millions and gets Renee, and Horatio heads back to Miami where Laura realizes she's safe. \n"}]}
