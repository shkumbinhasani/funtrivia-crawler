{"id": "168181", "name": "Hardest Film History of Kevin Costner Trivia Quiz | Celebrities | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Celebrity Trivia", "    Celebrities C-D", " Kevin Costner"], "questions": [{"text": "A now common trivia question in coffee table conversation, it seems to be a must for any quiz dedicated to Kevin Costner.  In what 1983 film did he have a bit part from which he was later cut?", "correct": "The Big Chill", "options": ["Testament", "Night Shift", "Table for Five"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Big Chill.\n\n\tCostner indeed appeared in 'Testament', 'Table for Five' and 'Night Shift' (1982), all bit parts.  He was set to appear as a dead guy in 'The Big Chill', the 1983 ode to baby boomers everywhere, but his scenes were later cut by director Lawrence Kasdan.  Kasdan would later make up for this. \n"}, {"text": "Kevin Costner really began making a name for himself with his eccentric performance as Jake in the movie 'Silverado'.  Which of the following was not a co-star with Costner in that film?", "correct": "Dennis Quaid", "options": ["Kevin Kline", "Danny Glover", "Scott Glenn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDennis Quaid.\n\n\tDanny Glover appeared as Mal Johnson, Kevin Kline as Paden, and Scott Glenn as Emmett, Jake's brother.  The film also featured the acting talents of John Cleese, Jeff Goldblum, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt and Rosanna Arquette.  It seems that Lawrence Kasdan included Costner as a 'make up' for editing him out of 'The Big Chill'.  He can't have been disappointed. \n"}, {"text": "It was probably during the year 1987 that Costner officially established himself as a leading man in Hollywood.  His films that year included 'No Way Out' and 'The Untouchables'.  What was his character name in 'The Untouchables'?", "correct": "Eliot Ness & Elliot Ness & Ness & Eliot & Elliot", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEliot Ness & Elliot Ness & Ness & Eliot & Elliot.\n\n\tIn 1987's 'The Untouchables', Costner takes on the Chicago mobs, led by Al Capone (played memorably by Robert De Niro).  Costner gets added help from Sean Connery, who plays his assistant Jim Malone, and Andy Garcia, who portrays Agent George Stone (aka Giuseppe Petri).  This was really one of Costner's best pieces of work, I thought. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Kevin Costner films was not themed on the sport of baseball?", "correct": "Tin Cup", "options": ["Field of Dreams", "Bull Durham", "For Love of the Game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTin Cup.\n\n\tCostner is a big baseball fan, even appearing as the announcer of Major League Baseball's All-Century Team in 1999 during the All-Star game in Boston.  'Tin Cup' was a movie centered around golf...a less exciting sport, in my opinion. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these statements of belief made by Kevin Costner's character Crash Davis in 'Bull Durham' turned out to contradict his work in a later film?", "correct": "That Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone", "options": ["Opening your presents Christmas morning instead of Christmas eve", "That the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent crap", "That there ought to be a constitutional amendment outlawing Astroturf and the designated hitter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.\n\n\tIn the 1991 film 'JFK', directed by Oliver Stone, Costner plays Jim Garrison, a prosecutor who attempts to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone! \n"}, {"text": "Kevin Costner won an Oscar for both his directing and acting in the 1990 film 'Dances with Wolves'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tCostner did win two Oscars for 'Dances with Wolves', Best Director and Best Picture.  He was nominated for Best Actor, but did not take home the award, which went to Jeremy Irons for his work in 'Reversal of Fortune'. Up to and including his work in 2004's 'Open Range', these were still Costner's only Oscar nominations. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Kevin Costner films was not directed by Kevin Reynolds?", "correct": "The Bodyguard", "options": ["Waterworld", "Fandango", "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Bodyguard.\n\n\tApparently, these two worked well together up until 'Waterworld'.  'Fandango' was an early Costner film, from 1985...their first collaboration.  In 1991 they teamed up again for 'Robin Hood', a moderately interesting film.  'Waterworld', a 1995 film that lost a ton of money (it was the most expensive film ever produced prior to 'Titanic'), seemingly ended their collaboration together.  Apparently Reynolds walked off the set of the film a couple weeks prior to the ending of production and Costner was forced to finish directing it.  Costner was not officially credited with its direction. \n"}, {"text": "In which film does Costner play a member of the Kennedy family?", "correct": "Neither of these", "options": ["Both of these", "Thirteen Days", "JFK"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeither of these.\n\n\tIn the Oliver Stone film 'JFK', as already mentioned, Costner plays a lawyer named Garrison.  In 'Thirteen Days', Costner plays an advisor to President Kennedy named Kenny O'Donnell. \n"}, {"text": "Kevin Costner acted in, directed and produced the film 'The Postman', which appeared in cinemas in 1997.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIndeed, Costner filled all of these rolls for 'The Postman', another film that performed not so stunningly at the box office.  In 'The Postman', Costner's character was simply called 'The Postman', while in 'Waterworld', he was credited as 'Mariner'.  Maybe the lesson for these two films is that Costner's characters need actual names? \n"}, {"text": "In the marvelous 2003 film 'Open Range', Costner plays Charley Waite, a gunslinger from the old west.  Who plays his partner Boss Spearman in the film?", "correct": "Robert Duvall", "options": ["Gene Hackman", "Dustin Hoffman", "Clint Eastwood"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Duvall.\n\n\tThis is really a terrific western, one of Costner's best films, and actually one of his best acting performances as well!  Duvall should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and I also believe Annette Bening, who plays Costner's love interest Sue Barlow, should have gotten a supporting actress nod.  Regardless...let's hope Costner keeps churning out the excellent work.  Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some of my other stuff. \n"}]}
