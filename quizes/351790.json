{"id": "351790", "name": "Never Surrender Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "\"Never give up! Never surrender!\" is the motto of a very motley crew indeed. They're the ageing stars of an old sci-fi television show, now reduced to reciting catchphrases for their adoring, geeky fans. And then, suddenly, the aliens arrive to take them to their starship, and the actors are expected to make a desperate last stand real. What's the name of the movie?", "correct": "Galaxy Quest", "options": ["Star Wars", "Star Trek", "Serenity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalaxy Quest.\n\n\t\"Galaxy Quest\" (1999) shares its name with the fictional TV show that the aliens, who have no concept of lying or pretending, have mistaken for \"historical documents.\" Accordingly, they've built a real starship based on on information gleaned from the show, and now they want the original crew -- including Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman -- to take charge of their negotiations with their mortal enemies. \r Since the original crew aren't actually intrepid explorers of outer space, things quickly go wrong. A desperate last stand, after the ship has been boarded, gives the bickering actors one shot at redemption -- and one chance to make that motto real. \n"}, {"text": "Even before the 2006 movie \"300\", this last stand had been remembered and celebrated for some 2500 years. In a mountain pass called Thermopylae, 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans stood against the advance of what invading army?", "correct": "The Persians", "options": ["The Mongols", "The Huns", "The Romans"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Persians.\n\n\tLed by their emperor, Xerxes I, the Persian army (from modern-day Iran) meant to add the bickering city-states of Greece to their realm. The suicidal stand at Thermopylae bought time for the other city-states to raise their own armies and navies, resulting in the eventual defeat of the Persians at Salamis and Plataea.\r \"300\", based on a series of comic books by Frank Miller, did well at the box office despite its questionable historical accuracy. It did, however, repeat the Spartan king's famous response to the Persians' demand that he surrender and lay down his weapons: \"Come and get them.\" \n"}, {"text": "At the climax of this 1996 science-fiction film, as pilots around the world prepare, on the Fourth of July, for one last effort to defeat the alien invaders, an American president gives a speech. \"And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!\"\n\nThe speech alludes to the title of the movie. What is it?", "correct": "Independence Day", "options": ["The Day the World Spoke  ", "The Fourth of July", "Without a Fight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIndependence Day.\n\n\tThe hugely successful \"Independence Day\" set off a fad for movies in which large portions of the world are destroyed in gorgeous Technicolor. (The White House and the Eiffel Tower always receive particular attention in the destruction montages.) The space aliens of the movie were implacable, having no desire to negotiate or even leave any humans alive, and spent most of the movie in giant ships that were safe even from nuclear bombs.\r In an often-mocked sequence, a scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and a fighter pilot (Will Smith) use a stolen alien attack craft to plant a computer virus on the mother ship. (Because the whole galaxy uses Microsoft Windows, apparently.) This virus brings down the shields on alien ships all over the world, allowing the last remaining wave of fighter pilots to find the weak spot and destroy the enemy. Soon after the speech, the president (Bill Pullman) hops into a jet himself. I just hope he found his own speech inspirational! \n"}, {"text": "Not all last stands succeed. In the second act of the 2012 film \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", a large group of characters constructs a barricade and fights against an uncaring government. Which of these revolutionaries does NOT die at the barricade?", "correct": "Marius", "options": ["Eponine", "Enjolras", "Gavroche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarius.\n\n\tThe movie hews closely to its source material, a 1980 musical that is based in turn on the 1862 novel by Victor Hugo. Enjolras, the leader of the student revolutionaries, dies in the final push of the attempted 1832 revolution, as it becomes clear that the people of Paris are not going to rise up with them. Gavroche, an adorable ragamuffin, is shot while scavenging for the revolutionaries. Eponine, a young woman in unrequited love with Marius, dies to save him. Marius survives the deaths of all his friends solely due to the intervention of Jean Valjean, the adoptive father of his beloved Cosette and the protagonist of the movie. The haunting song \"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\" is Marius's tribute to the fallen:\r \"Here they dreamed about tomorrow -- but tomorrow never came.\" \n"}, {"text": "Toward the end of the 2007 movie \"I Am Legend,\" scientist Robert Neville is holed up in his lab, fending off a band of post-human attackers. How is his last stand resolved, in the final version of the film?", "correct": "He kills himself and his attackers with a grenade.", "options": ["He discovers a way to communicate with his attackers and settle their differences.", "He is finally taken down after a long fight, and is killed by the leader of the attack.", "He defeats his attackers and escapes alive."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe kills himself and his attackers with a grenade.\n\n\tNeville (Will Smith) has a reason for this suicidal move: a woman and a boy are hiding inside a coal chute, and he's just given them a vial with the cure for the pandemic that created the post-humans. By destroying his attackers, he allows the others to escape with the cure - sacrificing his life and becoming a legend to the survivors of humanity.\r The film was based on a 1954 book of the same name, written by Richard Matheson. The ending marks a significant departure from the book, which actually ended with Neville's realization that the post-humans (who are sort of vampiric zombies) are not mindlessly evil creatures, but people trying to build a real society. In capturing and killing them to hunt for a cure, he's become the very thing he thought he was fighting - a terrifying bedtime story for children, a legend of an outsider enemy. The original ending to the movie version (found on the DVD release) featured a similar reversal, in which Neville realizes that his attackers are actually trying to rescue his latest lab specimen. He returns the woman, and nobody dies. \n"}, {"text": "Two action thrillers, one from 1976 and one from 2005, have the title \"Assault on Precinct 13\" and hinge on the siege of a police station. There are a lot of differences, though. Which of these is true of BOTH movies?", "correct": "Cops and criminals must work together to defend the station.", "options": ["The action unfolds in the city of Los Angeles.", "The people attacking the station are led by a corrupt cop.", "In the end, the conflict is settled through words, not bullets."], "explanation": "\n\n\nCops and criminals must work together to defend the station.\n\n\tThe 1976 villains are a Los Angeles gang, who have chased a vigilante citizen to the station. In 2005, the bad guys are Detroit police officers led by a corrupt captain, trying to kill a warlord prisoner before he can testify about their involvement in his schemes. In both scenarios, the officers of Precinct 13 are forced to arm the criminals on a prison bus that was diverted to the station. Cops and crooks stand shoulder-to-shoulder in a seemingly doomed effort to hold out until help can arrive. The body count is high, but both movies have a happy ending (at least, for a few survivors).\r Perhaps the sole piece of cleverness in the later film is that its criminal protagonist has the same last name as the cop protagonist from the first film: Bishop, the chess piece that moves diagonally. \n"}, {"text": "As last stands go, the one from \"Serenity\" is pretty harrowing: the crew of a small ship is holding off a mob of crazed and bloodthirsty Reavers, buying time for their captain to broadcast a dangerous secret to the galaxy. One of the crew is already dead in this fight; two more are wounded; and the blast doors to their bolthole won't close from the inside. In what television show were viewers first introduced to these desperately reluctant heroes?", "correct": "Firefly", "options": ["Angel", "Dollhouse", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFirefly.\n\n\tThe sci-fi show \"Firefly\" aired for only half a season in 2002, but its fan base was so devoted that Universal agreed to make the 2005 follow-on movie \"Serenity\". In it, our heroes uncover horrific crimes committed by the government of the interplanetary Alliance -- all in the name of the greater good, of course -- and fight terrible odds to blow the whistle.One friend and former crew member is killed well before the final showdown; another falls in the first moments of the confrontation. But the resolution of the last stand is a beautiful moment of character growth. My tissue box always gets a good workout! \n"}, {"text": "With a title like \"They Died with Their Boots On\", you know that things are not going to go well for the movie's main characters -- but then, you may know that from history, too. What ill-fated U.S. officer does Errol Flynn play in this vaguely historical 1941 picture?", "correct": "George Custer", "options": ["Winfield Scott", "Ulysses Grant", "John Pershing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge Custer.\n\n\tCuster trained at the United States Military Academy in West Point, but graduated last in his class - a feat often noted by people studying his disastrous Last Stand, in which his entire command was killed in the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. The movie \"They Died with Their Boots On\" takes some interesting liberties with the story. In this version, both the victors at Little Bighorn - the Lakota Sioux, Arapaho, and Northern Cheyenne peoples - and Custer's battalion were victims of some complex dirty dealings between white politicians and white corporations. Flynn's Custer sacrifices his battalion knowingly, hoping to avert all-out war on a mission to \"hell or glory. It depends on one's point of view.\"\r This rather romanticized version of history did quite well for Warner Brothers at the time, and is still enjoyed by classic film buffs. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Harry Potter\" series is chock-a-block with climactic fight scenes, but the ultimate showdown comes in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2\" (2011). Here, the evil Voldemort and all his army face off against the Order of the Phoenix and other defenders of truth and justice in wizarding Britain, while Harry and his friends pursue the final Horcruxes. Where do Harry's supporters make their last stand?", "correct": "Hogwarts", "options": ["King's Cross Station", "The Ministry of Magic", "Privet Drive"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHogwarts.\n\n\tHogwarts, the British Isles' sole school of witchcraft and wizardry, is a focal point of the series: each of the first six books and movies corresponds to one year of Harry's time as a student there. So it's a shock for longtime fans to see the school become a war zone, a haven invaded by destruction and death. Many beloved characters fall in the defense of Hogwarts, but surrender is never an option: rule by Voldemort would mean suffering and death for far too many. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Return of the King\" (2003), the final movie of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, last stands abound. The great city of Gondor is surrounded by the seemingly invincible forces of Sauron, and the only hope for ultimate victory is a pair of hobbits slowly carrying a ring to a volcano. Which of the following characters is NOT involved in the fight for Gondor?", "correct": "Arwen", "options": ["Merry", "Aragorn", "\u00c9owyn"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArwen.\n\n\tArwen, the half-elf love of Aragorn (the \"king\" of the title), is ill in her father's home of Rivendell, but she does set useful events in motion and marries her beloved at the end of the film, which is based on the conclusion of the novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. \u00c9owyn, a princess of the Riders of Rohan, disguises herself as a man in order to take part in the battle, and ends up slaying the Witch King.(Merry, a hobbit, assists.) And, of course, Aragorn is in the thick of things, arriving on the battlefield at the head of (no kidding!) an Army of the Dead. It's a delight to watch the pieces come together, and a hopeless situation turn victorious.There's still the little matter of the poor hobbits at Mount Doom, however... \n"}]}
