{"id": "379268", "name": "This is the End, Or Is It? Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "As each movie in this series wrapped up, someone would inevitably be taken away by an invisible demon affectionately named 'Toby'... but what was the first film in the franchise?", "correct": "Paranormal Activity", "options": ["Devil's Due", "The Last Exorcism", "The Devil Within"], "explanation": "\n\n\nParanormal Activity.\n\n\t\"Paranormal Activity\", released in 2007, became a pop culture phenomenon and independent film success story due to its unique approach to a modern ghost story, and while it ended up ending on a cliffhanger, it also ended up resulting in several sequels, some less inspired than others, expanding on the mythology established in the first. All of them involved ghostly demons and most involved children being wooed into danger, but one thing viewers could always rely on was a tendency not to leave things wrapped up.  And what with several jumps back and forth in time... it took six films to get things straightened out, I guess. \n"}, {"text": "In 1991, the sixth installment in what horror franchise was titled \"Freddy's Dead\"?", "correct": "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "options": ["Hellraiser", "Leprechaun", "Child's Play"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\n\tAlthough this sixth film in which Freddy Krueger obviously returned to haunt the dreams of twenty-something actors playing helpless teenagers promised to knock off Freddy for good, it only took three more years before Wes Craven directed \"New Nightmare\", an almost meta sequel about Krueger haunting the real Heather Langenkamp (who starred in the first and third films of the series).  Freddy also appeared in \"Freddy Vs. Jason\" and a Platinum Dunes remake in 2010.  I guess it's hard to keep killing something that's already dead... \n"}, {"text": "While the original killer had his neck sliced open by the titular tool at the end of the third movie, the games continued in what long-running horror franchise featuring deadly traps?", "correct": "Saw", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaw.\n\n\tThat's right.  While The Jigsaw Killer had a terminal illness in all three of the first \"Saw\" movies, he met his end at the hand of a circular sawblade in \"Saw III\" and reappeared in flashbacks in the next four movies to teach his helpers and some seemingly-deserving people to embrace life and pay penance for their misdeeds.  Suffice to say, every time one movie ended, something would come up; someone would get away; more games would need to be played.  \"Saw 3D: The Final Chapter\", the seventh movie in the series, was released in 2010.  It ended with a cliffhanger. \n"}, {"text": "What demon-themed series, originally set in a cabin in the woods, never really ended... even when the protagonist's hand was cut off (only to be replaced by a chainsaw)?", "correct": "The Evil Dead", "options": ["Cabin in the Woods", "Cabin Fever", "The Cottage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Evil Dead.\n\n\tAsh Williams (Bruce Campbell) went head-to-head against the demonic forces of the Necronomicon in the first... and second... and third films in the \"Evil Dead\" series started by Sam Raimi, and it goes without saying that the end of the films never really stuck, especially since the movies, which sent Ash back into the medieval past, resulted in a TV show sequel/revival in 2015 called \"Ash Vs. the Evil Dead\", airing on the U.S. cable network Starz.\rThe original \"Evil Dead\" was also banned in the UK... not that it stopped production of a sequel.\rOh yeah, and the original \"Evil Dead\" was remade in 2013.  Go figure. \n"}, {"text": "\"The Final Chapter\" was hardly the last movie in what long-running film franchise about a machete-wielding revenant?", "correct": "Friday the 13th", "options": ["Wrong Turn", "Hatchet", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday the 13th.\n\n\tWhile \"Friday the 13th\" was expected to end with this fourth part in 1984, the continued popularity of the franchise throughout the 1980s ended up pushing producers to keep bringing it back.  Even though this fourth movie, starring a young Corey Feldman, brought Jason Voorhees back from the... dead?... again to bother the residents of Camp Crystal Lake (who wouldn't just move) and the film ended with the bad guy being beheaded, the fifth movie, \"Jason Lives\", came out the following year, bringing him back again... and again... and again. Even after Jason went into space in 2002's \"Jason X\", it took a cross-over with Freddy Krueger before he appeared in a Platinum Dunes remake in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "Burning down a house isn't enough to stop a haunting.  This adage holds true in what Japanese-influenced horror franchise involving a host that wouldn't stop spreading its rage?", "correct": "The Grudge", "options": ["The Ring", "Pulse", "One Missed Call"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Grudge.\n\n\t\"The Grudge\" (2004), originally released as \"Ju-On\" in Japan, involved ghosts created by people who killed out of rage, so when a family was killed its members had no real choice but to extend their suffering on to as many people as possible over several films.  At the end of the first movie, Sarah Michelle Gellar burnt the house down, but that did little to stop the curse.  By the end of the third film in the American series, the Grudge had traveled to Chicago.  The Japanese series eventually pitted the main ghost, Kayako, against the girl from \"The Ring\" (\"Ringu\", in Japan), Sadako. \n"}, {"text": "No one can escape death, especially those in what series of films in which people escaped their own deaths only to die, later on, in more imaginatively gruesome ways?", "correct": "Final Destination", "options": ["They", "Death's Door", "The Thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFinal Destination.\n\n\tAnd with this series there would be no final \"Final Destination\" for the audience.  While some movies in this series about escaping one's own predetermined fate did see survivors, those who lived ended up getting killed in horribly imaginative ways in later movies - even those who lived in some died in deleted scenes from others.  In the original film in the series, a group of teenagers survived a plane crash only to find themselves on the run from a seemingly omnipotent Death.  Several sequels followed, some in 3D. \n"}, {"text": "Released in 1968, what George A. Romero horror film was followed by a \"Dawn\", \"Day\", and \"Land\", all in the same series?", "correct": "Night of the Living Dead", "options": ["Return of the Living Dead", "The Crazies", "The Evil Dead"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Living Dead.\n\n\t\"Night of the Living Dead\", one of the seminal films in the zombie horror genre, was somewhat decried after its release in 1968 but has since become one of the most famous (and, arguably, most important) horror films of the 1960s; it's been added to the U.S. National Film Registry.  The movie, about a group of people hiding in a farmhouse during a zombie outbreak, soon passed into the public domain but Romero (and others) released the sequels \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Day of the Dead\", \"Land of the Dead\", \"Diary of the Dead\", and \"Survival of the Dead\" in later years. A spin-off series, \"Return of the Living Dead\", was also released in the 1980s. \n"}, {"text": "Nearly each film of what Don Coscarelli-directed series ended with the Tall Man reappearing, and something pulling the main character through a mirror or window?", "correct": "Phantasm", "options": ["Dagon", "Re-Animator", "The Hills Have Eyes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhantasm.\n\n\tCoscarelli began the \"Phantasm\" series back in 1979 and continued it across several decades, bringing back the same cast to reprise their roles throughout the horror sequels, even if they'd been killed in earlier films.  All of the movies feature a small contingent of people lashing out against the Tall Man, whose motives involved an extra dimension.  Each movie ended on somewhat of a cliffhanger, leaving the viewer to assume that either something was a dream or that a major character wouldn't be out of trouble quite yet.  Angus Scrimm, who played the Tall Man, passed away in 2016. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of each film in this series, the victims had to shoot the killer(s) in the head to make sure they stayed dead.  What satirical horror series is it?", "correct": "Scream", "options": ["Scary Movie", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Urban Legend"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScream.\n\n\t\"Scream\" (1996) was a Wes Craven classic from the get-go, almost single-handedly reviving the long-dead (haha) teen slasher genre with a tongue-in-cheek parody of... well... teen slashers.  While the movie followed teenagers (and others) dealing with a ghost-faced killer amongst them, it also poked fun at typical horror conventions and seemingly game-changed horror over the coming years. Each movie in the series seemed to end with the killer(s) rising from being shot... and needing to be shot again to stay dead.  This, of course, is something that was brought up on more than one occasion.  The movies starred Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courteney Cox. \n"}]}
