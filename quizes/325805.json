{"id": "325805", "name": "\"Throwdown\" Multiple Choice Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 1 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 1"], "questions": [{"text": "Which member of the Glee Club requests more 'black music' from Mr. Schuester?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Artie", "Kurt", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tThe episode begins with Sue and Will arguing (in slow motion).  While Will is against this idea, Sue finds this to be a moment of triumph and regality.  It all started when Principal Figgins set Sue up as co-director of New Directions after the debacle in the previous episode.  While Will asks the kids for suggestions as to what type of music they partake in for their sectional snubber, Sue gets her Cheerios, Quinn, Santana, and Brittany, to help her pit the kids against one another. Quinn reports back suggesting that she target the minority kids who feel left out.  Sue agrees that this is a great idea. While talking to Figgins, Sue and Will outline their plans to create individual numbers and flip a coin to perform each one.  It turns out that they have ulterior motives though. \n"}, {"text": "How do Sue and Will determine who sings first in their Glee battle?", "correct": "Flip a coin", "options": ["Rock, Paper, Scissors", "Draw straws", "Take a vote"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFlip a coin.\n\n\tQuinn goes to the doctor's office for an ultrasound with Finn to ensure that the baby is healthy.  Both discover that their child will be a girl.  Back in the waiting room, Finn talks with Will who has brought them both for the appointment.  Finn is disappointed with all of the worry involved.  Back at school, Rachel runs into the student who runs the school newspaper (and has a crush on her).  He informs her that he has insider info stating that Quinn is pregnant, and Rachel finally acknowledges the truth in order to prevent him from printing the story. She asks what she can do to prevent it.  Later, Sue rigs a coin toss to get the first pick for her number for New Directions (by buying a double-headed coin).  According to the show choir rule book, she states, she can split up the group; as long as all members perform during the competition, they can divide them up if they so choose. She does this, claiming it to be the Sue Sylvester way. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these kids does Sue not make one of 'Sue's Kids'?", "correct": "Rachel", "options": ["Tina", "Santana", "Kurt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRachel.\n\n\tDubbing her side an 'elite group', Sue selects everyone but Rachel, Puck, Brittany, Finn, and Quinn to form a new Glee performance.  Essentially, she picks out all of the visible minorities, leaving Will with only five of the twelve kids.  Frustrated, Will returns home for dinner and expresses himself to Terri. Although she sits on the phone at the dinner table talking to her sister, Will tells her that he doesn't want to feel as powerless in his own home as he does at the school; in fact, the first time he went to an appointment for a baby, it was with Finn and Quinn.  He vows, next time she has an appointment, he's going. At school, Finn thanks Rachel for the work that she's done in preventing the Quinn story from reaching the public and tells her that he'll find a way to make it up to her.  When Rachel turns around, she finds herself face to face with Jacob, the school reporter, who yells at her for giving him a pair of new panties (the tag is still on the pair she handed over).  He states that unless she pays up, he's running the story. \n"}, {"text": "According to Sue, what is one small part of her heritage?", "correct": "Comanche Indian", "options": ["Canadian", "Dutch", "Slavic"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComanche Indian.\n\n\tAlthough 'Sue's Kids' are a bit apprehensive about her organizing their number, Mercedes notes that the 'Sue's Corner' segment she used the previous night was about minorities and that she probably won't be giving them anything difficult based on it.  When she comes in with the brass band, Sue hands the kids several copies of Jill Scott's \"Hate on Me\" to express their frustration under Will's regime and she lets them go to town with it (and Mercedes' vocals).  After the practice, Will talks to Sue on her way out of the building saying that they need to get their problems out in the open. Sue claims that she has been attempting to destroy Glee Club with a religious conviction because she can't trust men with curly hair and because she needs to protect her legacy. \n"}, {"text": "Mr. Schuester finds a suitable way to get back at Sue through the Cheerios.  What does he do to hinder Sue's practices?", "correct": "He flunks them", "options": ["He sends them to detention", "He cancels their field time", "He uses the field for Glee practice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe flunks them.\n\n\tAt home, Terri apologizes for the way she's been acting and gives a suggestion as to how Will can get back at Sue for the nasty things she's been doing.  When Sue arrives at the field in the morning, only Quinn, Santana, and Brittany have shown up for practice.  Will flunked the Cheerios out of his Spanish class making them academically ineligible to be members of the cheerleading squad. Sue brings Will to Principal Figgins.  Will is able to easily counter-argue though.  He brings Spanish test results in which students have been incapable of spelling their own name or answering multiple choice questions. Figgins agrees with Will; Sue needs to smarten up.  When Will departs, Sue threatens Figgins by saying that she'll post a certain Youtube video of him, but it turns out he already uploaded it himself, giving her no leverage in the situation. \n"}, {"text": "What is the baby name that Finn thinks of for Quinn's child?", "correct": "Drizzle", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrizzle.\n\n\tIn Spanish, Finn passes Quinn a note explaining that he heard that Gwyneth Paltrow named her kid Apple.  This got him thinking about the name of his and Quinn's child.  He proposes 'Drizzle'.  After class the two of them get into an argument about the baby and their relationship before Quinn simply tells him not to go around with Rachel.\rBefore Will's Glee practice with the remaining five kids, everyone gathers in the Choir Room to jam together to Nelly's \"Ride With Me\".  When Will arrives, they all say that they miss spending time practicing together, but they know that they have no option.\rWhen Will arrives, he sets his kids on their Sectionals performance: \"No Air\" by Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown.  While he claims to be promoting togetherness to oppose Sue's song about literal hating, Quinn states that giving the others the 'lead roles' sort of leaves them separated. \n"}, {"text": "Will purposely books an obstetrician appointment for Terri.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tQuinn goes straight to Sue with her doings during Glee practice.  After practicing \"No Air\" on stage, she comments that Will just wants the rest of them to sway in the back like props.  Sue orchestrates a scheme to turn Brittany and Puck, commenting on their minority statuses.  Inevitably, Puck (who is Jewish) and Brittany (who has Dutch heritage) join Sue's kids, leaving Will with three students.\rWhen Will returns home, he tells Terri how good he's feeling for standing up to Sue.  On this wave of excitement, he also notes that he booked an appointment for Terri so that he can be there to see the baby.  The following day, Terri has no choice but to go to her doctor's office (with sister, Kendra, in tow) to make sure that Will doesn't discover the truth.\rAt school, Will discovers what Sue did to his kids and holds true to his word not to pass the Cheerios. \n"}, {"text": "With whom does Quinn perform \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\"?", "correct": "The Cheerios", "options": ["She performs solo", "New Directions", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cheerios.\n\n\tQuinn approaches Rachel in the school hallway and tells her to back off from Finn.  Rachel admits her motives, but also notes that she is aware that Quinn is a mole for Sue. Quinn denies this, but Rachel continues that when push comes to shove, Sue only looks out for herself and someday, Quinn will need friends like the Glee Club because Sue will find out that she's pregnant and wreak havoc on her cheerleading career (and possibly her status in the school).  Turning away from Rachel, Quinn begins her rendition of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" by the Supremes (with the Cheerios in tow). \n"}, {"text": "According to Will, where did Sue get her PhD?", "correct": "Online", "options": ["Harvard", "A trash can", "She stole it from a doctor"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOnline.\n\n\tIn the gym, Rachel, Finn, and Quinn stand on stage to perform their rendition of \"No Air\" in front of Sue's Kids but before they can even start the music, Sue gets up to leave telling the rest to follow her out of the auditorium.  Before long, Will is expressing his feelings about Sue and we return to the same slow-motion sequence seen in the beginning of the episode.  Finn stops them though.  The kids, shocked at their teachers' arguing, leave the auditorium and end the fight.\rWill, stressed from work, arrives at Terri's appointment at which the doctor has agreed to orchestrate the big lie.  Eventually, Will sees a video of a baby that isn't his.  The doctor also says that they misread the sonogram originally; the boy is actually a girl.  Overwhelmed by the emotion, however, he sheds a tear. \n"}, {"text": "Sue discovers that Quinn is pregnant.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe next day, Will heads to Sue's office for a talk.  She says that she is stepping down as co-head of Glee Club but that she would like to stay on as a consultant in regards to the setlist choices before Sectionals.  She 'admits' that Glee Club is too fruity for her and that she can't stand the kids' emotions.\rIn Glee practice, Sue announces her stepping down as co-head, but admits that she knows that Quinn is pregnant...and that the story will be in blogs the following afternoon.  Rachel later discovers that Sue forced Jacob to run the story despite her intervention.  When she finds Quinn, Finn is consoling her during her crying.  The kids, on stage, perform Avril Lavigne's \"Keep Holding On\".  As the song ends, Quinn struggles to hold back her tears while the rest of New Directions stays at her side. \n"}]}
