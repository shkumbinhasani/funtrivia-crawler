{"id": "355548", "name": "Basic Cell Quiz 3: Plant Vs Animal | Sci / Tech | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Biology", "Cell and Molecular Biology"], "questions": [{"text": "This organelle is found primarily in plant cells. It is located outside the membrane and provides protection to the cell. What is this organelle?", "correct": "Cell Wall", "options": ["Ribosome", "Chloroplast ", "Endoplasmic Reticulum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCell Wall.\n\n\tThe cell wall is one of the structures that gives a plant cell its shape. Most plant cells when looked at under a microscope resemble small boxes packed closely together. An animal cell looks different. Under a microscope, animal cells appear circular and spread further apart. \n"}, {"text": "Plant and animal cells both contain membrane bound organelles. Which of the following is a term that would describe these cells?  ", "correct": "Eukaryotes", "options": ["Trykaryotes", "Prokaryotes", "All of these would accurately describe plant and animal cells. "], "explanation": "\n\n\nEukaryotes.\n\n\tThe term \"prokaryote\" would describe a cell that does not contain membrane bound organelles. An example are bacteria, which are unicellular organisms. \n"}, {"text": "This organelle is found mostly in animal cells. They are tubed shaped and located at right angles from one another. What organelle is this?", "correct": "Centrioles", "options": ["Golgi Apparatus ", "Ribosome ", "Cell Membrane "], "explanation": "\n\n\nCentrioles.\n\n\tThe centrioles help to organize cell division. They are the site were the spindle is formed. The spindle is the structure that pulls chromosomes apart during anaphase so that each new cell gets the same number and types of chromosomes. \n"}, {"text": "This organelle is found in both plant and animal cells. It provides energy to the cell and is where the aerobic processes of cellular respiration occur. What is this organelle? ", "correct": "Mitochondria", "options": ["Ribosome", "Chloroplast ", "Mitochondria ", "Lysosome "], "explanation": "\n\n\nMitochondria.\n\n\tCellular respiration is a cell process that provides energy to the body by breaking down glucose and creating ATP energy molecules. These molecules are needed for cells to perform their daily functions and keep the organism alive. \n"}, {"text": "This process occurs primarily in plant cells. Since plants are unable to obtain energy from other organisms, they must produce their own. Which process uses light and converts compounds into glucose to provide energy for plants?\n", "correct": "Photosynthesis", "options": ["Mitosis ", "Chemosynthesis ", "Photosynthesis ", "Cellular Respiration "], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhotosynthesis.\n\n\tPhotosynthesis and chemosynthesis are both processes that occur within plant cells. They both provide energy to the cells and plant in the form of glucose. However, chemosynthesis can occur within plants that are not exposed to light, using chemical energy as a driving force. Photosynthesis can only occur in the presence of light. \n"}, {"text": "This organelle is found in both plant and animal cells. Animal cells contain many small ones. Plant cells contain one large one that takes up most of the cell's volume. What is this organelle?\n", "correct": "Vacuole", "options": ["Golgi Apparatus ", "Lysosome ", "Vacuole ", "Mitochondria "], "explanation": "\n\n\nVacuole.\n\n\tVacuoles act as a cell's storage unit. Some of their functions include containing water and waste products produced by the cell and getting rid of unwanted material. The central vacuole takes up about 90 percent of the space inside of a plant cell. \n"}, {"text": "Lysosomes are found in both plant and animal cells. They are more abundant and easier to see in plant cells.  ", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tLysosomes are found in both plant and animal cells, however, there are more and they are easier to see in animal cells. Lysosomes break down a cell's waste material. \n"}, {"text": "Plastids are organelles found only in plant and algae cells.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPlastids are not found in animal cells. They create and store important compounds in plant cells. Some of these compounds are used during photosynthesis. \n"}, {"text": "Cilia are mostly found in animal cells. They can be found in plant cells but are very rare. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tCilia are organelles that are similar to flagella. They are both hair-like organelles on the cell's outside that help move a cell through a medium or move substances along it by moving back and forth. \n"}, {"text": "The cytoskeleton is found only in animal cells giving animals extra protection.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tAll cells have a cytoskeleton. It is located inside of the cell wall (Plants)and membrane giving plants and animals an extra layer of protection. This layer is needed in plants since plants are so fragile. The cytoskeleton is one of the structures that gives plant cells and the plant itself their shapes. \n"}]}
