When its headquarters in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood were no longer capacious enough for all its activities, the company announced a competition for its second headquarters - and some 238 North American cities and regions applied. What's the name of the company?", "correct": "Amazon", "options": ["Google", "Facebook ", "Walmart"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAmazon.\n\n\tAmazon nearly had a different moniker: Cadabra, a reference to magic tricks and items appearing out of thin air. Unfortunately, it also sounded gruesomely similar to the word \"cadaver,\" and founder Jeff Bezos ultimately took his lawyer's advice and changed the name. Incorporated in 1994, Amazon launched as an online bookstore in 1995 and soon expanded into other types of goods. By 2018 about 1 of every 20 U.S. retail dollars was spent on Amazon.\r In 2017, the company announced a competition to select the location of its second headquarters, promising billions in construction spending and some 50,000 jobs at the new location. The competition was fierce, with localities offering everything from free sandwiches to giant cacti. In early 2018 Amazon whittled the field down to 20 finalists. The final decision was anxiously awaited. \n"}, {"text": "Our next company is also the youngest in the quiz. Founded in 2006 by the same people who founded Expedia, this company built a massive online real-estate database to take some of the legwork out of house-hunting. What's the name of this company, offering services from home-value Zestimates to processing of rental payments?", "correct": "Zillow", "options": ["Facebook", "Blue Nile", "Go Daddy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZillow.\n\n\tZillow's founders, former Microsoft executives Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink, were looking for a new challenge after selling off Expedia - and they were also looking for new homes. In their frustration at the difficulty of finding solid information on available real estate, they realized there would be a strong market for house hunting on the information superhighway, and Zillow was born. The somewhat silly name was chosen to be unique, memorable and evocative both of data (zillion) and comfort (pillow).\r Zillow makes it simple to browse houses and apartments in a neighborhood, and then contact people who can help make the transaction happen. I can say from experience that looking at the listings and photos is a great way to start figuring out what you want in a home! \n"}, {"text": "The Fremont neighborhood of Seattle is home to Theo Chocolate, just up the street from the statue of Lenin. How did \"the first organic and fair-trade chocolate factory in North America\" get its name?", "correct": "From the scientific name of the cacao tree", "options": ["From its street address", "From the founder's nickname ", "From the initials of the first four workers "], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrom the scientific name of the cacao tree.\n\n\tCocoa beans, the primary raw ingredient of chocolate, are the seeds of Theobroma cacao, an evergreen tree that grows well in tropical regions. The quoted description of Theo's business practices comes from the company's website; \"organic\" means that the farmers avoid synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, while \"fair trade\" means that Theo takes responsibility for paying the farmers equitably for the raw product. Theo Chocolate, founded in 2006,  takes pride in its \"bean to bar\" system and its direct relationship with farmers around the world.\r The chocolate is made at the Seattle factory; you can smell the place a few blocks away, depending on the wind. The completed bars are distributed around the US. In my opinion, Theo's chocolate bars fully deliver on the etymological promise of the name Theobroma - food of the gods. \n"}, {"text": "These days, this parcel delivery service is headquartered in Atlanta and active all over the world. But in 1907, it was a fledgling messenger company in - you guessed it - Seattle. Back then, the company didn't have any trucks or vans, let alone brown ones! What delivery giant has its birthplace in Seattle?", "correct": "UPS", "options": ["FedEx", "DHL", "Blue Angels"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUPS.\n\n\tThe origin of UPS - then called the American Messenger Company - is an instantly recognizable Seattle startup story. Two teenagers, Claude Ryan and Jim Casey, started a business with big dreams, hard work, and a shoestring budget. The main contrast to the modern story is that, it being 1907, the boys couldn't operate out of a garage; instead, they housed the fledgling company in a basement.\r Thanks in part to a well-executed merger with a rival messenger company, the business started to use cars and motorcycles for delivery in 1913. In 1918, the company expanded beyond Seattle (to Oakland, California), adopted its modern name (United Parcel Service, or UPS), and painted its delivery fleet brown. Many more changes were to come over the years, but the shape of the modern company was already recognizable. \n"}, {"text": "Starbucks may seem to be everywhere these days, but in 1971 it started with just one store in Seattle. Its retail offerings were a bit different, too. What is the one thing that was sold at the fledgling Starbucks?", "correct": "Roasted coffee beans", "options": ["Pastries ", "Flavored tea bags", "Hot chocolate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoasted coffee beans.\n\n\tStarbucks - named after a character in \"Moby Dick\" by founders Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker - was initially a purveyor of whole roasted beans, not brewed coffee nor even grounds. It wasn't until 1984 that the company began to branch out into serving coffee ready to drink, at the behest of Howard Schultz. Three years later the company, now controlled by Schultz, expanded to other cities. They broke the 100-store mark in 1991, and had over 1000 stores by the end of 1996; by 2015, more than 20,000 Starbucks stores were serving coffee all over the world. \n"}, {"text": "Spun off from Microsoft in 1999, Expedia soon amassed a huge portfolio of websites in its chosen arena. On which of these industries does Expedia focus?", "correct": "Travel", "options": ["Personal finance ", "Educational software ", "Video gaming "], "explanation": "\n\n\nTravel.\n\n\tExpedia owns and operates numerous search engines and aggregators for hotels, airfares, apartment rentals, and so on. If you've ever searched for good flights on Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, or CheapTickets, you should know that (since at least 2015) they're all Expedia underneath. The company makes most of its money through hotel bookings - partly commissions and partly profit on hotel reservations that Expedia buys at bulk rates and then resells.\r Before it was spun off, Expedia was born as a division of Microsoft in 1996, in the Seattle suburb of Redmond. Microsoft itself has been headquartered in Redmond since 1979, but was actually first founded in Albuquerque. \n"}, {"text": "Recreational Equipment, Inc. - or REI - has been a Seattle institution since 1938. What was the company's first product?", "correct": "Ice axes", "options": ["Basketball hoops", "Trampolines", "Hot-air popcorn poppers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce axes.\n\n\tREI founders Lloyd and Mary Anderson loves the outdoors, but had trouble obtaining high-quality equipment in Seattle. In 1938 they began ordering ice axes directly from Austria via catalog, and soon their friends joined up with them to buy in bulk and get better prices. Collecting $1 membership fees, they set up a cooperative with warehousing in their attic and retail off a dedicated shelf at a local grocer.\r Eventually the company expanded its offerings to serve a wider range of adventurers: novices and experts, on the water and in the mountains and everywhere in between, setting off on casual day trips or serious expeditions. REI now handles some $2 billion in revenue each year, but it's still a cooperative, and members receive dividends based on how much they spent in the last year. \n"}, {"text": "Since this Seattle-based webcomic launched in 1998, it has become a powerful force in the gaming world, with podcasts, the huge family of PAX conventions, and the Child's Play gaming charity. What's the name of the webcomic, and the empire?", "correct": "Penny Arcade", "options": ["xkcd", "The Order of the Stick", "Schlock Mercenary"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPenny Arcade.\n\n\tJerry Holkins writes the \"Penny Arcade\" webcomic, and Mike Krahulik illustrates it. In the highly episodic comic, the creators' alter egos, Tycho and Gabe, explore various aspects of video games and gaming culture, finding humor in anything from arcane gameplay mechanics to the dynamics of gaming groups. In 2004, they launched the wildly successful Penny Arcade Expo - later known simply as PAX - a Seattle gaming exposition that has since expanded its offerings to include annual events in Boston, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and Melbourne. The annual Child's Play charity drive, meanwhile, seeks to provide toys and games for children's hospitals, for the enjoyment of the patients.\r The incorrect answer choices are also webcomics, but none has achieved the multi-pronged success of Penny Arcade. \n"}, {"text": "These days, Nordstrom is a high-end department store selling everything from clothing to makeup to luggage. When it opened its doors as Wallin & Nordstrom in 1901, however, it only sold one type of thing. What was that?", "correct": "Shoes", "options": ["Perfume ", "Hats", "Jewelry "], "explanation": "\n\n\nShoes.\n\n\tJohn W. Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant with a sizable nest egg from the Klondike Gold Rush, partnered with Alaska buddy Carl Wallin to start a shoe store once they had both returned to Seattle. Wallin & Nordstrom built a reputation for service and quality, and that reputation continued to grow in the 1920s as they opened a second Seattle store, and as Nordstrom's sons took over the business.Now simply called Nordstrom, the company remained strictly shoe-focused until 1963. In that year Nordstrom bought Best's Apparel, and started branching out into clothing. Nowadays the retailer has numerous locations around the U.S. and Canada, and it's hard to imagine the stores selling nothing but shoes! \n"}, {"text": "First incorporated in Seattle in 1916, this aircraft manufacturer has maintained a substantial presence in the area for more than 100 years. Its factory in nearby Everett is the largest building in the world as measured by volume. What is the name of the company?", "correct": "Boeing", "options": ["Airbus", "Lockheed Martin ", "Rolls Royce"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoeing.\n\n\tThe Boeing Corporation took its name from its founder, William Boeing, who retooled a shipyard to produce airplanes. At that time, in the early 1910s, Seattle was an important transshipment point for the lumber industry, and the ready availability of wood (particularly spruce) made it a favorable spot for airplane construction as well. Through innovative aircraft design - and cultivation of wartime military contracts - the company swiftly became a powerhouse.\r The huge Boeing facility in Everett was built in 1966 on an absurd scale: 4.3 million square feet (398,000 square meters) with a footprint of nearly 100 acres (40 hectares). A jetliner assembly line takes quite a lot of space! It's possible to tour the structure if you're ever in the area; I highly recommend it. \n"}]}
