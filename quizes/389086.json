He's pursued for a small bit by a car until the driver sneaks up behind him on foot, chokes him out, and stuffs him into the trunk of his car.\r Elsewhere, Chris and Rose prepare for their trip.  They plan to head to Rose's parents' place for the first time.  Chris worries that his being black may cause a rift since he's her first black boyfriend, but she assures him that they're not racists.\r Soon, they're out on the road.  After a quick call to Chris' friend Rod, however, the two of them are horrified when something hits their car, breaking off a side mirror and landing in the woods adjacent to the road.  When Chris investigates, he finds that it's a deer.  The police are called, and they give a bit of a hard time before they continue on. \n"}, {"text": "Chris, as Rose's family discovers, is addicted to which of these?", "correct": "Cigarettes", "options": ["Alcohol", "Gambling", "Pills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCigarettes.\n\n\tAs Chris and Rose pull up to the Armitage household, they pass by a black man raking the lawn.  Rose assures him that he's a groundskeeper.  Soon, introductions are made on the front porch.  No one notices the groundskeeper watching from the distance.\r Chris is introduced to Dean and Missy-- Rose's parents-- and very quickly given a tour of the household.  Entering the kitchen, Chris briefly encounters Georgina, a black woman who appears to be a housekeeper.  Out in the backyard, Dean broaches the topic quickly-- white family, black housekeepers-- but the truth is that he hired them to take care of his ailing parents and couldn't bear leaving them without a job after all was said and done.  He knows how it looks, and that's that.\r During a talk out on the back porch, Dean realizes that Chris is jonesing for a cigarette and he encourages him to let Missy treat his addiction.  As a psychiatrist, she can use skillful hypnosis to remove the craving altogether.\r Since the family has a big get-together planned for the weekend, it's not long before Rose's brother, Jeremy, joins the family.  Soon, Chris learns some of the more embarrassing stories about his girlfriend.  Jeremy seems to be a bit of a character, but Chris brushes it off.  Rose apologizes for everything later on. \n"}, {"text": "With which of these objects is Missy able to hypnotize Chris?", "correct": "Teacup", "options": ["Pocketwatch", "Pen", "Flashlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTeacup.\n\n\tOn that first night, Chris can't sleep because he keeps thinking about the deer in the woods.  He decides to get up for a smoke and heads outside to do so, but some odd behaviours from Walter and Georgina spook him back into the house.  Missy, sitting in her office in the dark, catches him on the way back to the bedroom and encourages him to sit down with her. They both discuss his smoking, but the conversation soon turns to his mother, who died in a car accident when he was young.  Soon, without realizing it, Chris ends up in a heightened state of suggestion.  He cries as he talks to Missy and, before he knows it, he's sinking into the floor on her urging. She tells him he's in the sunken place before he awakens from the nightmare the next morning, back in his bed in Rose's room. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is Chris' profession?", "correct": "Photographer", "options": ["Writer", "Painter", "Singer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhotographer.\n\n\tChris heads out to take a few photos in the woods and returns to the house to find Walter chopping firewood.  Things take a weird turn when Chris introduces himself to the groundskeeper.  Later on, Chris remarks to Rose that Walter is a bit weird and may like her a bit more than he lets on.  He also says that her mother must have hypnotized him since he no longer has any interest in smoking cigarettes.\r The conversation ends quickly when a line of cars arrives at the house.  Things only get weirder at that point as many of the guests are either quite racist or else quite out of touch with societal norms.  Almost all of them are older.\r Chris spies one other black man at the party, Logan, and heads over to talk to him.  It proves severely awkward.  At one point, Chris moves in for a fist-bump; the man responds by shaking the fist.\r Chris finds a bit of comfort in finding someone who can speak to him a bit more passionately about mutual interests-- photography.  Blind art dealer Jim Hudson is at the party and happens to know Chris' work. \n"}, {"text": "According to Dean, what is the cause of Logan's 'seizure'?", "correct": "A flash of light", "options": ["Old age", "A repressed memory", "An allergic reaction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA flash of light.\n\n\tChris doesn't realize when he heads upstairs to check on his phone that the party stops talking in his absence.  Oddly, his phone is dead.  Someone unplugged it.  He expresses his concern to Rose, but she's a bit confused as to why anyone would do such a thing.  He ends up calling his buddy, Rod, who tells him to leave while he still can.\r As soon as Chris puts down the phone, he finds Georgina in the doorway, having come to apologize for accidentally disconnecting his phone charger.  They have a quick and confusing talk before he explains his discomfort with the white people downstairs and she sheds a tear before returning to normal.  She insists that she and Walter are treated like family.\r Chris returns to the party and Dean introduces him to a number of people including an Asian man who asks if he feels that African-Americans have more advantages or disadvantages in a modern world.  Chris isn't sure about answering.  As Logan passes by, Chris encourages him to answer and takes the opportunity to snap a photo of him.  Unfortunately, the flash is on on his phone, and this sparks something.  Soon, Logan's nose starts to bleed.  He rushes forward to Chris, grabbing him and urging him to get out while he still can.\r Dean blames this on a seizure.  Before long, he's fine again. \n"}, {"text": "Chris is sold at an auction during which the bidders placed their bids with which of the following?", "correct": "Bingo cards", "options": ["Sparklers", "Horseshoes", "Paddles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBingo cards.\n\n\tAs the party gets back on track with the promise of sparklers and Bingo, Rose takes Chris for a walk and they discuss what just happened.  Chris knows that Logan didn't have a seizure.  He tells Rose that he just needs to go.  It takes a bit of talking, but after Chris tells her the truth about his mother's passing, she decides to leave with him.\r While Chris and Rose are elsewhere, Dean holds an auction in the back yard, selling Chris off to the highest bidder.  As the guests place their bids using Bingo cards, Chris ends up being reserved for art dealer Jim Hudson.\r They return to the house at nightfall as the guests begin departing. \n"}, {"text": "The entire Armitage family is in on the scheme to capture Chris.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tChris sends the photo of Logan off to Rod who quickly calls back.  The photo of Logan?  Rod says it's a photo of Andre, a mutual acquaintance who went missing.  Because of this, it MUST be a sex slave situation.  Chris' phone battery dies mid-call, so when Rose comes in he tells her that they need to leave immediately.\r Rose heads out to get her bag and Chris notices the crawlspace door is open, like it was the night before.  This time, he checks inside and finds a box of pictures of Rose, often with past boyfriends...and girlfriends.  All of them were black.  The last two are of Walter and Georgina.\r Chris moves even faster to leave, but finds the front door is blocked by Jeremy, wielding a lacrosse stick.  Missy offers a cup of tea while Dean stalks about in an adjacent room, asking questions about purpose.\r When it becomes clear that Chris knows of her involvement, Rose reveals that she has the keys, but obviously can't give them over.  It only takes three taps on Missy's teacup to drop him to the floor with a hypnosis trigger.\r Chris sinks into the sunken place as Rose says that he was one of her favourites. \n"}, {"text": "Chris discovers that he's been determined to be a person sought out by an order known by what name?", "correct": "The Coagula", "options": ["The Croatoan", "The Chrysalid", "The Katydid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Coagula.\n\n\tThe next day, Rod has trouble getting through to Chris.  He heads to his apartment to feed Chris' dog, but there's still no answer from his cell.  Considering the events of the previous days though, there's something obviously amiss.  He decides to do a bit of research into Andre and discovers he's gone missing.\r Chris awakens in the basement of the house despite having been told that the basement was sealed off due to black mold.  He struggles with his leather straps before an old television set turns on.  It plays a video from Roman Armitage, a man who insists that his family has perfected a unique service in which one can combine a superior physical form with another mental form.  Chris has been chosen to allow another to partake in his physical gifts.\r The video switches to a new one in which a teacup is stirred.  Chris is immediately put back under. \n"}, {"text": "How is Chris able to avoid being hypnotized?", "correct": "By stuffing his ears", "options": ["By falling asleep", "By singing loudly", "By meditating"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy stuffing his ears.\n\n\tRod heads to the police station to ask about what can be done since Chris has been missing and has located Andre.  This proves to be a difficult sell since he basically boils down his theory to 'brainwashed sex slaves'.  Nonetheless, the detectives hear him out before sending him away.\r Rod calls Chris' phone one more time and Rose picks up, lying to him and saying that Chris left two days earlier in a cab.  He begins recording their call, but she doesn't give him any usable evidence.\r In the basement, Chris reawakens and a new video appears, this time showing Jim Hudson, and they're able to talk to each other via intercom.  Jim says that the hypnotism is used to sedate the patient and set up the body for the final stage of the process.  The final stage requires the transplanting of the mind into the donor body.  Essentially, a sliver of what Chris once was will be able to remain inside in the sunken place.  Jim will effectively be him.\r Chris has to ask the question-- why black people?  Black is simply 'in' for the process right now.  Jim wants Chris' artistic eyes.\r Soon, the teacup appears again, and in the operating room, Jim's scalp is opened.  Jeremy goes to retrieve Chris, but there's a trick up Chris' sleeve.  He stuffed his ears with chair stuffing to block out the sound of the teacup.  He picks up a hefty ball and attacks Jeremy with it, smashing it into the back of his skull. \n"}, {"text": "Does Chris escape the Armitage household?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWhen Jeremy doesn't return with Chris, Dean goes out to investigate.  Chris impales him with a deer trophy from the other room.  As he leaves, the operating room begins to catch fire.\r Chris heads upstairs, finding Georgina in the kitchen.  She runs.  In the next room, Missy makes a move to reach her teacup, but Chris swats it off the table before she can get it.  She grabs a letter opener instead, plunging it through his hand.  He braces himself and turns it round on her, stabbing her before heading to the front door.  Jeremy comes back and attacks him, but Chris gets the upper hand and leaves with his keys and cell phone.\r Chris calls 911, hitting Georgina with his car as he makes his escape.  Realizing that someone likely still exists inside the woman he hit, he decides to take her with him, sticking her in the passenger seat.  This turns out to be a bad move.  She attacks him and he drives the car into a tree, killing her.\r Rose finally realizes what's happened and leaves her burning house with a rifle.  Walter, who Rose refers to as Grandpa, chases him down and pins him to the ground, but Chris is able to take a photo of him, triggering the man inside to reemerge.  Walter asks Rose for the gun and she hands it over only to find herself on the receiving end.  He shoots her in the stomach before shooting himself in the head.\r Rose isn't dead though.  She reaches for the gun and grabs it as Chris begins to move again.  She claims to love him, but he strangles her as a siren sounds on the road behind them.  The lights from Rod's TSA car illuminate the road in red and blue as Chris hops in.  They drive off, leaving Rose to die. \n"}]}
