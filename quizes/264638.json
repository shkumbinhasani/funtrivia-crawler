The book was a huge success and marked the first time that Marvel Comics produced a superhero group book since the so-called 'Golden Age' of comic books (1938-1956). The book also re-introduced the character of 'The Human Torch' back into the comic book world, although this character was completely different than the previous one introduced back in the late 1930's; Johnny Storm was a human teenager who gained his powers through cosmic rays while the previous Torch was an android.\r The first series of \"The Fantastic Four\" ran for 416 issues and was finally cancelled in 1996, but there have been at least three other reincarnations of the book since that time. \n"}, {"text": "Throughout the 'Golden Age' of comic books, the purchase price of a regular-sized comic was $0.10, and as the so-called 'Silver Age' began (1956), the price remained the same. Then, in the early 1960's, the price of a regular-sized comic book increased to $0.12.

Not only is she the most beautiful woman at the ceremony, she is the center of attention, as well; all eyes are on her. That wasn't the case with the Invisible Woman's wedding. It was crashed by virtually every supervillain that the group had fought. The team defeated them all, however, and went on to finish the ceremony in \"Fantastic Four Annual\" #3. \n"}, {"text": "The Incredible Hulk vs. The Thing. In the early days of the Marvel Universe, there was probably no greater battle between two characters than these two.

In fact, the battle spilled over into issue 26 and it took the combined might of the Fantastic Four and the Avengers to put a stop to the Hulk's rampage. \n"}, {"text": "In which issue did Sue Richards give birth to her son, Franklin?", "correct": "\"Fantastic Four Annual\" # 6", "options": ["\"Fantastic Four Annual\" # 8", "\"Fantastic Four\" # 73", "\"Fantastic Four\" # 100"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Fantastic Four Annual\" # 6.\n\n\tIn the 1966 to 1968 issues of \"Fantastic Four Annual\" #6, Reed and Sue were blessed with their son, Franklin. \n"}, {"text": "In the same issue that Sue Richards had her son, Franklin, one of the group's most powerful villains, The Molecule Man, also made his debut.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tWhile the Molecule Man was one of the group's most powerful foes, his debut occured in \"Fantastic Four\" #20, in 1963.

After returning to the Baxter Building and throwing Mr. Fantastic into the Negtive Zone, the villain was moved by the pleas of the Invisible Woman for the life of her husband.Upon entering the Negative Zone, 'the Thing' finds Reed and literally throws him back to safety as the asteroid he is on drifts into the sun and explodes. \n"}, {"text": "Psycho-Man is a villain from the Negative Zone.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPsycho-Man came from the Microverse and had the power to control the emotions of others.

Grom had gone mad and started destroying planets and even tried to exterminate his fellow gods, the Eternals. However, they defeated him and he set his sights on Earth. Taking over the mind of Reed Richards, Grom nearly succeeded in not only destroying the Fantastic Four, but Earth, as well.It wasn't until the rest of the team turned to Dr. Doom (widely considered the second smartest man in the Marvel universe after Reed) did the Overmind experience defeat. Victor von Doom may be an evil despot with designs on world domination and beyond, but even he saw the threat that the Overmind posed if he wasn't stopped. \n"}, {"text": "What were the names of Dr. Doom's parents?", "correct": "Werner and Cynthia", "options": ["Viktor and Katherine", "Otto and Magda", "Ivan and  Anna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWerner and Cynthia.\n\n\tWerner and Cynthia von Doom were the parents of the man who would grow up to become Dr. Doom.

Werner died while trying to protect Victor from a snowstorm as the two were being pursued by a group of soldiers after Werner had failed to heal the wife of a local Baron. Cynthia died when Doom was still quite young. And, like most children, her death affected Doom deeply. In fact, for many years after her death, Doom was obsessed with bringing his mother back from the grave. \r In a 1980's Marvel Graphic Novel featuring a solo Dr. Doom story, Doom travels to Hell along with Dr. Strange, a sorceror supreme, to help him to free his mother's soul from the clutches of that realm's lord, Mephisto.

Doctor Octopus was in a mad rage when Reed confronted him and the two wasted precious time in battle. \r Finally, Reed was able to subdue Octopus and convince him to help him find a cure for the radiation poisioning that was affecting his unborn child. However, in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the Fantastic Four's history, Reed is told by the Sue's physician that he has arrived thirty minutes too late. Although Sue was fine, the child was could not be saved. \n"}, {"text": "Which huge Marvel crossover event ended the first series of \"Fantastic Four\"?", "correct": "\"The Onslaught Saga\"", "options": ["\"The Infinity War\"", "\"Atlantis Rising\"", "\"The Evolutionary War\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Onslaught Saga\".\n\n\t\"The Onslaught Saga\" was the last storyline of the first volume of \"The Fantastic Four\" series, which ended with issue number 416, in 1996. This huge crossover tale, which began in the pages of \"The X-Men\", saw the psyches of Prof. Xavier and Magneto joined together to create the villain, Onslaught, who had immense power. It took the combined might of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and many other heroes to stop Onslaught. In doing so, these heroes were thought to have been killed, however, they were all just transported to a pocket universe by Sue and Reed's son, Franklin, who has vast psionic powers himself.\r This storyline ran through many of Marvel's most popular titles and gave the company the opportunity to 're-start' many of their titles back at number one so that a new generation of readers could be found. \"The Avengers\", \"Fantastic Four\", and \"Captain America\" were the titles that were re-started, although \"The Fantastic Four\" has since gone back to its original numbering sequence. \n"}]}
