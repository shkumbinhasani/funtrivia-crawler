When King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) come across them, they are asked to locate a shrubbery but upon returning with the requested item, they are requested to locate another shrubbery before venturing out into the forest to chop down the tallest tree with a herring. By this point, they are no longer the Knights Who Say Ni either, so it all works out quite surreal.
