CART assumed the event in 1989, before shifting the track to Belle Isle Park. IndyCar assumed the event after a brief pause following the merger and began holding unique doubleheader weekends, consisting of points-paying races on both Saturday and Sunday of the event weekend.\r Open wheel racing in Toronto began in 1986 on the 11-turn racetrack at Exhibition Place. The race was absorbed by IndyCar from CART/Champ Car in 2009.

The unique front stretch lined with palm trees and fountain turn snakes around the Long Beach Convention Center and Aquarium of the Pacific.
