{"id": "305866", "name": "Grammar and the Land of Oz Trivia Quiz | Grammatical and Lexical Items | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Humanities Trivia", "English", "Grammatical and Lexical Items"], "questions": [{"text": "In the beginning of the \"Wizard of Oz\", Hunk says, \"Ow! You got my finger!\" Which type of word is \"ow\"?", "correct": "an interjection", "options": ["an adverb", "a verb", "an adjective"], "explanation": "\n\n\nan interjection.\n\n\tAn interjection is a word which expresses strong emotion or constitutes a sound filler. Words such as \"ow\", \"gosh\", \"um\" and \"er\" are examples of interjections. Hunk wanted to show Zeke that he was angry at being hurt by Zeke's clumsiness. In this quote, \"got\" is a verb. \n"}, {"text": "Speaking to her niece, Aunt Em says sadly, \"We can't go against the law, Dorothy.\" Which type of word is \"can't\"?", "correct": "a modal verb", "options": ["an adverb", "a preposition", "an adjective"], "explanation": "\n\n\na modal verb.\n\n\tModal verbs are used to change the mood of a sentence. Some common modal verbs are \"can\", \"must\", \"might\" and \"should.\" Em wanted to express to Dorothy the impossibility of disobeying a court order that allowed Miss Gulch to take away Dorothy's dog, Toto. \n"}, {"text": "Professor Marvel describes a photo of Aunt Em by saying, \"She's wearing a polka dot dress.\" Which verb tense is the professor using?", "correct": "the present continuous", "options": ["the past", "the simple present", "the future"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe present continuous.\n\n\tThe present continuous (progressive) tense describes action which is happening \"right now.\" It consists of \"is/are/am\" plus the present participle of a main verb. Professor Marvel was trying to convince Dorothy to return to her farm. The simple present tense describes events which usually happen; it does not normally use an -ing verb form. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes by Dorothy Gale is an example of the present perfect tense?", "correct": "\"I've never heard of a beautiful witch before!\"", "options": ["\"My! People come and go so quickly here!\"", "\"Toto's my dog!\"", "\"I didn't mean to kill anyone!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"I've never heard of a beautiful witch before!\".\n\n\tThe present perfect tense is a bridge between past and present action. Dorothy was describing her entire life's experience when she used the form, \"I've never...\" The present perfect tense uses \"has/have\" plus the past participle of a main verb. The verb \"didn't\" indicates a past action; the other two choices in this question are written in the simple present tense. \n"}, {"text": "Glinda tells the Wicked Witch, \"Be gone before somebody drops a house on you!\" Which word in her sentence is a subordinating conjunction?", "correct": "before", "options": ["house", "somebody", "drops"], "explanation": "\n\n\nbefore.\n\n\tA conjunction is a word which connects two clauses or sentences. Some common conjunctions are \"if\", \"because\", \"and\", \"before\" and \"after\". Glinda was combining sentences and thoughts when she warned the Wicked Witch. \"House\" and \"somebody\" are examples of nouns; \"drops\" is a verb and \"too\" is an adverb. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes from the Scarecrow includes an example of the passive voice?", "correct": "\"You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together.\"", "options": ["\"I'm a failure because I haven't got a brain!\"", "\"My! It's good to be free!\"", "\"Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together.\"\n\n\tThe passive voice consists of a form of the verb \"be\" plus the past participle of a main verb. In the passive voice, the person, or subject, doing the action is not as important as the object, or person, who is receiving the action. A farmer probably stuffed and sewed the Scarecrow, but the Scarecrow was more important to the movie viewers. The other three choices in this question are written in the active voice. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes from the Tin Man gives us an example of the subjunctive mood?", "correct": "\"If I only had a heart...\"", "options": ["\"Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.\"", "\"Now I know I've got a heart...'cause it's breaking.\"", "\"The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"If I only had a heart...\"\n\n\tThe subjunctive mood expresses commands or wishes / statements that are contrary to fact. The most common words used in the subjunctive are \"wish\" and \"if.\" When the Tin Man says, \"If I only had a heart\", he believed that he did not have a heart. \"If I could fly, I would soar like a bird\" is another example of the subjunctive mood. The other three choices in this question are written in the indicative (factual) mood. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes from the Wicked Witch contains a prepositional phrase?", "correct": "\"And you! I'll use you for a beehive!\"", "options": ["\"You cursed brat!...I'm melting!\"", "\"Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too!\"", "\"Poppies...now they'll sleep. Sleep!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"And you! I'll use you for a beehive!\".\n\n\tA preposition is a word which gives location to a noun. Some common examples of prepositions are \"in\", \"on\", \"at\" and \"for\". A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition plus a noun or noun phrase - in this case, \"for a beehive\". The Wicked Witch was speaking to the Tin Man when she uttered this nasty sentence. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes from the Cowardly Lion is an example of a tag question?", "correct": "\"They sure knocked the stuffin' out of you, didn't they?\"", "options": ["\"But what if she kills us first?\"", "\"Is my nose bleeding?\"", "\"How long can you stay fresh in that can?\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"They sure knocked the stuffin' out of you, didn't they?\".\n\n\tWe use tag questions to double-check or confirm our information. A tag question consists of a statement plus an auxiliary verb (tag). The auxiliary tag is normally the opposite form of the opening statement in declarative sentences: \"You love grammar, don't you?\" In the example from the quiz, the Lion saw that his friend the Scarecrow was badly hurt by the Wicked Witch's winged monkeys. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these quotes by the Wizard is an example of the imperative mood?", "correct": "\"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\"", "options": ["\"The Great Oz has spoken!\"", "\"Times being what they were, I accepted the job.\"", "\"Every pusillanimous creature...has a brain.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\".\n\n\tThe imperative mood of a verb expresses a command or a request. The unstated subject of the imperative form is \"you.\" The Wizard was ordering Dorothy and her friends not to look at the man who was speaking behind the curtain. The other three choices in this question are examples of declarative sentences. \n"}]}
