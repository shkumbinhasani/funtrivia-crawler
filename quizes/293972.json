{"id": "293972", "name": "Suicide Awareness Quiz / Test | Psychology | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Psychology", "Psychological Disorders"], "questions": [{"text": "Usually a person planning to commit suicide displays some warning signs.  Unfortunately it is often only in hindsight that these are recognised.  Which of the following is NOT an early warning sign that a person may be intending to suicide?", "correct": "Making plans to attend a family function", "options": ["Changes in sleep pattern", "Withdrawing from family and friends", "Giving away possessions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMaking plans to attend a family function.\n\n\tThere are many behaviours that could suggest a person may be contemplating suicide.  Some of most common include; changes to eating habits, sleep pattern, personal hygiene or drug use; risk taking behaviour; expressing thoughts of hopelessness, helplessness or despair; feelings of guilt, failure or shame; an increased interest in suicide or death; making arrangements for loved ones or pets; or having suffered a recent bereavement or other loss (e.g. job or relationship).  It is crucial that anybody experiencing any of these symptoms receive help immediately. \n"}, {"text": "Given that depression is the highest risk factor of suicide, once a person starts receiving treatment for depression they are immediately at a lower risk of suicide.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe risk of suicide is actually higher once a person's mood begins to lift.  This is because a person suffering from major depression can be very lethargic, and although they may desire to die, they simply do not have the energy to attempt to harm themselves.  Once treatment is commenced they may find they have more energy, though as they are not yet properly treated for depression, their outlook on the future remains hopeless. \n"}, {"text": "In the United States of America the most common method of suicide is by firearms, which accounts for more than half of all deaths.  Access to guns in Australia is limited and use of a firearm to commit suicide is the fourth most common method.  What method accounts for the highest proportion of suicides in Australia?", "correct": "Hanging", "options": ["Cutting (e.g. wrists)", "Carbon Monoxide poisoning", "Drowning"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHanging.\n\n\tMethods of suicide differ depending on the age and sex of a person.  For males in Australia hanging is the most common method of suicide (38%), followed by carbon monoxide poisoning (24%), firearms (14%) and other poison (9%).  For females, hanging is also the most common method (30%), followed closely by poisoning by liquid or solid (27%), carbon monoxide poisoning (19%) and jumping (5%).  Drowning and cutting contribute to less than 1% of all suicides.\r Information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n"}, {"text": "Often people don't want to ask a loved one if he or she is thinking of suicide as they are afraid they will \"put the idea in their head\".  This is not the case, and is an important question to ask.  Once you have established that a person is suicidal, what is the next important thing to ask?", "correct": "How they plan to commit suicide", "options": ["How they could be so selfish", "Why they plan to commit suicide", "Why they are depressed"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHow they plan to commit suicide.\n\n\tWhile a person with vague suicidal thoughts is at a high risk of committing suicide, a person with an actual plan of HOW they will commit suicide is at an extreme and imminent risk.  This is especially true if the method is easily available and they have set a time.  This does not mean that a person without any well thought out plan will not attempt suicide, and indeed a person with only passive suicidal ideation (e.g. I wish I would just die in my sleep) is still at risk of suicide and in need of immediate professional attention. \n"}, {"text": "OK, you have established that your friend is suicidal.  Under what circumstances would it be safe to leave them alone?", "correct": "They shouldn't be alone", "options": ["If you need to go to work or school", "If they are in their own home", "Once they appear happier"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey shouldn't be alone.\n\n\tA person who is actively suicidal should not be left alone at all.  Even the average bedroom contains items such as sheets, electrical cords, belts and shoelaces that can be used in an attempted hanging.  If you are unable to stay with them, arrange for another trusted person to be with them or take them to where they can see a mental health professional.  A sudden change in mood from depressed to happy or at ease is a warning sign for suicide.  Often once a person makes the decision to suicide, they feel relieved as their perceived problems will soon be over. \n"}, {"text": "What should you NOT do if a person tells you they are having suicidal thoughts?", "correct": "Promise to keep their secret", "options": ["Talk openly and directly", "Take them seriously", "Be willing to listen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPromise to keep their secret.\n\n\tA person with suicidal thoughts often believes that he or she is beyond help.  You are not violating a privileged communication by talking to a mental health professional in order to ensure they receive the help they need.  All suicide threats should be taken seriously.  Although it can be difficult, it is important not to judge the person and to discuss the topic freely without showing shock or disapproval. \n"}, {"text": "Never used on its own, a suicide contract is a tool that can be utilised in the long term management of a person with suicidality.  A suicide contract can be a verbal agreement, but more commonly is a written contract signed by the person at risk of suicide.  The contract will obviously include a clause not to harm themselves, but what else should be included in the contract?", "correct": "Names and phone-numbers of support people", "options": ["Legal terminology", "A list of reasons not to commit suicide", "Information about depression and symptoms"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNames and phone-numbers of support people.\n\n\tA suicide contract is NOT a guarantee that a person will not commit suicide, and is always used in conjunction with counselling and/or medication.  While a medical practitioner may use a suicide contract, its effectiveness in preventing suicide has not been clinically proven.  A suicide contract can however be useful in establishing rapport and trust between the clinician and client. If it is decided that a suicide contract would be useful, then the contract should be as simple as possible, including a guarantee not to suicide and who to contact if the person is feeling suicidal.  The contract should be kept in an easily accessible area in the home. \n"}, {"text": "A person's risk of suicide is increased if he or she attempted suicide in the past.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tPast suicide attempts are one the major risk factors of suicide, and recent attempts are of particular importance.  This is one of the first questions a mental health professional will ask when assessing a person's suicide risk.  Having a family member who has committed suicide is also a risk factor. \n"}, {"text": "Suicidal thoughts are often a symptom of depression.  CBT, used in conjunction with medication, has been proven effective in treating depression.  What does CBT stand for?", "correct": "Cognitive behavioural therapy", "options": ["Complete behavioural therapy", "Comprehensive brain therapy", "Computerised brain tomography"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy.\n\n\tCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy for people affected by mental illness. CBT involves a qualified health professional talking to the person about their symptoms, and working on alternative ways of thinking about and coping with them and their effects. \n"}, {"text": "Along with grief, family and friends may feel stigmatised and isolated after a suicide death.  Which of these could be helpful responses to a person in this situation?", "correct": "All of these answers", "options": ["Be aware of difficult times such as anniversaries or holidays", "Listen to them without judging", "Ask if they would like to talk about the person who has died"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these answers.\n\n\tJust being available to listen is the most important thing you can do. Suicide usually comes as a shock as the death is unexpected, and the survivors need time to grieve.  There still remains a social stigma attached to suicide that family members may have to deal with.  Offering practical support such as shopping or cooking and finding information on support groups is another way you can help.\r Remember suicide can be preventable.  In Australia people with thoughts of committing suicide should visit their local GP or hospital for support. Many countries have helplines manned by trained volunteers who will listen, offer guidance (if requested) and point anyone contemplating suicide in the right direction to find help. \n"}]}
