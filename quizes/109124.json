The obvious one is Germany, and it's probably fairly well known that a majority of Austrians speak German.  Switzerland is a bit more tricky, as there are 4 official languages in that country (German, French, Italian and Romansch), but German is the most widely spoken.  The sneakiest of the bunch is tiny little Liechtenstein, population 32,000.  A majority of Liechtensteiners speak German as their native tongue, and it is also the official language! \n"}, {"text": "A physical geography question: which of these countries is not considered to be 'elongated'?  \n", "correct": "Philippines", "options": ["Chile", "Vietnam", "Panama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhilippines.\n\n\tAn elongated country is one whose length is much longer than its width, in simple terms.

Qatar's borders with both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are undefined, though no real dispute exists in that case.  China and Pakistan share an disputed border, and both of those countries also share disputed borders with India.  These disputes have been the cause of a number of wars and conflicts.  In the past, China also had border disputes with the former Soviet Union and with Vietnam.  These have been resolved. \n"}, {"text": "What is the largest country (by area) in the world that has a land border on only one other country?  \n", "correct": "Canada", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCanada.\n\n\tUnbelievable as it seems, the 2nd largest country in the world only has one neighbor, the United States.

The largest country in the world, Russia, borders 13 countries, while China, the world's third largest country borders a whopping 14! \n"}, {"text": "What is the longest river whose drainage basin is located entirely in one country (in other words, the longest river only located in one country)?  \n", "correct": "Yangtze", "options": ["Amazon", "Yenisey", "Mississippi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYangtze.\n\n\tThe Yangtze River is entirely located in China, as is its drainage basin; it stretches a total 3,720 miles (5,980 km).

The Amazon is a longer river, but is also located in Peru (with its drainage basin covering several other countries as well).

What is the largest landlocked country outside of Asia?  \n", "correct": "Chad", "options": ["Iran", "Bolivia", "Congo (formerly Zaire)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChad.\n\n\tNeither the Democratic Republic of Congo (aka Zaire) nor Iran are landlocked countries, so they are automatically disqualified.

The next largest landlocked country after Chad is Mali, also in Africa, and after that Niger.
