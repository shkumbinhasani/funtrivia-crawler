{"id": "231487", "name": "The Video Game Scavenger Hunt Quiz | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "We've just received a clue to a scavenger hunt saying: \"You will find your next hint to the west of Saffron City\".  Well, I know that Saffron City is in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series, but what's west of this area?", "correct": "Celadon City", "options": ["Lavender Town", "The Power Plant", "Rock Tunnel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCeladon City.\n\n\tOur clue is quite vague, because after all, there's quite a bit to see in Celadon City.  Celadon City features a large department store for all of our Poke-needs, the famous, yet mysterious Game Corner, and the fourth Pok\u00e9mon gym of the game.  I happened to remember that Saffron City was in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series games because all of the towns in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow\" are named after different colours (eg. Cinnabar, Fuchsia, Indigo, etc.).  Saffron City is the largest location in the game, and it's the business capital of Kanto containing the largest corporation in the area, Silph Co. \n"}, {"text": "Thankfully, we didn't need to search high and low for our next clue because it was at the local Pok\u00e9center.  Our next clue is telling us to head to the Spencer Mansion for our next clue.  In which game is the Spencer Mansion commonly found?", "correct": "Resident Evil", "options": ["Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem", "Silent Hill", "Mortal Kombat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResident Evil.\n\n\tOur next clue is a little more dangerous to acquire.  The Spencer Mansion (also known as the Arklay Research Lab) is quite deadly since it features Umbrella's deadly T-Virus creations including zombies, undead dogs, genetic mutants, and horrible creations.  Hopefully, we won't need to go too deep into the mansion, because many know of the fate of the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha and Bravo Teams who were forced to fight through the madness inside.  Hey, it could be worse though; we could be heading to Raccoon City! \n"}, {"text": "As we take our clue from the front door of the Spencer Mansion, we run from the property and to safety.  When we're a safe distance away, we read the clue telling us to head to the main location of \"Banjo-Tooie\".  Where are we heading?", "correct": "Isle O' Hags", "options": ["Gruntilda's Lair", "Cloud Cuckooland", "Witchyworld"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIsle O' Hags.\n\n\tThe Isle O' Hags contains Witchyworld and Cloud Cuckooland, while Gruntilda's Lair was originally in \"Banjo-Kazooie\".  The Isle O' Hags is much like Gruntilda's Lair because both contain entrances to the various worlds that the main characters must travel to in order to find musical notes, Jinjos, Jiggies, and new skills.  Both games feature many popular characters including Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo.  Both games are for the Nintendo 64.\r In \"Banjo-Tooie\", Gruntilda will have accidentally killed Bottles the Mole, but we can still obtain the clue from his ghost! \n"}, {"text": "After having the ghost of Bottles the Mole hand us our clue, we continue our quest.  Our next clue tells us to head to the entrance of the Water Temple.  Well, that can only mean \"Ocarina of Time\", the popular N64 \"Legend of Zelda\" title.  Where is the entrance to the Water Temple in that game?", "correct": "Lake Hylia", "options": ["Zora's Fountain", "Zora's Domain", "Ice Cavern"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLake Hylia.\n\n\tThe Water Temple is one of the five temples that Link needs to fight through in N64's \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\".  The third temple (the Water Temple) is home to Shadow Link, Morpha, and the Longshot.  It is often known as one of the more confusing temples since it requires that you raise and lower water levels in order to reach certain locations.  Lake Hylia also contains the Fishing Grotto, Laboratory, Pierre the Scarecrow, and an entrance to Zora's Domain.  In order to access this temple, we need to go to the Ice Caverns and get the Iron Boots.  At the same time, Link'll learn the \"Serenade of Water\" from Sheik.\r Well, I hope you brought your scuba gear, because we'll need to swim deep for this clue... \n"}, {"text": "As we dry off, we realize that our next clue is forcing us to go to Lut Gholein.  In which game series are we likely to find this arid location, and our next set of directions?", "correct": "Diablo", "options": ["Prince of Persia", "Warcraft", "Legacy of Kain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiablo.\n\n\tLut Gholein is probably the safest place you can be in Act II of \"Diablo II\".  This desert outpost will be a safe haven from the dangers of the sands outside the city limits, and it will also contain all of the shops, items, and important people you'll need in order to complete the six quests of the act.  The sewers of this town are probably the least safe because they contain the evil Radament and many dead corpses that can damage a low-level character.\r We'll probably be wishing we were back in the Water Temple after this.  Let's get our clue and head out! \n"}, {"text": "When we receive our next clue, we're told to head to the shade of the Forest of Illusion.  Thank the heavens for this development!  In which game can we experience the shades of the Forest of Illusion first-hand?", "correct": "Super Mario World", "options": ["Earthbound", "Chrono Trigger", "Terranigma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuper Mario World.\n\n\tAfter passing through Ludwig von Koopa's castle to the north, Mario can head down into the Forest of Illusion in the popular SNES game \"Super Mario World\".  This forest contains many secret entrances and exits to certain levels which must be used to reach Roy Koopa's castle on the other side of the forest.  Not only that, but the area features a Reznor Fortress and a Star Road to the west and the final of four Switch Palaces to the west.  Other areas in this game are Vanilla Dome, Donut Land, and Chocolate Land.\r Hopefully, we don't get lost in the depths of the forest along the way.  Let's find our clue and get our prize! \n"}, {"text": "We pick our clue off a tree in the forest and read it.  \"Make your way to Green Hill Zone for your next clue,\" it says.  Hmmm...  I really don't know what to do next.  In which type of game can we find the Green Hill Zone?", "correct": "A \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" game", "options": ["A \"Pok\u00e9mon\" game", "A \"Mario\" game", "A \"Donkey Kong\" game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" game.\n\n\tAh yes!  I remember now!  The Green Hill Zone was the first, and possibly most well-known stage in the original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games for the Sega Genesis, Sega Master, and Sega Game Gear systems.  In a Green Hill level, Sonic would need to cross a lush, hilly landscape in order to reach the end.  It was often the easiest level, being the first, and it ended with the usual fight with Dr. Robotnik.  A similar level was added to the \"Sonic Heroes\" game for the Gamecube.\r Let's head to the hills for this clue!  I have a feeling we're near the end! \n"}, {"text": "Our next clue instructs us to ride the Crazy Caterpillar to search for our treasure.  We're nearing the end, and we just happen to know that the Crazy Caterpillar is a rollercoaster!  Where can this thrill ride be found?", "correct": "Rollercoaster Tycoon", "options": ["SimTheme Park", "SimCoaster", "Super Mario Sunshine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon.\n\n\tThe Crazy Caterpillar can be found in nearly any park in the popular PC hit \"Rollercoaster Tycoon\" which allows players to build a simulated amusement park.  The Crazy Caterpillar is often the cheapest default Steel Mini Rollercoaster, and it's one of the smallest coasters in the game.  Although this is a default coaster it can go under any name, but its template is titled 'Crazy Caterpillar'.  When you create your own coasters, you can save them and edit them under any name.  In \"Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 or 3\", a coaster builder will make this process much easier. \n"}, {"text": "As we ride the Crazy Caterpillar, we spot our treasure chest near the ride exit.  We also happen to notice that it has a symbol on it nearly identical to one found on a droppable item in \"Mario Kart 64\".  What symbol is on the chest?", "correct": "An upside-down question mark", "options": ["An exclamation mark", "An asterisk", "The letter M"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn upside-down question mark.\n\n\tIf we happen to collect an item similar to an item box with an upside-down question mark in \"Mario Kart 64\", we can drop it to create an obstacle for other drivers.  The item mimics an item box, so if it's placed amongst a cluster of them, it will blend in to make a perfect, yet unfortunate surprise.  This type of box was also used in future \"Mario Kart\" games for the Gamecube and the DS systems.  Another droppable item in the game is the banana.\r Hopefully we don't experience the same fate of the drivers when we open the box...we're within reach now! \n"}, {"text": "As we open our prize chest, we're surprised by what we see- bunches of golden bananas.  Ah well, it's better than nothing, right?  And it still follows our video game theme.  The amount of bananas in the chest is equal to the amount of golden bananas that can be collected in \"Donkey Kong 64\".  How many bananas are in the chest?", "correct": "201", "options": ["121", "1", "151"], "explanation": "\n\n\n201.\n\n\tIn every stage of \"Donkey Kong 64\", players can collect twenty-five Golden Bananas.  This consists of five bananas each for Donkey Kong, Diddy, Tiny, Chunky, and Lanky.  After collecting all 200 bananas, you may want to reach the hidden final banana.  Where is it?  If you collected all of the Banana Fairies through the game using the camera, you can get the final Golden Banana from the Grand Fairy.  Bananas are a big part of the \"Donkey Kong\" series often appearing in all of its games.\r Well, we've finally found our treasure.  Mission accomplished! \n"}]}
