{"id": "170814", "name": "'M*A*S*H' - 'Bulletin Board' Quiz | 'M*A*S*H' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "At the beginning of 'Bulletin Board' we see Trapper and Hawkeye wasting valuable time, as usual.  In this case they are playing with a paddle ball set.  Radar breaks up this monotony by announcing that Colonel Blake is hosting a lecture.  What is the topic of this latest lecture from the Colonel?", "correct": "Sex", "options": ["V.D.", "Gambling", "Foot hygiene"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSex.\n\n\tColonel Blake gives a shockingly sober lecture on the dangers of sexual relations between the local population and American servicemen.  He claims that he doesn't expect his men to behave like monks, but he warns them against leaving behind any 'monklets'.  Ah that Henry, he does have a way with words! \n"}, {"text": "After a visit to the camp bulletin board with Hawkeye and Trapper, Frank Burns settles himself in the Swamp to write a letter.  Margaret soon interrupts him with an important request.  It seems that she is a little short on money and asks Frank if he can loan her what amount?", "correct": "$240", "options": ["$710", "$50", "$7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n$240.\n\n\tMargaret's younger sister is getting married and she wishes to purchase a wedding gift, but doesn't have the $240 she needs.  She requests this of Frank, who stoutly refuses on principle.  During the conversation we learn that Margaret's father is dead (he is miraculously revived in later episodes) and that her mother is not only a drunk, but also a klepto. \n"}, {"text": "After Frank refuses Margaret's request for a loan, the two of them exchange several quotes.  Which of these quotes is not among those that they share?", "correct": "'Love of money is the root of all evils' - Timothy", "options": ["'To give and not count the cost' - St. Ignatius Loyola", "'Neither a lender nor a borrower be' - Polonius", "'The holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last throughout a whole lifetime if not asked to lend money' - Mark Twain"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Love of money is the root of all evils' - Timothy.\n\n\tAfter refusing Margaret's request, he throws the Polonius quote (from Shakespeare's 'Hamlet') at her.  She retorts with the Loyola quote, to which Frank provides the Twain quote in response.  Finally fed up with Frank's aphorisms, Margaret delivers the following: ''Blow it out your ear,' Margaret Houlihan!'  I don't think that final quote is an original! \n"}, {"text": "After leaving the Swamp, we are directed to the officer's club, where Trapper is writing a letter to his daughter about the crazy goings-on at the M*A*S*H 4077th.  What is Trapper's daughter's name?", "correct": "Becky", "options": ["Fannie", "Marci", "Maryanne"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecky.\n\n\tTrapper actually has two daughters, Becky and Cathy, but this particular letter is directed to Becky.  Trapper describes Hawkeye as a 'good egg', while Frank is described as 'a substitute teacher who stays all year'.  This is the only episode that features a letter home written by Trapper. \n"}, {"text": "That evening, a movie is featured in the mess tent.  Several snippets of the film are shown, all of which include excerpts of Shirley Temple tap dancing with which old time legend?", "correct": "Bill Robinson", "options": ["Fred Astaire", "Ann Miller", "Ginger Rogers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBill Robinson.\n\n\tBill Robinson, aka Mr. Bojangles, dances with Shirley Temple in the 1935 film 'The Little Colonel' in one of the all-time great tap dancing moments in film. \n"}, {"text": "During the film tempers flare as the frustrations of the day boil over for members of the 4077th.  Which of the following individuals gets into a wrestling match with Klinger during the movie?", "correct": "Zale", "options": ["Igor", "Frank", "Margaret"], "explanation": "\n\n\nZale.\n\n\tKlinger and Zale never seem to get along during the series, and this episode is no exception.  Zale first knocks Klinger's hat off his head, claiming it's in his way.  Personally, I think Zale is just jealous because Klinger has a date.  Later, we find Zale sitting in Klinger's spot after Klinger goes to get a bag of popcorn.  Klinger roughly pushes Zale out of his seat, and soon the wrestling begins! \n"}, {"text": "Following the melee in the mess tent, Hawkeye and Trapper are back at the bulletin board looking at a notice advertising the 'First Annual Polly Adler's Birthday Cookout, Picnic and Barbecue'.  They hope that camp morale will be boosted at this cookout, and some funding will be raised for Sister Theresa's orphanage.  Which member of the 4077th does his/her part at the cookout by setting up a $1 kissing booth? ", "correct": "Klinger", "options": ["Hawkeye", "Margaret", "Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKlinger.\n\n\tKlinger complains to Father Mulcahy that he hasn't been very successful, only making a total of $3. Klinger claims, 'I could make more, but you wouldn't believe what they expect for a dollar.'  Father Mulcahy responds good-naturedly, 'Oh, well, do your best, my, uh, my son.'  I love the hesitance to call Klinger 'son' while he hands Klinger his rainbow scarf. \n"}, {"text": "One of the festivities at the cookout is a competition to fill cups of water that are at some distance away with which of these small items?", "correct": "Spoons", "options": ["Syringes", "Shot glasses", "Thimbles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpoons.\n\n\tThe contestants have to fill a spoon with water, then take the spoons about 20 feet away to a glass and fill what contents that remain in the spoon into the glasses.  The cookout also features a stage for the puppet show 'Punch and Judy', performed ably by Trapper and a nurse...they kiss their way through the entire performance! \n"}, {"text": "The festivities also include a footrace for the nurses.  Which of the following individuals wins this footrace?", "correct": "Frank Burns", "options": ["Nurse Kelly", "Nurse Abel", "Nurse Baker"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Burns.\n\n\tFrank finally agrees to Margaret's request for a loan, but only with an I.O.U. and an interest rate of 5%.  Margaret is so incensed upon hearing about Frank's usurious plan that she chases him right into the middle of the nurse's race.  Much to his 'delight', Frank comes in first place and receives a lovely bra donated by Klinger. \n"}, {"text": "The final competition is a camp tug of war, featuring the officers against the enlisted men.  Who among the dwellers of the 4077th is the first to plop into the mudpit separating the two teams?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Frank", "Klinger", "Father Mulcahy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tPoor Radar is the first into the mire, followed by the loveable Frank Burns.  Frank pulls Mulcahy into the mess, and the Father is followed by Klinger and Sergeant Zale.  Margaret and Hawkeye fall in simultaneously, and are quickly followed by Trapper.  Finally, Trapper helps yank Henry into the muck.  The fun is soon ended, however, when Radar announces the arrival of choppers.  Our fun has ended as well, thank you for trying this quiz.
