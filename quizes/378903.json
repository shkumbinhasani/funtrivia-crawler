{"id": "378903", "name": "\"Homer at the Bat\" Trivia Game | 'Simpsons' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Simpsons", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Who's the first to sign up for softball tryouts?", "correct": "Homer", "options": ["Smithers", "Lenny", "Carl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHomer.\n\n\tHomer, indulging in a fresh box of doughtnuts at work, starts choking on his treats before Lenny points out that the annual company softball team tryouts has a sign-up list on the break room bulletin board.  Assuring the guys that he has a secret weapon this year, Homer convinces the others to sign up with him.\rWhen he gets home, Homer shows Bart his secret, a homemade bat, and he plans to lead the power plant team to victory with it. \n"}, {"text": "What does Homer name his special baseball bat?", "correct": "Wonderbat", "options": ["Superbat", "Homerbat", "Magic Bat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWonderbat.\n\n\tHomer explains to Bart that he made the bat on the night of a horrible thunderstorm, during which he was locked out of the house and needed to seek shelter.  Grabbing a piece of sheet metal and hiding under the tallest tree he could find, the wood he would use literally fell in front of him when lightning struck a branch above.  That night, he spent the entire time planing and blowtorching the special branch to create the Wonderbat.  He predicts hitting three thousand home runs in this season alone.  Bart is impressed. \n"}, {"text": "What team does Springfield need to beat to win the pennant?", "correct": "Shelbyville", "options": ["Capitol City", "North Haverbrook", "Ogdenville"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShelbyville.\n\n\tOpening day rolls around and the Springfield Nuclear Plant's team faces off against the Springfield Police Department.  It's fairly apparent that the cops are better than the power plant team, but when Homer steps up, bases loaded, and uses his new bat, he makes a home run on his first pitch and wins the game.  Soon, he's off winning games across town, bringing the team to its greatest string of victories ever.  The new soon makes its way to Mr. Burns, who has a few ideas about how to capture the pennant...and win a million dollar bet. \n"}, {"text": "Which pro plays the same position in softball as Homer?", "correct": "Daryl Strawberry", "options": ["Ken Griffey Jr.", "Wade Boggs", "Jose Canseco"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDaryl Strawberry.\n\n\tMr. Burns decides to cheat to win his bet, mainly by bringing on an all-star team of ringers and giving them official jobs at the nuclear plant to fulfill the team rules.  Though his ideal team consists of people who've been dead for years, Smithers sets out to amass a team of pros within the next twenty-four hours.  Ultimately, he ends up with Jose Canseco, Mike Scioscia, Ozzie Smith, Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey Jr., and Darryl Strawberry.  The guys at the plant are clearly disappointed. \n"}, {"text": "Instead of beer, Mr. Burns insists that his team drink which of these during games?", "correct": "Brain and nerve tonic", "options": ["Water", "Scotch", "Gatorade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBrain and nerve tonic.\n\n\tHomer is aware that he'll probably spend the rest of the season on the bench since Darryl Strawberry is way better than he is.  When Mr. Burns takes over the team as manager, it becomes apparent that things aren't going to get any easier.  He insists that everyone drink a brain and nerve tonic he supplies, has them all submit to hypnosis, and force them to embark on a dated exercise regime.  After their first few practices, it's clear that everything is changing, but Mr. Burns will likely take home his extra million. \n"}, {"text": "Who is repeatedly asked to remove his sideburns?", "correct": "Don Mattingly", "options": ["Jose Canseco", "Steve Sax", "Ozzie Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon Mattingly.\n\n\tTensions continue to rise on the field when Mr. Burns repeatedly asks Don Mattingly to remove his hippie-esque sideburns.  Homer, seeing the full power of his new teammates, ends up taking a pitch from Roger Clemens that destroys his Wonderbat.  The night before the big game, Mr. Burns posts the starting line-up and Homer discovers that he's not actually on it; Darryl Strawberry has officially taken his position.  Unless Burns' all-star line-up can't participate, he's as good as gold. \n"}, {"text": "Who ends up unable to play in the softball game due to a case of gigantism?", "correct": "Ken Griffey Jr.", "options": ["Mike Scioscia", "Daryl Strawberry", "Steve Sax"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKen Griffey Jr.\n\n\tOf course, not everything goes as planned.  Steve Sax ends up getting pulled over by the cops despite the fact that he seems completely happy with the idyllic neighbourhoods of Springfield.  Ultimately, all of the unsolved murders in the town are attributed to him.  At the hospital, Mike Scioscia ends up getting diagnosed with acute radiation poisoning due to his work in the nuclear plant; he's told he can't play in the softball game.  Ken Griffey Jr., meanwhile, has taken too much nerve tonic and has succumbed to gigantism. \n"}, {"text": "Ozzie Smith doesn't make it into the game because he ends up stumbling into which of these locations instead?", "correct": "Springfield Mystery Spot", "options": ["Springfield Tire Fire", "Prison", "IHOP"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpringfield Mystery Spot.\n\n\tJose Canseco ends up walking down a street the night before the big game and ends up stumbling upon a burning building where he's asked to save a woman's baby...and cat...and player piano...before he inevitably saves most of her furniture from the fire.  Wade Boggs finds himself at Moe's Tavern where, after getting into a fight with Barney over past UK Prime Ministers, he's knocked out.  Ozzie Smith, looking for tourist spots, ends up at the Springfield Mystery Spot where he gets trapped in an unending pit of mystery.  He's never seen again. \n"}, {"text": "How many of Mr. Burns' hired ringers end up playing in the final softball game?", "correct": "One & 1", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOne & 1.\n\n\tThe Simpsons end up following Homer along to the game where Mr. Burns is much more worried about his ringers than before.  Jose Canseco is still saving furniture from a burning house, he's gotten rid of Don Mattingly for shaving off his sideburns and then some, and Roger Clemens, still hypnotized from the team's training regime, believes he's a chicken.  Burns concedes and sends his workers off to the field...except Homer.  As it turns out, the only ringer fit to play is Darryl Strawberry. \n"}, {"text": "Does the Springfield team win the pennant?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tHomer ends up sitting on the bench for most of the game, and in the ninth inning the score ends up being tied-- 43-43.  With two outs and the bases loaded, Burns has Strawberry at bat but, in a moment of what he believes to be managerial genius, he pulls Strawberry for Homer, a right-handed batter, since the pitcher bats swings left.  Because of Mr. Burns' awkward hand signals off to the side, Homer ends up missing the pitch.  Fortunately though, the ball hits him in the head, knocking him out, but allowing the bases to return home.  Homer ultimately wins the game for the Springfield team. \n"}]}
