Don't look for it, it's not there anymore.  But that night I heard a band that for me redefined the word \"rock and roll\".  I remember being knocked out by their, their exuberance, their raw power -- and their punctuality\", says real life film director Rob Reiner, who plays Martin 'Marty' DiBergi, a film commercial maker.  In his own words he \"wanted to capture the sights... the sounds... the smells of a hard working rock band on the road\".  \r Having played in a band many decades ago, I think Reiner needed therapy! \n"}, {"text": "During the fall of 1982, Spinal Tap embarked on a US tour to support the release of their new album.  What was the title of this album?\n", "correct": "Smell the Glove", "options": ["Firing on all Six", "Ride the Lightning", "The Number of the Beast"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmell the Glove.\n\n\tSpinal Tap is touring the United States in support of their latest album release, 'Smell the Glove'.  The tour starts badly; at a recording industry convention held in Atlanta Ga., David St. Hubbins excitedly tells the attending guests in the Polymer Records hospitality suite that they should \"wait until you see the cover\".  Ian Faith, after being taken to one side by tour promoter Bobbi Fleckman, and the band are accused of being sexist due to the imagery that they had chosen for the record sleeve - a picture of a young woman on her knees wearing a dog collar, restrained by a leash and being forced to smell a man's hand enclosed in a black leather glove.\r\"They're not going to release the album because they have decided that the cover is sexist\" says exasperated manager Ian Faith to the band at the party.\r\"Well, so what?  What's wrong with bein' sexy?\" added guitarist Nigel Tufnel.\r\"Sex-IST!\" exclaims Ian Faith.\r\"IST!\" adds David St. Hubbins. \n"}, {"text": "On the band's arrival at JFK airport they were to be picked up and driven into the city.  What was written on the sign being held by their chauffeur?", "correct": "Spinal Pap", "options": ["Urinal Tap", "Spinal Rap", "Vinyl Crap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpinal Pap.\n\n\tMany amongst you will recognise the band's chauffeur Tommy Pischedda, played by Bruno Kirby, from blockbuster movies 'City Slickers', 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'The Godfather Part II'; he is a chauffeur with something of a Frank Sinatra fixation.  There are a number of comedic referrals to the band name scattered throughout the film if you listen carefully for them... And clearly to the surnames of some characters as well! \n"}, {"text": "Prior to calling themselves Spinal Tap, the band, which was founded during 1964, were known as The Originals.  Over time they settled on a name relevant to the city in which the band was founded.  What name had they finally opted for?", "correct": "The Thamesmen", "options": ["Kings of Leon", "The Starland Vocal Band", "The Banana Splits"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Thamesmen.\n\n\tDue to the fact that another band were already using the name that they had originally wished to use, they were forced to look for something else:\r \"We had to change our name actually\" offered St. Hubbins during an interview.\r\"Well there was another group in the East End called The Originals and we had to rename ourselves\" added Tufnel.\r\"The New Originals\" said St. Hubbins.\r\"The New Originals\" added Tufnel, \"and then they became...The Regulars, they changed their name back to The Regulars and we thought well, we could go back to The Originals but what's the point?\"\r\"We became The Thamesmen at that point\" concluded Tufnel. \n"}, {"text": "The band revealed during an interview that their original drummer, John 'Stumpy' Pepys had died in a bizarre gardening incident.  In which manner did his replacement, Eric 'Stumpy Joe' Childs, meet his demise?", "correct": "He choked on vomit...somebody else's!", "options": ["He drowned in a bath of baked beans.", "Through a party game involving an explosion.", "During an amorous encounter with a sexy dwarf."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe choked on vomit...somebody else's!\n\n\tSpinal Tap appears to go through drummers on a regular basis.  According to guitarist Nigel Tufnel, after the death of 'Stumpy' Pepys the authorities instructed the band to \"best leave it unsolved\".  The band's second drummer to die, Eric 'Stumpy Joe' Childs passed away after choking on vomit.  Quite disgustingly, and according to Tufnel during the same interview, he had choked on somebody else's vomit!\r \"What happened to 'Stumpy Joe?\" asked DiBergi\r\"Ah, it's not a very pleasant story\" answered Derek Smalls.  \"He choked.  The actual official explanation was he choked on vomit; they didn't have the facilities for testing at Scotland Yard.  They couldn't say exactly whose vomit he choked on\" continued Smalls.\r\"Yeah, you can't dust for vomit\" added Tufnel! \n"}, {"text": "During an inspection of Nigel Tufnel's amazing collection of guitars and equipment, Martin DiBergi was warned not to touch, or even look at, a specific brand of guitar.  Which brand of guitar was this? ", "correct": "Fender", "options": ["Fender ", "Jackson ", "Gibson ", "Gretsch "], "explanation": "\n\n\nFender.\n\n\t\"Now this is special, too, still got the ol' tagger on it...never even played it,\" says Tufnel.\r\"You just bought it and...?\" Says DiBergi, reaching out with his hand to touch the Fender.\r\"Don't touch it!  Don't touch it!\" Shouts Tufnel.\r\"Well uh I wasn't...I wasn't gonna touch it, I was just pointing at it!\" replied DiBergi in surprise.\r\"Well don't point, even,\" replies a calmer Tufnel as they both cross the room to inspect Tufnel's amplifiers.\r If this film is remembered for anything, it is this scene in which DiBergi and Tufnel are inspecting the latter's guitar collection and Nigel Tufnel explains to DiBergi why they have such a live advantage over other bands.\r\"Most amps go up to ten...does this mean it's louder?\" asks DiBergi. \r\"Well, it's one louder\" replies Tufnel. \n"}, {"text": "Before the show at the Vandermint Auditorium in Chapel Hill NC, Nigel Tufnel was experiencing particular difficulties with what in the band's dressing room?", "correct": "The food", "options": ["Spandex trousers", "Groupies", "Spare guitar strings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe food.\n\n\tTypical of many an incident reported in the music press over the decades, when asked if everything is OK by manager Ian Faith, Tufnel starts to complain about the quality and type of food that the band have been provided... particularly the sliced meat and rye bread! \n"}, {"text": "An equipment malfunction at the Shank Hall, Milwaukee WI concert results in band member Derek Smalls being trapped inside which of the following stage props?", "correct": "A translucent chrysalis-like container", "options": ["An enormous bean-bag", "A steel cage", "A large net"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA translucent chrysalis-like container.\n\n\tThis scene never fails to make me laugh out loud and is, in my opinion, the funniest in the entire film.  On a darkened stage the three band members are each encased in what look to be a translucent chrysalis-like containers.  As the first chords of the song are struck St. Hubbins' chrysalis opens and he steps onto the stage followed, a few seconds later, by Tufnel who has also exited his container. Despite the frantic efforts of a member of the stage crew to release him, the prop containing Smalls malfunctions, leaving him trapped inside.  Just as the song reaches its climax, Smalls is released from captivity and punches the air in salute to the cheers of the audience just as the final notes of the song die away.Hilarious! \n"}, {"text": "Which item did band manager Ian Faith carry with him at all times, which was described by DiBergi as an \"affectation\" and by Faith himself as \"a kind of totemistic thing y'know\"?", "correct": "A cricket bat", "options": ["A brightly coloured satchel", "His girlfriend's underwear", "A pair of his mother's ear-rings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA cricket bat.\n\n\tDon't be fooled by what Faith says, his cricket bat is nothing more than his 'enforcer'! In a scene inserted during the interview, an enraged Faith is seen destroying a hotel room contents with it.  From his tone it can also be safe to assume that, in the past, he has also used it as a weapon! \n"}, {"text": "After the arrival during the tour of St. Hubbins' girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone, she attempted to give each member of the band a new on-stage persona.  Which sign of the zodiac did she envisage Derek Smalls as?", "correct": "Cancer", "options": ["Aquarius", "Sagittarius", "Virgo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCancer.\n\n\tWhen St. Hubbins informs the band that his girlfriend Jeanine is travelling over from the UK to join the band, Nigel Tufnel is clearly unhappy with this.  Jeanine's arrival contributes to a number of minor disputes among the band, particularly over her ideas to transform the band's image through the use of astrological signs and making further plans for the tour using astrological star charts, which exacerbates the situation. Although it is not her initial arrival that leads to Tufnel leaving the band it is a major contributing factor; but the straw that breaks the camel's back is an occurrence a little later in the tour that is responsible for that! \n"}, {"text": "At the Xanadu Star Theatre concert in Cleveland OH, what is it that delays the band's appearance on-stage and which results in a near riot?", "correct": "The band get lost on the way to the stage.", "options": ["A fire destroys all of their instruments.", "Their vehicle suffers a breakdown.", "Their tour bus is stolen from outside the previous venue."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe band get lost on the way to the stage.\n\n\tHaving already forced the crowd to await their arrival on stage, the band finally decide to make their way from their dressing rooms.  Unfortunately, they become lost in the maze of corridors backstage in the theatre.  Taking directions from the janitor working in the bowels of the building doesn't seem to help and they remain trapped and confused in the labyrinth of passages.  It is never revealed whether or not the band ever makes it to the stage! \n"}, {"text": "The use of a replica of an ancient monument found at a European UNESCO World Heritage site results in the band being mocked on stage by the audience after its use as a stage prop. Which important historical landmark was this?", "correct": "Stonehenge", "options": ["Nelson's Column", "The Angel of the North", "The Giant's Causeway"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStonehenge.\n\n\tThe design for the Stonehenge stage prop was hurriedly drawn on a napkin with all dimensions provided by Tufnel.  Suffice to say that the somewhat confused Tufnel doesn't know the difference between feet and inches. It's a 'man' thing y'know.  \r The band's after show discussion descends into a blazing argument between St. Hubbins, his girlfriend Jeanine and Ian Faith about the latter's inability to get anything correct.  After being informed by St. Hubbins that Jeanine will be co-managing with him, Faith takes umbrage and walks out. \n"}, {"text": "The band's first gig with Jeanine in charge took place in Seattle WA, at a function in which of the following locations?", "correct": "An Air Force base", "options": ["A kindergarten", "A Mother's Union meeting", "An institution for mental patients"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn Air Force base.\n\n\tWelcoming the band as Spinal Tarp, the officer commanding is clearly as confused as why the band is there as the band members are!  He asks them if they can play a couple of slow ones so that he can have a dance as well.  The band launch into a raucous rock number and Tufnel begins to experience difficulties with his equipment; his wireless system is, unfortunately, picking up transmissions from the base control tower which are being reproduced at high volume over the band's PA system. As the Air Force personnel begin to return to their seats, clearly not enjoying their entertainment, Tufnel loses his temper, throws his guitar forcefully onto the stage, breaking it, and storms off. It is this incident that forces Tufnel's temporary absence from the band. \n"}, {"text": "After Nigel Tufnel stormed off stage at the Air Force base concert, the band lost their direction.  They were booked to play a gig at the Themeland Amusement Park, Stockton CA, but on arrival were disappointed to see on the billboard that they have been billed after which form of children's entertainment?", "correct": "A puppet show", "options": ["A troupe of clowns", "A ventriloquist", "A mime artiste"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA puppet show.\n\n\tAt this show the band, lost without their second guitarist, announce that Spinal Tap 2 will be heading in a different direction musically and launch into a free-form jazz number penned by Derek Smalls that they have titled 'Jazz Odyssey'; suffice to say that it doesn't go down well with the tiny number of fans present in the rather large auditorium! \n"}, {"text": "Immediately before the final gig of the tour, Nigel Tufnel reappears in the band dressing room with a message from their former manager Ian Faith.  Spinal Tap's single 'Sex Farm' is at number five in this country's rock chart and it looks likely that a tour there might now prove lucrative.  Which country?", "correct": "Japan", "options": ["Cambodia", "Brazil", "Uzbekistan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJapan.\n\n\tAfter receiving his message, the band begin their performance with Nigel Tufnel observing from the side of the stage.

The film's final scenes close with Spinal Tap on stage performing in front of thousands of screaming Japanese fans. \n"}]}
