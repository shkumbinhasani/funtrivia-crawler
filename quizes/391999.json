Unfortunately for the itsy bitsy spider it was washed out of the pipe!\r A waterspout can also be a funnel-shaped column of water over the sea or ocean. This rare weather formation looks like a tornado made out of water. Awesome! \n"}, {"text": "\"Jack and Jill went up the hill\nTo fetch a pail of water.\nJack fell down and broke his crown\"\n\nHis crown? Is he a king? The most common interpretation of this nursery rhyme is that the 'crown' is actually a part of Jack's body. Which part would that be?", "correct": "Head", "options": ["Leg", "Arm", "Back"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHead.\n\n\tThe word 'crown' has a huge number of different meanings in addition to the funny hat worn by monarchs.

Whilst 'dickory' is a made-up word, which of the following is a 'hickory'?", "correct": "A tree", "options": ["A cat", "A newspaper", "A chair"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA tree.\n\n\tHickory trees are found all over the world, with 12 different species in the United States alone.
