{"id": "306109", "name": "Board Games In Other Words Online Quiz | Word Play | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", " Word Play", "In Other Words"], "questions": [{"text": "Hint", "correct": "Clue & Cluedo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nClue & Cluedo.\n\n\tThe game of \"Clue\" (also known in other countries as \"Cluedo\") is quite the popular, traditional game.  Based on a mystery set in the gloomy Boddy mansion, six people are suspected of murder in nine different rooms with various murder weapons.  The idea of the game is to narrow down your list of suspects, weapons, and rooms in order to determine the correct order of each.\rBased on the popularity of this board game, a feature film (with many different endings), video games, and a series of novels have been made as tie-ins.  In addition, Parker Brothers made an updated version of the game in 2008, changing the names of characters, the rooms of the house, and the weapons to be more modernized.  This game also changed the rules a fair bit and introduced new elements to the game, most of which were criticized due to their drastic change from the original game. \n"}, {"text": "Nation of sweets", "correct": "Candyland & Candy Land", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCandyland & Candy Land.\n\n\t\"Candy Land\" is a seemingly basic, yet fiendishly difficult board game played by kids and adults alike.  Set in what appears to be an expanse of land divided by the type of candy its environment is made of, \"Candy Land\" takes players around a winding track of many spaces.  The only way to get through the game is with a stack of randomly shuffled cards which will note where your next move will take you.  Because of this, the game is entirely based on the ordering of the cards and luck; it's not based on skill or mental prowess.\rBecause of the game's tendency to be more focused at younger audiences, many versions based around cartoon characters (such as Dora the Explorer) have been released, but all of them follow the same rules.\rThis game was first made in 1949 by Milton Bradley. \n"}, {"text": "Hypothesize as to the person", "correct": "Guess Who & Guess Who?", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuess Who & Guess Who?.\n\n\t\"Guess Who?\", made by Milton Bradley and released in 1979, is comprised of two boards of flippable pieces.  Each of these pieces features a portrait of a specific character with defining features (eg. a hat, glasses, hair colour, etc.).  When it comes to a player's turn, they will ask a specific question about the characteristics of their particular character in order to determine which one it is.  When the question is answered (truthfully, of course) that player can flip down the characters that oppose what was asked.\rSpecific questions, of course, will determine if you drop more panels than others.  Due to the flexibility of questions asked, one could ask questions about both appearances and character names. \n"}, {"text": "Flawlessness", "correct": "Perfection", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPerfection.\n\n\t\"Perfection\" is unique as a game due to the fact that it is based on hand-eye coordination and puzzle-solving as opposed to the rolling of a die.  Although not entirely a 'board' game, players use a gaming platform with the ability to push down and spring back up when a timer runs its way to the end.  While the timer goes, players must fit small, plastic pieces into the game board's unique slots.  In order to win, all of the pieces need to be inserted correctly before the platform springs up, thus destroying all of the hard work put into the game to that point.\rThis game was created by Hasbro and Milton Bradley and released in the 1970s. \n"}, {"text": "Calculated chance", "correct": "Risk", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRisk.\n\n\tThis seemingly-complicated Parker Brothers game, originally released in 1957, is a world conquest on a game board.  The essential goal is to move troops around the board (depicting the world map) to invade and take over foreign countries and inevitably take over the entire world.  Using cards and dice to determine the strength of your army and where it goes makes the game more a matter of strategy than straight-up luck.  The original game makes use of Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery to denote the amount of units at a specific territory.\rDue to the subject matter of the game, it is typically for older audiences and its theme has accommodated for different versions from a \"Lord of the Rings\" theme to \"Star Wars\". \n"}, {"text": "Rodent snare", "correct": "Mouse Trap & Mousetrap", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMouse Trap & Mousetrap.\n\n\tAnother game by Milton Bradley (released in 1963), \"Mouse Trap\" is quite simple on the surface. Move your mouse character around the gameboard to collect cheese and make it so that the other players' mice don't succeed in the game.  Quite straight-forward, right?  As you go around though, the construction of an elaborate and almost unnecessarily ubiquitous mousetrap commences. By the time the other players' mice get to the cheese wheel at the end of the game, the player must make the trap complete by dropping the marble, aiming it through the bathtub, flipping the army man off the see-saw, turning a crank, and triggering a falling cage. Typically, the game is based on random chance much like \"Candy Land\". \n"}, {"text": "Chase of insignificance", "correct": "Trivial Pursuit", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrivial Pursuit.\n\n\tAlthough now a part of Hasbro's game line-up, the original \"Trivial Pursuit\" was created by Canadian newspaper editors in 1982.  Versions of the game remaining true to the original consist of six categories denoted by six different colours: Geography, Entertainment, History, Arts and Literature, Science and Nature, and Sports.  Essentially, the player makes his way around the board with a pie-shaped playing piece.  Landing on a specific square means that you must answer a specific question, and when you land on one of the more important spaces, you have a chance to earn a piece of the pie.  Once all six pieces are obtained, the player must get the pie back to the center of the game board to win.\rDue to the game's popularity, numerous versions have been made over the years from \"Disney Trivial Pursuit\" to \"Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit\".  Based on the version, the categories for each question set are subject to change.  Two different TV shows have been made in regards to the game. \n"}, {"text": "Exclusive holding over a large industry", "correct": "Monopoly", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMonopoly.\n\n\t\"Monopoly\", created by Parker Brothers in the in 1935, became one of the most profitable board games ever released.  Although many different versions of the game have been released (based around different countries, cities, TV shows, movies, and themes), the basic game has all of its spaces set on different streets in Atlantic City.  In addition, the game has coined certain terms such as 'Passing Go', which has become a well-known cultural phrase.\rIn the game, you select a playing piece and roll two dice to move around the board.  Upon landing on a property, you have the option to buy it or pass, or if it's purchased, you must pay rent to remain there.  While some players prosper in their purchases, others will lose it big landing on the spaces and paying rent.  In addition, many added perks of the game (eg. Passing Go, Chance, Community Chest, and Free Parking) may result in a helpful windfall.  Bankruptcy typically means the end of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Surgical procedure", "correct": "Operation", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOperation.\n\n\t\"Operation\" is played on a special, raised game board containing many small objects.  The goal of the game is to use a pair of special tweezers to pluck the tiny, plastic objects from their respective holes (eg. you can remove 'butterflies from the stomach') without touching the metal sides of each hole.  Once the metal tweezers contact the metal hole, the game board will vibrate and the patient's nose will glow red to signal that your turn is over.  Essentially, the game is based around surgical precision.\rThe game was release by Milton Bradley in 1965.  A PC version of the game was later released as well. \n"}, {"text": "Serpents and runged apparatuses", "correct": "Snakes and Ladders", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnakes and Ladders.\n\n\t\"Snakes and Ladders\" is a very basic board game consisting of a square board with various spaces.  Essentially, a die is rolled to determine the amount of spaces taken.  If the player lands on a snake (or in some versions, a chute), they must take it down to the bottom, thus pushing them further back in the game.  On the other hand, hitting a square containing a ladder will allow the player to climb it to a more advantageous position.  The winner is the player who makes it to the end of the board first.\rAlthough the game was originally released worldwide as \"Snakes and Ladders\", North American players might recognize the title \"Chutes and Ladders\" as the game and title were revised by Milton Bradley in the 1940s. \n"}]}
