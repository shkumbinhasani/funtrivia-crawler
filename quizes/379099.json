When Elizabeth regains consciousness, Sally is still working with a needle and thread, lecturing her about the knick to her femoral artery.

On the fifth day, she tore herself free of her bindings.  Unfortunately, the Hotel Cortez was the only place where she never felt abandoned.  This brings her to The Countess in the basement, because while she doesn't want to spend eternity with The Countess, she does have the ability to bring John back, somehow.

Just as soon as Queenie is about to stab herself in the heart to put an end to the infected woman, she's stabbed by someone else: James March. And while Queenie's regenerative powers would normally save her, March is a ghost, and just as dark as the magic inside her.

She feasts on the witch's blood. \n"}, {"text": "Who becomes the tenth victim of the Ten Commandments Killer?", "correct": "The Countess", "options": ["John Lowe", "Ramona Royale", "Alex Lowe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Countess.\n\n\tJohn, returning home from grabbing a few things (including a person) for dinner, discovers that his entire family isn't in the house.  What he does find, however, is a Hotel Cortez room key.  He returns to the hotel with his finger on the trigger of his gun and stalks the hallways looking for his family.  Reaching Room 64, he finds Sally on the bed waiting for him.  The family is safe, she says, but he needs to fulfill his promise to Mr. March before she can do anything to help...or hinder him.  He has one more commandment left: 'Thou shalt not commit murder'.\rLiz, Iris, and Ramona discuss Ramona's new advantage-- she has witch's blood in her veins.\rThe Countess emerges from her bedroom, still in a fair bit of pain, and finds Ramona waiting for her.  The two discuss what may transpire and The Countess apologizes for everything she's done.  She offers up the Hotel Cortez to Ramona since she no longer wants to be there...and they embrace.

She does arrive to dinner nonetheless, and March explains that he forgives her for turning him in to the police.  That's when Miss Evers reveals that she called the cops; she wanted March for herself and knew that they would be there forever, together.  She begs for anything that she can take with her to feel happiness, to know that he feels any love for her.  Instead, he banishes her from his presence.  A weight seems to be removed from Miss Evers' shoulders, and she departs.  March declares a toast to his and The Countess' eternity together as she begins to cry. \n"}]}
