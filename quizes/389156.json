{"id": "389156", "name": "\"Election Night\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Cult"], "questions": [{"text": "The story of \"Cult\" commences on the U.S. Election Night.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tIt's November 8, 2016, and after a lengthy campaign, the U.S. election for the forty-fifth President comes to a close.  From his basement, Kai Anderson watches as the results are called, whispering that a revolution has begun.  His celebration soon turns to shouting and thrusting at the television.  Kai throws cheese snacks into a blender, heads to a mirror, and pretends to be Donald Trump before visiting his disappointed sister, Winter, in her bedroom and ensuring that they share a pinky promise.\rIn their home, Ally and Ivy Mayfair-Richards watch the broadcast with others.  As the results are confirmed, Ally breaks down.  Their son, Oz, worries that they may not be allowed to be married anymore, but they assure him that things will be fine. \n"}, {"text": "Ally's coulrophobia is triggered by which of these famous clowns?", "correct": "Twisty", "options": ["Pogo", "Pennywise", "Bozo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwisty.\n\n\tUnder the covers of his bed, Oz reads through a comic book about Twisty the Clown where, out in a meadow, a couple, out for a sexy picnic, reflects on the fact that more than fifty years ago, a couple was killed in the exact same spot by the famous, murderous freak.  Ally finds Oz in bed and tells him to hand over the reading material, but she ends up looking at it aghast.  Twisty's face sparks a panic attack that Ivy needs to calm down, and she assures her wife that no matter what the problem is, they'll work through it, even if that means facing Ally's irrational fears. \n"}, {"text": "During a city council meeting, Kai insists that which of these is the key to power?", "correct": "Fear", "options": ["Anger", "Money", "Fame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFear.\n\n\tAt a city council meeting led by Ally and Ivy's neighbour, Mr. Chang, Kai Anderson steps up to discuss extended overtime for police deputies at the Jewish Community Center.  The discussion turns out to be a musing on the build-up of fear, and the city council doesn't really take to it.  Kai insists that the motion doesn't need to pass; there doesn't need to be more cops at a community center. In fact, he suggests there needs to be more chaos; they need to blow it up.  People want to be afraid, he says.  If chaos reigns, the government will have unlimited power.  Kai leaves humiliated as the motion passes. \n"}, {"text": "Ally's trypophobia is triggered by which of the following items in Dr. Benson's office?", "correct": "Coral", "options": ["Frog", "Beehive", "Pumice stone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCoral.\n\n\tAlly heads to her therapist, Dr. Benson, because the anxiety sparked by the election night results continues to trigger all of her old phobias-- clowns, confined spaces, blood, particles in the air.  Even her trypophobia, her fear of small, irregular holes on objects, has reemerged; she criticizes a piece of coral on the doctor's shelf, saying that she'd been managing her distaste for it for the last months. Ally knows that Ivy was what got her through the last time (back when 9/11 happened), and when Obama was elected, things went fine for years.  Dr. Benson prescribes her an anti-anxiety medication and urges her to pull back from things to focus on herself and not things out of her control. \n"}, {"text": "Ally finds herself stalked by clowns in what innocuous location?", "correct": "Supermarket", "options": ["Shopping mall", "Doctor's office", "Library"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSupermarket.\n\n\tAlly heads to the grocery store and finds it's ominously quiet.  The man at the check-out counter explains it's probably because the President has a speech on television before donning his 'Make America Great Again' cap.  As Ally nervously heads down the aisles, she believes she sees clowns in the security mirrors on the ceiling until she finds them-- actually-- in the produce section.  As they advance on her, one actually stalking her with a knife, she flees the supermarket, hops into her car, and calls Ivy.  She doesn't see the clown in her back seat until it's too late, and she drives her vehicle into a lamppost.\rBack at home, Ivy tells Ally that the cashier at the supermarket never saw anything; he never saw any clowns, but he heard Ally screaming and throwing bottles of ros\u00e9.  Ally believes she's being targeted. \n"}, {"text": "According to Ally, Oz's old nanny may have fled back to which country?", "correct": "Guatemala", "options": ["Mexico", "Honduras", "The Philippines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGuatemala.\n\n\tAlly and Ivy, at the butchery they own together, argue that perhaps Ally isn't putting her effort into maintaining their agreement to run the store together and their relationship may be in a bit of a struggle because of it.  Since election day, Ally has only been at the butchery once, and she's supposed to be running the front-of-house while Ivy works in the back.  Ivy just wants Ally to go back to her old self, and their life together is more important than an election.  Ally promises she'll focus and get back to work.\rWhat this means is that they need to hire a new nanny.  Their old nanny fled back to Guatemala as soon as Trump was elected.  Ally says she'll write up an ad. \n"}, {"text": "Did Ally vote for Clinton in the election?", "correct": "No", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNo.\n\n\tAlthough Ally was afraid of Trump winning, she couldn't bring herself to vote for Hillary who, in their state, lost by only 10,000 votes.  Instead, Ally voted for Jill Stein, tipping the scale with a third-party candidate.  This seems to be something Ivy is still hung up about.  As the two of them argue about this on a street corner, they're splashed with coffee by Kai who, walking by, claims he tripped and spilled his latte on them.\rThe applicant that Ally and Ivy get for the nanny position, coincidentally, is Kai's sister, Winter, who impresses the women with her history of babysitting, her time studying women's studies in literature at Vassar, and her work with the Clinton campaign.\rThey don't know the pep talk Winter had with Kai earlier where, bound by their pinky promise, she revealed that she never wanted to kill anyone before, but feared the people who elected Trump and, most of all, Kai himself.\rAlly and Ivy ask Winter when she can start the new job. \n"}, {"text": "Kai provokes which type of people into attacking him so that the footage can later be used against them?", "correct": "Mexican workers", "options": ["Police", "Liberals", "Children"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMexican workers.\n\n\tOut in a street, Kai watches as a group of Mexican workers gather at the back of their truck and he provokes them, singing offensive songs before throwing his own urine at them.  As they attack him, someone films the fight on their phone from a distance.\rWinter spends her first night with Oz asking uncomfortable questions about whether or not Ally or Ivy is his real mom or if he has a father, but notices the boy is drawing pictures of Twisty the Clown killing people.  She asks him if he's ever seen a real dead body.\rAt the butchery, Ally and Ivy have a late night tasting to determine their new menu, but Ally is distracted (by Donald Trump's Twitter account).  When she removes the cloche on her meal, she finds a dish that visually upsets her \n"}, {"text": "Which of these stops outside Ally and Ivy's household?", "correct": "Ice cream truck", "options": ["Army vehicle", "Limousine", "Clown car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce cream truck.\n\n\tAlly, already disturbed by the food brought before her, looks around and spies a clown inside the butchery and it sends her spiralling into her fears.  Ivy hears the smashing of Ally's wine glass from the kitchen and rushes out to help her frantic wife, but insists that no one else could be in there with them.  When Ivy looks under the cloche, she finds exactly what she made-- a spinach souffl\u00e9 with truffle oil, and not the bloody crumpet Ally saw-- and she discovers that Ally hasn't been taking the medicine she was prescribed.\rWinter, meanwhile, shows Oz some videos on the Dark Web, specifically those of people being murdered.  She insists that she's doing it to vaccinate him.  As disturbing as the videos are, she tells him that it'll make him stronger in the end.  While Oz watches videos, he hears a sound outside and looks out the window to find an ice cream truck pulling up at the curb.  Five clowns step out. \n"}, {"text": "The detectives rule that the Changs were killed in which of the following ways?", "correct": "A murder-suicide", "options": ["A ritualistic fashion", "Carbon monoxide leak", "Gang-related circumstances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA murder-suicide.\n\n\tAlly and Ivy argue about medication on the drive home since Ally is worried about messing with her body's internal chemistry.  As they pull up, however, they notice their street has been taped off by the police.  Worried about Oz, they rush in to find that he's okay and in the care of Winter.  The real problem seems to have befallen the Changs next door.\rOz tells his moms that the Changs were killed, and he saw the clowns leave the ice cream truck.  As it turns out, Winter urged him outside and across the road to see what was happening, and peering through the windows of the Chang household, Oz witnessed the gruesome murder occur from start to finish.  When Oz is out of earshot, she insists that none of that happened; they only left the house when the police arrived, but she found the 'Twisty the Clown' comic in his room.  This is when Ivy reveals that Oz has suffered from night terrors in the past.\rA detective later tells the women that they believe the cause to be a murder-suicide.\rThat night, Ally wakes up to hear noises in the house.  When she turns over to wake Ivy, she finds she's in bed with her worst nightmare-- a clown. \n"}]}
