{"id": "403808", "name": "Press 'G' to Start Quiz | Video Games Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture", "Video Game Alphabetics"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these is not a \"Pokemon\" game?", "correct": "Golf", "options": ["Green", "Gold", "Go"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolf.\n\n\tThe \"Pokemon\" game seems to re-up every few years with new generations of the game introducing new Pokemon, new lands, and new concepts, and since its late-1990s debut it's taken on many different forms.  Though not released in North America, \"Pokemon Green\" was amongst the first games (with \"Red\" and \"Blue\" and, eventually, \"Yellow\") and was followed by \"Pokemon Gold\" and \"Pokemon Silver\".  \"Pokemon Go\" was the first \"Pokemon\" mobile game, releasing on devices in 2016. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the final boss of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\"?", "correct": "Ganon", "options": ["Giga-Bowser", "Gerudo", "Goron"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGanon.\n\n\tGanon is a familiar face across all timelines of \"The Legend of Zelda\" as he appears in the majority of games in the series.  This said, in \"Ocarina of Time\" he, as the only male Gerudo of a generation, infiltrated and took over Hyrule Castle, forcing Princess Zelda into exile to reign over the land for seven years. He's fought at the end of the game as Ganondorf but he transforms into Ganon during the last part of the battle.  Ganon returns next in \"Wind Waker\" and then again in \"Twilight Princess\".  He's also a playable character, in Ganondorf form, in \"Super Smash Bros.\" (first appearing in \"Melee\"). \n"}, {"text": "Released by LucasArts in 1998, what PC title was a film noir-style adventure featuring Mexican calaca figures?", "correct": "Grim Fandango", "options": ["Grim Dawn", "Gothic", "Galaga"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrim Fandango.\n\n\tCritically acclaimed, \"Grim Fandango\" was a major PC title in the 1990s known for its humour and unique art-style.  By this point in time, LucasArts was pretty well known for \"Star Wars\" games.  \"Grim Fandango\", however, stood head and shoulders above a bunch of those, returning with restored editions in later decades despite LucasArts being dissolved into Disney's gaming division.  \"Grim Fandango\" took nods from classic cinema as the player took on the role of Manny Calvera passing through the story in the Underworld. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Goldeneye 007\" (N64), what weapon kills with a single bullet?", "correct": "Golden Gun", "options": ["Gravity Gun", "Gunblade", "Gatling Gun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolden Gun.\n\n\tFamously known for being in the James Bond film \"The Man With the Golden Gun\", the Golden Gun featured in this game in multiplayer mode or in the final level of the single player campaign, Egyptian, where it's used to face off against Baron Samedi.  No matter the case, the Golden Gun is a one-hit-kill on another character.  The gun returned in the \"Goldeneye\" remake on the Wii in 2010 and a handful of other James Bond games.  It also appeared in \"Perfect Dark\", another shooter for the N64 made by Rare. \n"}, {"text": "What was the North American name of the Sega console known as 'Mega Drive'?", "correct": "Genesis & Sega Genesis", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenesis & Sega Genesis.\n\n\tThe Genesis was Sega's third home console after the SG-1000 and the Master System.  Releasing in Japan in 1988, the Genesis became the testing ground for what would become Sega's flagship franchises (including \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"!), but it was only known by that name in North America.  It was the Mega Drive everywhere else.  It was well-regarded during its era, appearing as a strong competitor against both the NES and the SNES, but Sega couldn't keep up in proceeding generations with the Saturn and the Dreamcast (especially with Sony jumping in with the PlayStation). \n"}, {"text": "Created with star magic and a small wooden doll, who is the second character to join Mario's party in \"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\"?", "correct": "Geno", "options": ["Garou", "Goro", "Goombario"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeno.\n\n\tGeno was the second original character to join Mario's party in the game (after Mallow) and they were followed shortly thereafter by Bowser and Peach, banding together to defeat Smithy.  Developed by Square (who created \"Final Fantasy\"), \"Super Mario RPG\" was the first such game in the \"Mario\" series (though not the last, since \"Paper Mario\" appeared on the next console) and one of the better-received titles in the same vein.  The game had turn-based battles but operated, much like \"Chrono Trigger\", in a near-3D overworld. \n"}, {"text": "Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago are main characters in what game series originally released on the Xbox 360?", "correct": "Gears of War", "options": ["Grand Theft Auto", "God of War", "Golden Sun"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGears of War.\n\n\tA grittier shooter to accompany \"Halo\" on the Xbox, \"Gears of War\" was developed by Epic Games as a Microsoft exclusive.  Well-received as a franchise, the game was primarily formed to be a one-or-two-player shooter campaign following a story set on an apocalyptic Earth.  As the series developed, more onus was placed on the multiplayer aspect to do the heavy lifting. Nonetheless, the big takeaways from the series were the stories of Marcus and Dom (both of whom were replaced by future characters after the original trilogy) and the weapons featured throughout, like the Lancer (known for its chainsaw component) and the Hammer of Dawn. \n"}, {"text": "You can play as a set of four interchangeable characters traveling through the world of Teyvat in what 2020 online role-playing game?", "correct": "Genshin Impact", "options": ["Guild Wars", "Granblue Fantasy", "Golden Axe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenshin Impact.\n\n\tHitting the RPG scene in mid-to-late 2020, \"Genshin Impact\" bucked the trend of extensive pay-to-win MMORPGs by delivering a mostly-single-player, generally free-to-play experience.  Although up to four players can band together for specific aspects of the game, most of \"Genshin\" is spent shuffling through a party of four characters.  Despite the lack of need to spend in the game, it still became one of the most quickly-profitable titles, at least in the way of micro-transactions, within its first month of launch, becoming hugely popular in China especially. \n"}, {"text": "Which 'G' character fights alongside Sora in \"Kingdom Hearts\"?", "correct": "Goofy", "options": ["Genie", "Grumpy", "Gaston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoofy.\n\n\t\"Kingdom Hearts\" was known for taking elements from both Square Enix's popular \"Final Fantasy\" series and the wonderful world of Disney, so players wouldn't be surprised to be controlling their main character (usually Sora) while battling alongside the melee-focused Goofy (wielding a buckler) and the magically-inclined Donald Duck.  The first \"Kingdom Hearts\" was a PlayStation 2 exclusive which released back in 2002.  Goofy and Donald returned in subsequent main series titles. \n"}, {"text": "Developed for console and handheld systems, what device was used to allow cheats and codes to alter associated games?", "correct": "GameShark", "options": ["GameBlock", "GameGuide", "GameFAQs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGameShark.\n\n\tAlthough a gaming product of yesteryear, GameShark was a fairly popular cheating device throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, being purchasable wherever game peripherals were sold.  Later purchased by MadCatz, the GameShark was a cartridge or disk placed alongside a game in a device which, when booted up, could be used to access cheats or codes and alter software. Although the GameShark could come with pre-loaded codes, players could also obtain new ones from magazines or the Internet (still fledgling in those days), so if you didn't want to actually unlock your way through a game, you could have a bit of an aid. \n"}]}
