{"id": "311044", "name": "\"Diablo II\" - Act II Online Quiz | Diablo Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games D-F", "Diablo Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Who will give you your first quest in Lut Gholein in Act 2?", "correct": "Atma", "options": ["Warriv", "Drognan", "Deckard Cain"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAtma.\n\n\tLut Gholein takes the place of Rogue Encampment in Act 2.  This desert town is your one-stop shopping experience for trading (through Fara, Drognan, and Lysander), identification (through Deckard Cain), and gambling (through Elzix).  Greiz, found near the northern-most entrance to the Sewers, Level 1, will allow you to hire Combat, Offensive, or Defensive mercenaries. Directly adjacent to the city will be the Rocky Waste, the gateway to the desert outside, while entering the Harem in the west end of town will allow you to access the three Palace Floors below.  Atma is the owner of the tavern in the east end of town. Talking to her will result in your accessing the first quest. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the boss found in The Sewers, Level 3 and who must be killed in order to beat the first quest of Act 2?", "correct": "Radament", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadament.\n\n\tEntrances to the Sewers can be found near Greiz in the north and down a set of stairs in the south.  In the three floors of the Sewers, you can find a waypoint in the second and the final boss, Radament, appears in a portion of the third floor.  Radament is the focus of the first quest of the Act, 'Radament's Lair', and defeating him will result in finding the Horadric Scroll, needed in order to begin the second quest through Deckard Cain, and the Book of Skill.  You can get one Book of Skill per difficulty in order to add one skill point to your tree through this.\rThe Sewers, more often than not, will be filled with fire enchanted undead Skeletons. \n"}, {"text": "The Horadric Cube can be found at which location?", "correct": "The Halls of the Dead", "options": ["The Stony Tomb", "Rocky Wastes", "Dry Hills"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Halls of the Dead.\n\n\tOnce you give Deckard Cain the Horadric Scroll found in the Sewers, you can head out of town to the Rocky Wastes, and eventually the Dry Hills.  In the Dry Hills, you'll come across one of the more important dungeons of the Act, the Halls of the Dead.  While a waypoint can be found on Level 2 of the Halls, the Horadric Cube, one of the most popular, memorable items of \"Diablo II\", can be found on the third floor.  In order to claim it, you'll usually need to defeat Bloodwitch the Wild, a unique Huntress.\rThe Horadric Cube is the first step in completing the second quest of the Act, though it can be kept with you throughout the entire game and proceeding difficulties.  By placing items inside, you can use it as a storage or to transmute and combine items into more powerful/alternate devices.  For example, placing three Rejuvenation Potions into the Cube and transmuting will result in a Full Rejuvenation Potion. \n"}, {"text": "The Staff of Kings is found in the Maggot's Lair.  The Maggot's Lair is found in the Far Oasis.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tContinuing on with the second quest in Act 2, you'll need to head from Dry Hills to the Far Oasis to find the bug-infested tunnel system known as the Maggot Lair.  Here, weaving your way through the narrow passages, you'll need to make your way through three different levels of corridors filled with swarms of bugs, large eggsac-laying maggots, and more to find the Staff of Kings, located within a golden chest in the final grand chamber containing Coldworm the Burrower, known for her rather large stature (I mean, she can't even get up to move) and her Cold Enchantment. Of course, this isn't the only piece of the puzzle necessary to finish the second quest of the act. You'll need to go even further into the desert to do that.  There is no waypoint in the Maggot Lair; the closest one is in the Far Oasis. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the third quest of Act 2?", "correct": "Tainted Sun", "options": ["Sand's End", "The Lost City", "The Viper Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTainted Sun.\n\n\t'Tainted Sun' begins the moment you step out of the Far Oasis and into the Lost City.  This area, populated by Hunters and Plague Bearers, will darken the moment you step in and you will be prompted to ask Drognan for answers.  As it turns out, Claw Vipers in the nearby (and aptly-named) Valley of the Snakes are blocking out the sun and screwing up the desert ecosystem we now hold so dear. Jumping into Claw Viper Temple and defeating your way through Salamanders and Claw Vipers alike is the only way to ensure that the blazing, hot sun is restored back to its glory.  When you reach the Altar of the Sun on the lowest floor of the Temple, you will need to destroy it to bring about the end of the permanent eclipse. \n"}, {"text": "What must be combined with the Staff of Kings in the Horadric Cube to make the Staff of Kings?", "correct": "The Amulet of the Viper", "options": ["The Clasp of the Viper", "The Greaves of the Viper", "The Ring of the Viper"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Amulet of the Viper.\n\n\tThe Amulet of the Viper is only found at the end of the Claw Viper Temple in the Valley of the Snakes so in a technical sense, the best time to pick it up is when you're bursting through the area to finish up the 'Tainted Sun' quest.  When you break the Altar of the Sun and defeat the unique Claw Viper known as Fangskin, the Amulet of the Viper will drop and it can be transmuted with the Staff of Kings to create the fabled Horadric Staff.\rOf course, while the second quest of the Act, 'The Horadric Staff', may have all of its components together at last, you're still not done it. \n"}, {"text": "To access the fourth quest, 'The Arcane Sanctuary', you need to gain access to the palace in Lut Gholein.  Who is the Lord of this city?", "correct": "Jerhyn", "options": ["Elzix", "Meshif", "Lysander"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJerhyn.\n\n\tBy speaking to Drognan, the magic dealer, after you finish the Tainted Sun quest, Jerhyn will think to open up his palace to visitors and you'll come to realize that none of the city's living inhabitants should be going anywhere near it.  Ducking into the Harem and the Palace Cellars.  When you finally reach the third Palace Cellar (there's a waypoint on the first floor) you'll need to make your way to the center of the floor to find a portal guarded by an Invader named Fire Eye.  This portal will most certainly lead you to the Arcane Sanctuary, a magical world created in a different dimension by the mage Horazon. Another waypoint can be found at the entrance of the Sanctuary, directly in the middle of intersecting paths leading to four different corners of the map. \n"}, {"text": "The Summoner is found in the Arcane Sanctuary.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe fifth quest of the game culminates to the point where you reach the correct corner of the mystical Arcane Sanctuary, a dimensional plane populated by Ghoul Lords, Spectres, and other odd creatures and where the laws of architecture and reason need not apply.  The Summoner is the person to beat here and his strong Cold Enchantments will make it all the more difficult.  Once you defeat this unique enemy, you'll be able to read Horazon's journal and proceed onwards to the sixth and final quest of the Act in a secluded part of the desert.\rLike The Countess in Act 1, The Summoner has a chance of dropping the Key of Hate, used to further your adventures after completing the game. \n"}, {"text": "How many different tombs can be found in the Canyon of the Magi?", "correct": "Seven", "options": ["Nine", "Eight", "Ten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeven.\n\n\tA portal found at the end of the Arcane Sanctuary will take you directly to the Act's final waypoint in the Canyon of the Magi, a closed-off desert location containing seven tombs (which form the basis for the title of the sixth quest, the cleverly-named 'The Seven Tombs').  In order to determine which one is, in fact, the tomb that fits you best, you'll need to complete the 'Arcane Sanctuary' and 'The Summoner' quests and read Horazon's Journal which gives the proper symbol that leads you into the correct tomb. Tal Rasha's Tomb is only one floor, but the correct tomb is rather expansive.  At the end, you can finish your second quest, 'The Horadric Staff', and place the Horadric Staff into the Orifice provided. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the final boss of Act 2?", "correct": "Duriel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuriel.\n\n\tAs soon as the Horadric Staff is placed into the Orifice in Tal Rasha's Tomb, Tal Rasha's Chamber (a small room home to the second act's final boss, Duriel), is opened.  Duriel, well known for his speed and strength, was often regarded as one of the more difficult bosses of \"Diablo II\" until patches proceeded to drag down his stats.  Upon defeating Duriel, the sixth and final quest of Act 2, 'The Seven Tombs', will be complete and you'll be able to head further west to Kurast Docks.  Speaking to Jerhyn and then Meshif in Lut Gholein will allow you to head straight over the Act 3. \n"}]}
