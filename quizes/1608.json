{"id": "1608", "name": "10 Average Questions about Basic Genetics", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", " Health and Human Biology", "Reproduction and Genetics"], "questions": [{"text": "The 'instructions' contained in every cell that has a nucleus are 'written' in...", "correct": "DNA", "options": ["Mitochondria", "Sugars", "T-RNA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDNA.\n\n\tShort for 'deoxyribonucleic acid.' \n"}, {"text": "Humans have how many total chromosomes?", "correct": "46", "options": ["48", "42", "34"], "explanation": "\n\n\n46.\n\n\tIn pairs- 23 of them. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following creatures has the most chromosomes?", "correct": "Goldfish", "options": ["Human", "Fruit fly", "Dog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoldfish.\n\n\tYep...goldfish have 96! \n"}, {"text": "Humans have two chromosomes that determine sex- X and Y. Which of the following karyotypes (chromosome types) would be a normal female?", "correct": "XX", "options": ["XXY", "XY", "YY"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXX.\n\n\tXY is male. YY doesn't exist. XXY is a male with the genetic disorder Klinefelter's syndrome. \n"}, {"text": "Most nasty genetic disorders are recessive- you need two bad copies of the gene to come down with the disease. Some are dominant- if you have just one of the bad genes, you will get the disease. Which of the following disorders has dominant inheritance?", "correct": "Huntington's chorea", "options": ["Tay-Sach's disease", "Phenylketonuria", "Cystic fibrosis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuntington's chorea.\n\n\tHuntington's is a progressive disorder of the brain that does not appear until late in life- after the victims have already passed the bad gene on to their children. It killed singer Woody Guthrie. \n"}, {"text": "In Venetian Floozies, purple stripe color is autosomally dominant over pink. If you mate a male purple striped Floozy that does not carry the pink gene to a female pink Floozy, what percentage of the offspring would you expect to have purple stripes?", "correct": "100 percent", "options": ["50 percent", "0 percent", "25 percent"], "explanation": "\n\n\n100 percent.\n\n\tAll of the offspring will be purple Floozies that carry the pink gene. If P stands for purple and p for pink, the male would have the genotype PP and the female pp. All their offspring would be Pp. \n"}, {"text": "Who discovered the basics of genetics while pottering around in the garden?", "correct": "Gregor Mendel", "options": ["Charles Darwin", "Albert Einstein", "James Watson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGregor Mendel.\n\n\tWorking with peas, Mendel (who was a monk) discovered the basic laws of inheritance but was ignored by his fellow scientists. His work was later rediscovered. \n"}, {"text": "Watson and Crick won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of...", "correct": "The structure of DNA", "options": ["The inheritance pattern of Tay-Sachs disease", "Mitosis", "The protein coding system of RNA"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe structure of DNA.\n\n\tThey discovered that it was shaped like a spiral- thus the title of Watson's book 'The Double Helix'. \n"}, {"text": "Some genetic disorders are maintained in a population because, if an individual has only one bad copy of the gene, some survival advantage is maintained. People with just one copy of a particular mutated gene are protected from malaria. If they have two bad copies of the same gene, they have the disease...", "correct": "Sickle cell anemia", "options": ["Hemophilia", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Muscular dystrophy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSickle cell anemia.\n\n\tIt's thought that the gene changes red blood cell shapes enough that the malaria parasite cannot live in them. \n"}, {"text": "When the cell is not busy dividing, the chromosomes 'unwind and relax'. What are they called when they are in this form?", "correct": "Chromatin", "options": ["Plasmids", "Endoplasmic reticulum", "Chloroplasts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChromatin.\n\n"}]}
