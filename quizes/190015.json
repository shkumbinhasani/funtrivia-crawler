What is this colonel's fitting surname?", "correct": "Bloodworth", "options": ["Battle", "Gunnerson", "Kilman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBloodworth.\n\n\tColonel Bloodworth is ably played by Charles Aidman.  Bloodworth seems a fitting name for a man who tallies casualty rates.  Interestingly, one of the most interesting 'M*A*S*H' scriptwriters was named Linda Bloodworth.  Coincidence?  Perhaps not!  Contrast the name Bloodworth to 'Aidman', the actor's real name, and the intrigue gets even deeper. \n"}, {"text": "While the Colonel regales the doctors with his morbid statistics, what incredibly mundane activity do Hawkeye and BJ engage in (most likely to show their contempt for the Colonel)?", "correct": "Rolling a ball of yarn", "options": ["Cleaning bedpans", "Knitting socks", "Counting tongue depressors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRolling a ball of yarn.\n\n\tWhile Colonel Bloodworth tallies up the estimated casualties for Hill 403, Hawkeye and BJ busy themselves with a some red yarn.  When they get a chance, they mock Bloodworth by asking what will be expected from Hills 404-406.  Bloodworth is undaunted, announcing that the 4077th should expect nearly 300 casualties in the next 24 hours.  According to Bloodworth, 'War is a science'. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the Swamp, Hawkeye and BJ encounter Charles just at the right moment.  It seems that Charles has received a lovely care package from home, complete with all of the delicacies Charles has been missing.

When the ask what is next on the menu Charles refers them to the mess tent, unwilling to further share the rest of his sumptuous little buffet.  'One lousy piece of liverwurst and that's it?' complains BJ. \n"}, {"text": "Charles is annoyed by the begging of his two tent-mates and decides to take his luxurious picnic outside the Swamp.  He settles in Margaret's tent where he shares his gastronomic feast with the lovely Hot Lips.

To wash it all down they enjoy a Montrachet 1947.  Charles insists that when they eat the pheasant they use their hands, the 'barbaric approach', as Charles puts it. \n"}, {"text": "Margaret and Charles' feast is interrupted by an intercom notice; the wounded have arrived.  Not having time for petit fours, the two majors join the rest of the gang in the O.R.  Unfortunately, they have become sick from one of the food items they had greedily consumed earlier.  Of Charles or Margaret, which one passes out while at the operating table?", "correct": "Charles", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles.\n\n\tCharles complains that the air in the O.R. is 'foul', to which Margaret replies that it was the pheasant that was foul.  Margaret insists angrily that they ate a 'rotten bird', but Charles denies this all the way towards the operating floor.  Margaret seems to be in better shape, only suffering from a bout of hiccups. \n"}, {"text": "After the O.R. session Hawkeye gloats a great deal.

Hawkeye can't help but gloat in Bloodworth's face.  Unfortunately, while Hawkeye relishes his small victory over Bloodworth, more wounded are announced over the intercom. \n"}, {"text": "When another shipment of wounded is suddenly announced over the loudspeakers, Hawkeye is jarred back to reality.

Hawkeye becomes incensed by the Colonel's misguided pride, calling him a 'grim reaper' and referring to the ledge upon which his estimates have been made as his...?", "correct": "Diary of Death", "options": ["Notepad from Hell", "Book of the Dead", "Apocalyptic Scratch Pad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiary of Death.\n\n\t'You make me sick.' says Hawkeye, 'The way you reduce human life to cold equations.  God, I hate that.  And I hate your rotten ledger, your diary of death.  But what I hate the most, you grim reaper, is that you actually love your job.'  Hawkeye then proceeds to grab Bloodworth by the shirt and tosses him against a wall in the officer's club. \n"}, {"text": "In the post-op tent Klinger meets with a wounded soldier named Danker who is a fellow Toledoan.  Danker was in Toledo not two weeks before this moment, and Klinger claims he can smell a hot dog from what restaurant on Danker's breath?", "correct": "Tony Packo's", "options": ["Norman's", "Top Dog", "Der Wienerschnitzel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTony Packo's.\n\n\tKlinger claims that he can smell one of Tony Packo's Hungarian hot dogs on Danker's breath, and guesses that he had mustard, chili and hot peppers to top the hot dog.  'Amazing', responds Danker.  Danker claims to live on 'Locust and Ontario', while Klinger lives on 'Michigan and Galena'.  They discuss 'The Trianon', a dance hall that both frequent on occasion.  Danker hands Klinger a matchbook from that very place.  'Matches made in heaven.  I'll keep them forever.' Klinger says, thanking Danker with misty eyes. \n"}, {"text": "Back in the Swamp, BJ receives a special gift from a kid he helped patch up in the O.R.

Unfortunately for Charles, he passed out in mid-surgery and BJ had to take over.  This does not stop Charles from attempting to lay claim to the flight jacket.  The two settle things by asking Colonel Potter to decide which of them should receive the coat.  It turns out that neither get to keep the jacket, it is way too small for both of them.  Colonel Potter, on the other hand, is happy with his new leather! \n"}, {"text": "A further shipment of wounded arrive after another lull, and Hawkeye is surprised to find that the Colonel he has physically confronted is part of the wounded.  Despite the Colonel's wishes, Hawkeye is the surgeon who handles his case.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tHawkeye has spent the entire episode denigrating Colonel Bloodworth's work, and now the Colonel sees that his life might possibly be in Hawkeye's hands.  Naturally, Bloodworth is hopeful that Hawkeye will not be the surgeon working on him, and indeed Charles is the doctor who performs the operation.  While Bloodworth is being worked on, he notices Hawkeye's diligence.  Following his surgery he decides not to press charges against Hawkeye.\r Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try my other 'M*A*S*H'-related stuff. \n"}]}
