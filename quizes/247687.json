After he's finished, Radar receives a standing ovation from the people in line.  When he asks Hawkeye if he has understood the rules as described to him, Hawkeye responds, 'Just as sure as you're one-foot high, Radar!'  Radar responds in an annoyed whisper: 'Cut that out!'\r Klinger adds to the amusement with his appearance in a lovely fur coat.

Hawkeye responds, 'How long have you had this delusion that you're human?'  When Radar arrives with Father Mulcahy, and announces his arrival to Hawkeye, Captain Sloan quickly snaps, 'Siddown, shorty.'  Both Radar and Father Mulcahy immediately sit down.

Captain Sloan claims.  A dumbfounded Henry chimes in, 'Boy, I wish I knew what was going on.'  Radar responds, 'I'll tell you later, sir.'  Henry retorts, 'You always say that, Radar, but you never do.'  And they live happily ever after.\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it! \n"}]}
