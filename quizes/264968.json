{"id": "264968", "name": "Superhero Science Quiz | Topics for Kids | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Science for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the very first superheroes was Superman, the Man of Steel, and one of his most exciting powers is his ability to fly. What's the name of the natural force that keeps ordinary people down to earth?", "correct": "Gravity", "options": ["Electricity", "Tidal waves", "Magnetism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGravity.\n\n\tGravity is a force that pulls objects together. It's what makes the Earth orbit the Sun and the Moon orbit the Earth -- it even pulls you a little closer to your computer, but so weakly that you can't feel it! The gravitational force between us and the Earth is what keeps us on the ground. \n"}, {"text": "After Peter Parker was bitten by a special spider, he gained many of the spider's abilities and became Spider-Man. What type of animal is a spider?", "correct": "Arachnid", "options": ["Crustacean", "Insect", "Mammal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArachnid.\n\n\tA spider might be hairy, but that doesn't make it a mammal! It's an arachnid, not an insect; the easiest way to tell is that it has eight legs, not six. \n"}, {"text": "Magneto's amazing powers come from his ability to change and use magnetic fields. Which of these things would be affected the most by Magneto's powers?", "correct": "A steel paper clip", "options": ["A large diamond", "A piece of paper", "A pair of pants"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA steel paper clip.\n\n\tMagnetic fields are very powerful, but they work best on certain types of things. Iron responds very strongly to magnetism, and since steel contains a lot of iron, those paper clips will be easy for Magneto to control! \n"}, {"text": "From Violet (\"The Incredibles\") to the Invisible Woman (\"The Fantastic Four\"), many superheroes have the ability not to be seen. When Violet is visible, how do people see her?", "correct": "Light bounces off of Violet and into their eyes.", "options": ["Violet gives off light (like a light bulb) which goes into their eyes.", "Light shines from their eyes onto Violet.", "They don't really ever see her; they just think that they do."], "explanation": "\n\n\nLight bounces off of Violet and into their eyes.\n\n\tThis is why you see better when there's a lot of light around! Light (from the sun, a light bulb or a fire) hits objects and people and bounces into your eyes, allowing your brain to figure out what you're looking at. \n"}, {"text": "Daredevil is blind, but he uses sound to \"see\" the shapes of objects, like sonar. What other things use sonar to \"see\"?", "correct": "Bats and submarines", "options": ["Bees and cell phones", "Eagles and television sets", "Electric eels and ambulances"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBats and submarines.\n\n\tWhen the sounds made by a sonar system hit something and bounce back, the bat (or submarine) will hear them. They can tell from the echo how far away something is, how big it is and even (sometimes) what shape it is! \n"}, {"text": "The Flash runs very, very quickly, but according to science there's something that's even faster. What is the fastest thing in the universe?", "correct": "Light", "options": ["Our galaxy", "Sound", "A supernova explosion"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLight.\n\n\tAlbert Einstein's Theory of Relativity says that nothing can move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum (like space). Luckily, this still leaves room for the Flash to move very, very fast: the speed of light is 186,000 miles (or 300,000 kilometers) per second! Sometimes, the Flash is shown running even faster than light, but even comic book writers can't get the science right all the time. \n"}, {"text": "The amazing powers of the X-Men come from genetic mutations. Frequent mutations are a very important part of what process in biology?", "correct": "Evolution", "options": ["Extinction", "Food chain", "Breathing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvolution.\n\n\tEvolution slowly changes a species as individuals with helpful mutations have more children than \"normal\" individuals without those mutations. It's always happening -- even today -- but usually over such a long time that we don't notice it. \n"}, {"text": "The Incredible Hulk gained his powers after a blast from a radioactive bomb he had built. Do radioactive objects ever appear in nature?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tYou might think of radioactivity as coming from a nuclear bomb or power plant, but even bombs and power plants use radioactive elements (like uranium) from nature. A radioactive element will decay into a lighter element, giving off energy. \n"}, {"text": "Iron Man lives inside metal armor that allows him to perform incredible feats. Many animals also keep their skeletons on the outside of their bodies. What is such a skeleton called?", "correct": "Exoskeleton", "options": ["Bones-around", "Otorhinolaryngology", "Cell membrane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExoskeleton.\n\n\tMany animals, including insects, spiders and lobsters, keep the hardest parts of their body on the outside in an exoskeleton. People have endoskeletons (skeletons inside the body) -- and, of course, Iron Man has both! \n"}, {"text": "Many superheroes have fought against the Kree, the Skrull, and other powerful aliens from other galaxies. What is the name of our galaxy?", "correct": "The Milky Way", "options": ["Earth", "The Solar System", "Andromeda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Milky Way.\n\n\tA galaxy is a group of between ten million and a trillion stars, traveling together through the universe. Our solar system (the Sun, Earth, and the other planets) is only a very tiny part of our galaxy, the Milky Way -- and there are countless other galaxies in the universe. The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest to us out of all these other galaxies. \n"}]}
