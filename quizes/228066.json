His family is a collection of basket cases and his wheels for the big camping date with his girlfriend have been wrecked.  In addition, his best friend is a wigged-out Albert Einstein-wannabe.  Which movie is being described here?", "correct": "Back to the Future", "options": ["Sneakers", "E.T.", "Short Circuit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBack to the Future.\n\n\t1985's 'Back to the Future' certainly taught us a lot about how to solve teen problems.  One merely has to go back to 1955 when one's parents were teens, wreck any chances of said parents getting together, and then spend the rest of one's time mending said relationship.  Yes, all one needs is a time machine and all one's problems are solved! \n"}, {"text": "Chris Chambers is the younger brother of a local tough.

What is the name of this unusually non-troubled teen?", "correct": "Ferris Bueller", "options": ["Carl von Patten", "Scott McWorthy", "Milhouse Peterman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFerris Bueller.\n\n\t'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is perhaps director John Hughes chef-d'oeuvre.

Just go for it!  Though he is essentially a nobody in high school, he gains the nerve to ask the senior class valedictorian, Diane Court, to accompany him to the big graduation party.  From there, their relationship actually develops into something special, despite some stumbles along the way.  What Cameron Crowe-directed movie chronicles their first days together?", "correct": "Say Anything", "options": ["One Crazy Summer", "Class Reunion", "Boys and Girls"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSay Anything.\n\n\tLloyd Dobler and Diane Court came to life thanks to the authentic performances of the two lead actors in the film, John Cusack and Ione Skye, respectively.  And to think, it could have been Kirk Cameron in the Lloyd Dobler role. \n"}, {"text": "In the surreality of this film, most of the popular girls in school share a given name, jocks rule with an iron fist, rebellious young men tote guns and explosives and croquet is the game of choice for today's youth.

The movie, about a group of students and their wild times at a California high school, features stand-out performances by Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Ray Walston, Vincent Schiavelli and several others.  It is, to put it simply, a teen classic.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it. \n"}]}
