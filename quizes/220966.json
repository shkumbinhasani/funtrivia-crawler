{"id": "220966", "name": "\"Super Mario 64\" - One Per Level Trivia Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Mario Games", "Super Mario 64"], "questions": [{"text": "In \"Bob-omb Battlefield\", can you find a warp-spot?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tThere are actually two warp-spots in the entire level.  The first one is in two flower gardens.  One of these is near the Koopa at the cannon in the middle of the field, and another is in the field across the bridge near the Chain Chomp.  The second set of warp-points are in the mountain.  In either of the two caves in the side of the mountain, move right to the back and remain motionless.  You will then warp to the next cave.  This is very useful in the race with Koopa the Quick. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Whomp's Fortress\", where can you find Hoot the Owl?", "correct": "In a tree", "options": ["In a cage", "At the top of the fortress", "On a pole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a tree.\n\n\tAfter obtaining the first two stars in the level, you can find Hoot the Owl in the tree next to the starting point.  If you wake him up, he will fly you to the fifth star of the level.  Once you're holding onto his talons, you can control him to fly you over a small cage containing the star.  When you're confident that you can land into it, you can drop down and claim the star. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Jolly Roger Bay\", how many treasure chests can be found inside the sunken ship?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["Five", "Three", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tIn order to enter the sunken ship, you need to lure Unagi the seal out, and then enter through his window.

There are also four chests inside a cave in this level, and you open them with the same combination that you used in the ship.  Once again, the prize is a star. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Cool, Cool Mountain\", how many red coins are found on the slide (within the mountain)?", "correct": "None", "options": ["Three", "One", "Two"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNone.\n\n\tAll of the red coins are scattered throughout the outdoor portion of the level.

In this level, you can still hit the Blue Coin switch, and you can also get a Blue Coin from the solitary Mr. I who is visible from the starting point of the level.  If you're going for the 100-Coin Star in this level, be sure to get these Blue Coins and the Koopa Shell.  With the Koopa Shell, you can ride over the lava and collect the hard-to-reach coins.

If this happens, you'll need to start again. \n"}]}
