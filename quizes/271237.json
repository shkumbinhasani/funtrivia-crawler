{"id": "271237", "name": "Meet Me in Hyrule Quiz | Zelda Games | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "Which character gives Link the Golden Cucco?", "correct": "Rusl", "options": ["Jaggle", "Colin", "Bo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRusl.\n\n\tRusl is from Link's hometown of Ordon Village and whenever Link needs a helping hand, Rusl seems to be there.  The Golden Cucco is one such instance.  When Link needs to return to the ruins of the Temple of Time to repower the Master Sword and reach the past Temple of Time, Rusl will be waiting outside the Forest Temple with a Golden Cucco, which Link can use to fly to the Sacred Forest.  Rusl is first seen with Link in the opening cutscene of the game. \n"}, {"text": "The Wooden Charm is given to which character?", "correct": "Ilia", "options": ["Pergie", "Impaz", "None of these"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIlia.\n\n\tAfter Link makes his way through the Hidden Village north of the Bridge of Eldin, he can receive this charm that can be given to Ilia in Kakariko Village.  The Wooden Charm can restore Ilia's memory and she will give it back to you to use as a Horse Call.  With this, Epona will come to you all over Hyrule Field.  Ilia and Link seem to have a more-than-friendship relationship in Ordon Village.  Her father is the mayor, and she is the last of the youths to be found during Link's twilit journey. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these children is the youngest?", "correct": "Malo", "options": ["Beth", "Talo", "Colin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalo.\n\n\tThese four children are capture along with Ilia in the beginning of the game.  Link finds all four of the youngsters in Kakariko Village in the care of Renado and Barnes.  Malo, the youngest of the group, is perhaps the most mature and perplexing.  After you rid Eldin Province of twilight, Malo will open a store known as Malo Mart where you can buy helpful items like the Hawkeye and Hylian Shield. If you so choose, you can help Malo set up a new shop in Hyrule Castle Town.  This will run the old owners out of business and you'll be able to purchase the Magic Armor at a much more affordable price. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the character that is found in the first seven dungeons of the game?", "correct": "Ooccoo & Ooccoo Jr & Ooccoo Junior", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOoccoo & Ooccoo Jr & Ooccoo Junior.\n\n\tOoccoo is one odd creature.  Her and her son Ooccoo Jr. will be found in the first seven temples of the game.  In the first five, you can use Ooccoo and her son to warp you out of a dungeon (much like Farore's Wind in \"Ocarina of Time\").  In the Temple of Time, they will go off to find a way to reach their home, and in City in the Sky, you will take them home in the Oocca cannon at Lake Hylia.  In this dungeon, you can meet numerous members of the Oocca tribe, and you can use them like you would a Cucco...by holding onto them and leaping off structures. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Renado's daughter?", "correct": "Luda", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLuda.\n\n\tLuda is found in Kakariko Village helping her father take care of the kids from Ordon Village.  Although she only plays a minor role in the game, her father, the shaman of Kakariko Village, plays a major role.  Renado will be responsible for helping nurse the Zora prince back to health as well as take care of Ilia while she tries to regain her memory.  It is implied during the game that the owner of a certain bar in Hyrule Castle Town has a crush on him. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Gorons is not found within the Goron Mines?", "correct": "Gor Coron", "options": ["Gor Amoto", "Gor Liggs", "Gor Ebizo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGor Coron.\n\n\tInstead, Gor Coron is found within Death Mountain and you must battle him in order to gain entry to the Goron Mines.  To gain an audience, you'll need to ascend the mountain, but to do that, you'll need to get back to Ordon Village and acquire the Iron Boots in a duel with Mayor Bo.  Once these boots are claimed, you can actually face off against the Goron.  The other three Gorons are responsible for giving Link the Key Shards that make the Boss Key of the dungeon. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the King of Darkness who is fought in the Palace of Twilight?", "correct": "Zant", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZant.\n\n\tZant is an evil person.  Fair and square.  After deciding that he wanted to take the throne in the Palace of Twilight for himself, he sought help from an evil deity and brought both worlds into utter chaos.  When you reach the Palace of Twilight with the Master Sword, you can imbue it with the power of light and face off against the so-called 'king' of the darkness in the throne room and beyond.  Zant will be watching your progress through Hyrule, so recall your past battles to beat him. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Louise's owner?", "correct": "Telma", "options": ["Pergie", "Sera", "Uli"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelma.\n\n\tTelma is the owner of the bar in Hyrule Castle Town and you will need to visit this location many times in the game.  The site is notable for being the location where you find Ilia in the twilight.  Here, you also see Prince Ralis for the first time and you can find a route into Hyrule Castle.  Telma's cat, Louise, is also an important figure.  If you happen to be in wolf form, you'll be able to converse with her and find certain objects that will help you on the quest. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the late Zora Queen?", "correct": "Rutela", "options": ["Ralis", "Agitha", "Renado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRutela.\n\n\tWhen you reach Zora's Domain, you will encounter the ghost of the late Queen Rutela.  She will ask you to help her son, Prince Ralis, who can be found in Hyrule Castle Town at Telma's Bar.  When twilight is lifted from Lanayru Province, you can help Telma and Ilia take Ralis out of the city in a caravan.  This trip will take you all around the south end of Hyrule Field to Kakariko Village resulting in another fight with the King Bulblin and his forces. \n"}, {"text": "Falbi runs the cannon on Lake Hylia.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tFyer is actually the character running the cannon operation on the waters of Lake Hylia in eastern Hyrule.  Falbi operates the Flight-By-Fowl mini-game overlooking the majestic lake.  In this game, you hold onto a Cucco and fly over the lake to collect rupees.  However, this is also the only way that you can make your way onto the tiers of the Isle of Riches and claim the Piece of Heart spinning on a platform at the top. Simply follow the rupees to the right to reach it.  Fyer, on the other hand, is more crucial to the plot of the game.  He will repair the Oocca Cannon when you need to reach the City in the Sky. \n"}, {"text": "Which character gives Link two different Bomb Bags?", "correct": "Iza", "options": ["Hena", "Coro", "Jaggle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIza.\n\n\tIza is quite the entrepreneur of the family, helming the Rapid Ride experience outside Zora's Domain.  First, you receive a Bomb Bag from her for destroying rock slides on the rapid course, and secondly, you receive the Giant Bomb Bag by scoring at least twenty-five points on the Rapid Ride mini-game.  Iza is related to Coro and Hena. Hena, at least, has made something of herself, opting to rent out boats at the fishing center near the River Rapid rides.  Coro, on the other hand, lives in a hut in Faron Woods, and although Link obtains the Lantern from him, it appear that he's not following in the footsteps of his other siblings. Jaggle is Malo and Talo's father.  He's found in Ordon Village. \n"}, {"text": "Link needs to collect bugs around Hyrule for which character?", "correct": "Agitha", "options": ["Talo", "Midna", "Coro"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAgitha.\n\n\tAgitha just confuses me.  Living amongst the modestly non-impoverished houses within Hyrule Castle Town, Agitha actually resides in her own small castle.  Despite the fact that she must be quite young, she insists on being called a princess and she lives alone in a house which, if Link is successful, will also house twenty-four golden bugs from around Hyrule. Luckily, Agitha must have inheritance or something, because every bug returned to her will result in a nice sum of cash.  As well, once Link successfully completes the task of retrieving all of the bugs, Agitha will hand over the Giant Wallet, effectively raising Link's money storage to one thousand rupees. \n"}, {"text": "Gengle is the cat owned by which Hyrule Castle Town resident?", "correct": "Jovani", "options": ["Borville", "Telma", "Shad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJovani.\n\n\tJovani and Gengle are a weird duo.  Overcome by greed and the need for immense wealth, Jovani sold his soul and was transformed against his will into gold and jewels.  As Link makes his way around Hyrule, he can defeat Poes and claim their souls to bring Jovani and Gengle back to their regular state.  After Link defeats all sixty of these Poes, Jovani will give him a Silver Rupee, worth two hundred green ones. With his newfound freedom, Jovani will head to the bar while Gengle will continue to give away the riches that they've been given.  If Link makes his way to any field, he can return to Hyrule Castle Town to receive an additional Silver Rupee as a reward. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters is met first?", "correct": "Yeto", "options": ["Yeta", "Both are met at the same time", "Link meets neither of these in the game"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYeto.\n\n\tBefore departing for the fifth dungeon, Snowpeak Ruins, Link will need to obtain the Reekfish Scent in Zora's Domain (using a Coral Earring) and follow it to the highest point of Peak Province.  Once Link makes it there, he will encounter Yeto, who recently ate the Reekfish that Link followed the scent of.  Surprised by his presence, Yeto asks for Link's assistance at his home, which turns out to be the dungeon Link is looking for. Link meets Yeta for the first time in a cozy den in front of a fireplace, and throughout the course of the dungeon, Link will encounter both characters for assistance. Yeta will alter transform into this dungeon's boss, Blizzeta, and after the battle, they will offer to race you down Snowpeak Mountain on frozen leaves of a nearby tree. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Link meet Impaz?", "correct": "Hidden Village", "options": ["Kakariko Village", "Hyrule Castle Town", "City in the Sky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHidden Village.\n\n\tImpaz is the final resident of the Hidden Village and she resides there with quite a few of her feline friends.  During Link's first visit to the village, he will encounter a group of Bulblins that he will need to defeat to rescue the sole resident.  After a bout of trading involving certain items, Link will regain the use of his Dominion Rod, which is needed to find the Oocca Cannon in Kakariko Village. Impaz is the one who helped Ilia find her way to freedom after being captured by the Bulblin brigade, and after Link speaks with her, she will remain to guard the village.  After Link's encounter with her, the village will be home to a minigame that involves searching for twenty different cats. \n"}]}
