{"id": "103523", "name": "Very Challenging Movie Roles Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common"], "questions": [{"text": "In their only film in which they played the two starring roles together, actors Steve McQueen and Paul Newman performed their own stunts.  What was the name of the great action blockbuster that included these two names in the marquee?", "correct": "The Towering Inferno", "options": ["The Great Escape", "Bullitt", "Hud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Towering Inferno.\n\n\tIn a case of 'anything you can do, I can do better' these two acting rivals both insisted on performing their own stunts...macho men!  It seems that Steve McQueen in particular took their rivalry seriously, insisting that he receive equal pay, equal billing and even an equal number of lines in the film!  Newman seems to have accepted McQueen's name at the top of the billing, being the ranch dressing making, popcorn, corn chip and pretzel producing madman that he is! \n"}, {"text": "A quiz such as this one would not be complete without including a question involving Jackie Chan.  This Hong Kong born martial arts superstar has starred in a multitude of incredibly filmed action movies, all of which include his marvelous stunts.  This extraordinary action fighter and master of stunt work has starred in several films produced in the United States, but which was his first credited role in a film produced and filmed in the United States?", "correct": "The Big Brawl", "options": ["Cannonball Run", "Rumble in the Bronx", "City Hunter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Big Brawl.\n\n\tIn 1980 Jackie Chan appeared in the low budget film, 'The Big Brawl', created by the producers of 'Enter the Dragon'.  The following year, he appeared in the original 'Cannonball Run', and reappeared in the 1984 sequel (yikes!)  He actually had an uncredited role in 'Enter the Dragon', a 1973 film co-produced in the United States and starring the all time martial arts hero Bruce Lee, but that doesn't count in terms of my question. Jackie has been nearly killed several times during the filming of his wonderful movies...which shows his dedication to his trade (and perhaps a touch of madness?)  To truly understand the extent of the danger he faces during the filming of his movies (especially the Hong Kong based films) take a look at the outtakes at the end of these films. Needless to say, he has a difficult time getting himself insured! \n"}, {"text": "Eddie Murphy deserves a mention in this quiz, if only for his work in the two 'Nutty Professor' films in which he plays a number of characters, including the extremely obese Professor Klump (and family).  In the 'Nutty Professor II: The Klumps', Murphy plays a total of eight roles, while in the first offering he plays seven.  In which of Murphy's other films does he play several roles (i.e. more than two)?  ", "correct": "Coming to America", "options": ["Boomerang", "Dr. Doolittle", "Harlem Nights"], "explanation": "\n\n\nComing to America.\n\n\tIn the 1988 film 'Coming to America', Murphy plays Prince Akeem, Randy Watson, Clarence the barber and Saul, an old Jewish man.  The make-up and prosthetic suits that Murphy has worn for these films certainly entitle him to a place in this quiz.  In fact, I wonder where the heck his Academy Award nominations have been...who else could play 8 roles in one film?  Incidentally, Arsenio Hall also played 4 roles in 'Coming to America', bringing the total to 8 for the two actors! \n"}, {"text": "This one actor is so multi-faceted, he has played a composer who goes deaf, a Russian hijacker, a crazed caucasian pimp who thinks he's black, a shifty but sophisticated vampire, a drugged-up English punk rocker, the most notorious assassin in American history, among many other varied roles.  Only one actor could possibly be this multi-talented, but which of these is it?", "correct": "Gary Oldman", "options": ["Harvey Keitel", "Bill Paxton", "Samuel Jackson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Oldman.\n\n\tOldman played Beethoven in 'Immortal Beloved', the Russian hijacker Egor Korshunov in 'Air Force One', Drexl Spivey the insane pimp in 'True Romance', Count Dracula in the 1992 version of 'Dracula', Sid Vicious of Sex Pistols fame in 'Sid and Nancy', and Lee Harvey Oswald in 'JFK' (sorry if you were thinking Booth!)  Try watching a couple of these films back to back, it's hard to believe that the same guy performed these roles!  Oldman, an Englishman, likes to take great care in preparing for his roles, and specializes in transforming himself both physically and linguistically. I can imagine he has an easy time making himself inconspicuous in public places. \n"}, {"text": "Actor F. Murray Abraham, who won a much deserved Best Actor Oscar for the film 'Amadeus', spent five hours a day in make-up in order to appear as an old man for certain scenes in the film.  In addition, he spent most of the time during the filming of 'Amadeus' in isolation in order to acclimate himself to the sequestered and aloof lifestyle of the character he portrayed.  Five weeks of this isolation and heavy make-up work culminated in his magnificent performance as which character, and real-life individual, in Mozart's life?", "correct": "Antonio Salieri", "options": ["Count Orsini-Rosenberg", "Emanuel Schikaneder", "Emperor Joseph II"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAntonio Salieri.\n\n\tPoor Salieri...and poor Mr. Abraham!  According to both Tom Hulce and Abraham, the originally unintentional isolation of F. Murray Abraham from the rest of the cast created something of a rift among the cast.  It seems that poor Abraham remained aloof from the cast, originally through necessity as he filmed his isolated scenes, but later purposefully as his immersion into the role became greater. While the rest of the cast attended parties together, Abraham was uninvited.  Despite this somewhat artificial gulf, the chief actors in the film have expressed great admiration for each other's work, and consider themselves respected associates. \n"}, {"text": "Several actors for the film 'The Matrix' went through a rigorous physical training regimen prior to the beginning of filming.  This training included the learning of numerous martial arts techniques.  Actors Keanu Reeves, Larry Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all received this training, as did the lead actress in the film, who played the part of Trinity.  Additionally, showing her dedication, this actress, despite spraining her ankle during the filming of a fight scene, continued to film until the movie was completed.  Which of these actresses played the key role of Trinity in 'The Matrix'?", "correct": "Carrie-Anne Moss", "options": ["Lucy Liu", "Theresa Russell", "Wynona Rider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss.\n\n\tApparently, Miss Moss kept her ankle sprain a secret while filming went on with the movie.  At the time she was a relatively unknown actress and feared that she would be replaced, much as actress Elizabeth Berridge substituted for an injured Meg Tilly in the film 'Amadeus' as Constanze (Tilly had also sprained her ankle, just prior to filming.) \n"}, {"text": "A very deserving mention should be made of the most recognized Klingon in television and movie history, Worf.  One actor has played this widely loved 'Star Trek' character during 12 years of television programming and several films.  This fact, in itself, may not seem exceptional, but consider...for every filming he does as Worf he is required to go through several hours of make-up work.  Add to this the fact that he is the 'Star Trek' character who has appeared in the most combined film and television episodes, and you get the picture.  Who is the very dedicated actor behind Mr. Worf? ", "correct": "Michael Dorn", "options": ["Lavar Burton", "Brent Spiner", "Jonathan Frakes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMichael Dorn.\n\n\tThough Worf is the most frequently appearing character within the 'Star Trek' universe (and my personal favorite, I might add), in interviews he has insisted that he doesn't mind the rigorous make-up process.  For that reason, his place in this quiz is surely deserved! \n"}, {"text": "Robert De Niro is known as one of the most dedicated actors in the business.  An exemplary example of his work may be found in the 1980 film 'Raging Bull'.  In preparation for this film, De Niro trained in a real boxing school and actually fought in several genuine matches, winning a couple of them!  During the filming, in order to simulate the lead character in his later years, De Niro gained 50 pounds.  What was the name of the title character, played by Mr. De Niro, in this film?", "correct": "Jake La Motta", "options": ["Gerry Cooney", "Tony Graziano", "Rocky Marziano"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJake La Motta.\n\n\tDe Niro is a very dedicated actor.  According to an interview I watched he often spends up to two months prior to the filming of a movie just to prepare for the role he will play.  This preparation frequently takes the guise of exercise and physical training, occupational instruction and psychological immersion. For the film 'Midnight Run', as an example, De Niro shadowed some real bounty hunters, while for 'Taxi Driver' he actually worked as a cab driver for a month!  Ironically, though De Niro went through such extensive physical rigours for 'Raging Bull', it was his co-star Joe Pesci who suffered the worst injury, a broken rib delivered by an accidental punch by De Niro...oops! \n"}, {"text": "The lead actor in the film 'A Clockwork Orange' went through very difficult times while performing his role as Alex Delarge.  Performing his own stunts, he was placed into a strait jacket with his eyelids forced open by a strange apparatus in one scene.  In another scene his head was forced underwater for over a minute, with only a breathing apparatus protecting him from potential drowning.  In addition, he wore a full body cast, licked the bottom of a man's shoe and fell into a plate of spaghetti.  Who played the lead role in this warped but marvelous film?", "correct": "Malcolm McDowell", "options": ["Peter Sellers", "Alec Guiness", "Peter O'Toole"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMalcolm McDowell.\n\n\tMcDowell was actually injured several times while performing in his role for 'A Clockwork Orange'.  The apparatus that pulled his eyelids back made a scratch in his cornea, causing momentary blindness (from which he fully recovered).  While performing the scene in which he was submerged in the water, McDowell's breathing equipment malfunctioned, a very harrowing experience indeed!  If this isn't enough, in one scene where he was punched inadvertently by another actor he suffered a broken rib.  Hmm...how delightful!  I wonder which tasted better...the spaghetti or the bottom of that shoe? \n"}, {"text": "A fun one to finish up.  In his most recognized role, actor Paul Reubens was forced to wear a grey suit that was surely 2 sizes too small and a hairstyle that was painful to behold.  To make matters worse, in various scenes he is forced to ride a bull, wear a hairnet and don three inch platform shoes while performing a harrowing dance in a biker bar!  To top it off, Reubens suffers the humiliation of wearing a red bowtie during the entire film!  Please name this zany character played by Mr. Reubens.", "correct": "Pee Wee & Pee Wee Herman & Herman & Pee Wee & Peewee & Peewee Herman & Pee-wee & Pee-Wee Herman", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPee Wee & Pee Wee Herman & Herman & Pee Wee & Peewee & Peewee Herman & Pee-wee & Pee-Wee Herman.\n\n\tSomehow, I suspect that Mr. Reubens did not suffer entirely too much while playing this role.  In fact, it is likely that he put himself into the role...it wasn't much of a stretch.  Potentially the most magnificent stunts in the film, which involve Pee Wee riding a bicycle, were unfortunately not performed by Mr. Reubens himself...but rather by his stunt double!  Thank you for playing this quiz, I hope that you enjoyed and were entertained... \n"}]}
