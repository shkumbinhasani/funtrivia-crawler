She's there getting a haircut to better prepare to be a social media influencer, and she discusses as much with her hairdresser.  The appointment is interrupted though. As a crowd forms outside, all of the salon's patrons and staff receive alerts on their phones-- it's an urgent alert and it states that there's a ballistic missile threat inbound to the city.  It is not a drill.  Coco says that it's likely a hoax, but that's when she gets a video call from her father in Hong Kong. He tells her that the missiles are real.  It's too late for him and her family, but he has four seats reserved for her on a private flight leaving from Santa Monica Airport.  She has less than an hour.  The call cuts off abruptly. \n"}, {"text": "How many people depart on Coco's plane leaving Santa Monica Airport?", "correct": "Four & 4", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour & 4.\n\n\tCoco calls Brock, her husband, while she and Mallory are driven to Santa Monica Airport, and demands he meet them there.  At the same time, news is released-- Hong Kong, London, Moscow, and other locations have been destroyed by intercontinental ballistic missiles.  TVs go off the air and air raid sirens are sounded soon after.\rCoco's hairdresser heads home to collect his grandmother, Evie, who believes it's likely nothing more than fake news.  Nonetheless, they both make it to Santa Monica Airport to intercept Coco and Mallory and take the remaining seats on the plane amidst all the chaos.\rThey do manage to take off though.  When Mallory checks the cockpit, it turns out that the plane is flying on autopilot.  None of them know where they're headed.\rBut they are headed away.  An explosion rocks the plane and it rights itself, and when the passengers look out the window, a mushroom cloud rises from where Los Angeles used to be. \n"}, {"text": "Officials from The Cooperative inform Timothy that they received his genetic information from which of these?", "correct": "An ancestry website", "options": ["His doctor", "His university application", "In-school medical tests"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn ancestry website.\n\n\tForty minutes before the bomb, a family celebrates as their eldest son gets into UCLA.  Of course, moments later, the phone alert sounds.  After they watch the news on TV in disbelief, there's a knock on their door and two people in suits arrive specifically for Timothy Campbell, the eldest son, asserting that he has the ideal genetic make-up and has been selected by The Cooperative to be placed into safe keeping during the coming disaster.  They are only there for him.\rThey bring him underground in cuffs and lock him into a chain-link cell somewhere.  Above him, a girl named Emily tells him that she befell the same sort of treatment.  Somewhere, an explosion rocks their cells and the emergency lights turn on. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Outposts do Timothy and Emily join?", "correct": "Outpost Three", "options": ["Outpost Black", "Outpost Alpha", "Outpost Z"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOutpost Three.\n\n\tTwo weeks after the bombs drop, Timothy and Emily are brought through the fallout zone to an outpost equipped for long-term habitation; there are nine others around the world, all funded by The Collective and containing others like them (and those who could afford it).  They're told to put on hazmat suits before they're dropped off, alone, and let into the iron gates of their new home. They're met there by a figure in a large, black hazmat suit who leads them, mysteriously, through the fog and past an execution.  Finally, they're brought through the main door of their new home, led inside, and brought down an elevator. After decontamination, their suits are removed and a woman meets them holding a candle in one hand and a cane in the other.  She introduces herself as Wilhelmina Venable, and tells them that they are in Outpost Three. \n"}, {"text": "How many visionaries make up The Cooperative, according to Ms. Venable?", "correct": "Twelve", "options": ["Five", "Ten", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwelve.\n\n\tMs. Venable brings Timothy and Emily through Outpost Three, stating that the lavish underground bunker they're in was once a boy's school, but The Cooperative purchased it and made it into what it is now.  The Cooperative is made up of a dozen minds, The Visionaries, who saw the fires of the bomb as the beginning long before they were dropped. As 'purples', Venable states, Timothy and Emily will receive their own private rooms as they are elite and worthy, those chosen to survive.  They share Outpost Three with the 'greys', their workers, who are fortunate to be there or, else, they would face nuclear winter. Ms. Venable claims to be neither purple nor grey as she is the strong, right arm of The Cooperative. \n"}, {"text": "Ms. Venable states that neither Timothy nor Emily shall be allowed to leave the compound under any circumstances.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tEmily gives Ms. Venable sass before she departs and is then forced to hear the rules of Outpost Three, most of which sums up to the fact that no one is allowed to leave the compound due to the risk of radioactive contamination.  If they leave, they will need to take their chances out with the cankerpus monsters beyond the gates.  Additionally, there is no allowance of unauthorized copulation.  That was why the two greys were executed as they entered the compound.  They're invited for cocktails in the music room before dinner before Ms. Venable departs.\rAfter Timothy takes a shower, he sees that someone has written '666' on his mirror in the fog. \n"}, {"text": "Regular dinner in the outpost consists of which of these?", "correct": "A gelatinous cube", "options": ["A pill", "Roast beef and vegetables", "A protein shake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gelatinous cube.\n\n\tTimothy and Emily dress and prepare for their first evening with their fellow Outpost Three residents, and when they enter they find a group of about seven others already inside complaining about all manner of things-- the music, the mineral water, their social standing.  Timothy recognizes Dinah Stevens amongst them; she was on television before the bomb dropped.  Ms. Venable enters and rings a bell to announce that dinner is served, and they all head to the dining room.  Timothy and Emily discover that dinner is no more than a single cube containing all of the vitamins their bodies need in a day.  Or so they say.\rCoco, frustrated with her constant hunger, decides to vent about the whole situation as Ms. Venable enters and slaps her in the face.  She is frank about their situation-- they had a perimeter alert earlier in the morning.  Something penetrated the grounds.  It was a carrier pigeon containing words from their benefactors.  It read: 'There are no more governments, only corpses.  Too many to bury.  Starving people kill for a piece of bread  Three outposts have been overrun.  We are the last vestiges of civilized life on the planet.  Be vigilant.'  It only took two weeks. \n"}, {"text": "Who is found to be contaminated with radiation and forced into decontamination?", "correct": "Mr. Gallant", "options": ["Andre", "Coco", "Timothy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. Gallant\n\n\tMs. Venable and her associate, Ms. Mead, are alerted at dinner to the fact that there is a spike in contamination somewhere in the dining hall, and all diners are forced to undergo a check with a geiger counter.  It's discovered, there, that two of them-- Mr. Gallant and Stu-- exhibit high levels of radioactivity and both of them are forced into decontamination, a horribly painful process overseen by Ms. Mead.  She has both of them hosed down and tested again, but Stu continues to test positive.  She puts a bullet in his head to solve the issue. \n"}, {"text": "For a special occasion, Ms. Venable serves the occupants of the outpost which of these meats?", "correct": "Human", "options": ["Pork", "Pigeon", "Cockroach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuman.\n\n\tWhile trying on a grey dress, Ms. Venable is met in her room by Ms. Mead who, taking off her jacket, reveals her own purple dress.  The two of them giggle over their impropriety and enjoy the evening together, playing cards by the fire.  Mead admits to her that she framed Stu, cranking the geiger counter's sensitivity to make it seem like he was beyond saving.  Venable states that she loves doling out punishments and the two of them clink glasses in celebration.  Mead is unsure about what they're doing, but Venable assures her that they make the rules now; the Cooperative won't bother them anymore.\rOut in the dining room the following night, Stu is mourned by some of the residents and criticized by others.  All are surprised, however, when dinner is not their gelatinous cubes, but rich and hearty meat stew.  Many are shocked, however, when they find that the stew actually is Stu.\rIn the music room that night, Andre decries the others for eating Stu, but they all reason that Venable wouldn't serve them (and herself) irradiated meat.  All of them are caught offguard when the song on the music box, which has not changed for two weeks, is changed to \"The Morning After\" by Maureen McGovern.  The believe this to be a sign and that they shall be saved. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Langdon arrives at the outpost on which of these?", "correct": "Horse-drawn carriage", "options": ["Segway", "Motorcycle", "Train"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorse-drawn carriage.\n\n\tEighteen months after the Stu dinner, the inhabitants of Outpost Three continue to use the music room.  No one came for them.  Nuclear winter killed off nearly everything outside the compound and the world got deadlier.  Even then, Timothy and Emily find love with each other, even if they have to hide it.  At the eighteen month mark, the gelatinous cube ration is also cut back severely. Ms. Venable announces that they will no longer be eating breakfast.  Mr. Gallant begins to make a scene, but the alarms sound within the compound; there's been a breach.  Ms. Mead goes to check with her followers and outside, a horse-drawn carriage pulls up to the outpost. The man at the reins shows his Cooperative Identification Document bearing the name Michael Langdon, and says he has arrived to speak to Ms. Venable.  While Ms. Mead kills the horses, tossing them over a cliff to be dragged into the bushes by whatever's out in the fallout, Michael states that all of the outposts will be overrun in due time, but he's there to evaluate Outpost Three's residents and, if they are worthy, bring them to a sanctuary where there are enough supplies to keep them safe for a decade.  He can bring them all or none of them.  But he will see. \n"}]}
