{"id": "383742", "name": "\"Van Helsing\" - The Pilot Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television U-Z", "V"], "questions": [{"text": "In what year was the show set?", "correct": "2019", "options": ["3212", "1899", "1643"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2019.\n\n\tSet just three years from when the show debuted on television, yet so many things were already vastly different. Vanessa (Van) Helsing had died years earlier, but was still in the morgue. The first time she was shown in the pilot she was laying on a table, presumably still dead when vampires tried to turn her. The vampire that bit her got sick off the blood, and she awoke and killed the rest. \n"}, {"text": "What restaurant did Axel say he missed going to? ", "correct": "Subway", "options": ["McDonald's", "Steak and Shake", "Carl's Junior"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSubway.\n\n\tHe was sitting outside of a cage talking to a vampire who was drinking his blood through a plastic tube. He said he missed the little things, like going to Subway for double meat on his subs or Kit Kat candy bars. \n"}, {"text": "Which character was a United States Marine? ", "correct": "Axel", "options": ["Vanessa", "Sam", "John "], "explanation": "\n\n\nAxel.\n\n\tHe was tasked with protecting the facility where Vanessa Helsing's body, and a vampire known as \"The Doc\" were kept. The building was an abandoned hospital in Seattle. \n"}, {"text": "Vampires were able to walk in daylight in the pilot. ", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tDuring the first attack on the hospital many of the vampires, wearing a layer of clothes to cover, were running around and attacking during the daylight. When they were exposed to sunlight, they seemed to be hurt, but not majorly damaged by the light. UV lights at the hospital had a more severe impact on them. A volcano eruption was thought to be the cause of why vampires were able to walk in the sunlight. \n"}, {"text": "How were the dead vampires disposed of in the hospital?", "correct": "Tossed into a garbage chute", "options": ["Left to lay in the halls", "Burned as a heat source", "Tossed into a garbage chute ", "Dismembered and thrown out windows"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTossed into a garbage chute.\n\n\tThey dragged the bodies down the hall to the hospital loading docks and then tossed them into a garbage chute. Opening the garbage chute caused everyone to complain about the smell. Apparently in a post-apocalyptic world, no one empties the trash bins. \n"}, {"text": "Which character was deaf?", "correct": "Sam", "options": ["Vanessa", "John", "Axel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam.\n\n\tAxel was yelling at him when he first got to the hospital compound, only to find out he was deaf. There were several scenes later that showed him using sign language. Sam was played by Christopher Heyerdahl. \n"}, {"text": "Who walked in on Vanessa in the shower?", "correct": "Axel", "options": ["Nicole", "John", "Sam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAxel.\n\n\tHe walked into the shower while she was washing the blood off of her from the attack. He told her that they didn't have a lot of water and had to double up on showers. She tried to cover up, but he told her that he had been taking care of her for three years and was \"over\" her. \n"}, {"text": "Vanessa had a superhuman healing factor.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tShe was stabbed through the left hand during a fight on the hospital roof. After stabbing her attacker with the knife (that was still stuck in her hand) she ripped it out and her hand healed immediately. \n"}, {"text": "What happened to the vampire who bit Vanessa?", "correct": "He turned human again", "options": ["He dropped dead immediately", "He started to rage and kill other vampires", "Nothing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe turned human again.\n\n\tInitially thought to be dead, he was tossed out with the other bodies. Near the end of the episode he climbed back out of the garbage chute, covered in blood. After the others in the hospital found him, he proclaimed to be human again. He said that ever since he bit her he could feel again. \n"}, {"text": "Where in the U.S. is the show set?", "correct": "Pacific Northwest", "options": ["South", "East Coast", "Midwest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPacific Northwest.\n\n\tThe hospital where most of the pilot is set was in Seattle. The sign showing the hospital was in Seattle could be seen in the scene when the returning marine and new survivors came back to join Axel, The doctor and Vanessa. No other mention of the setting was given in the pilot, but in the following episodes it was made clear that the show was mostly in and around the state of Washington. \n"}]}
