{"id": "371400", "name": "Books I Wish to Read Quiz | Mixed Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Mixed Literature", "Authors and their Works"], "questions": [{"text": "One of the series I wish to read features Lucas Davenport. The \"Prey\" series, which began in 1989 with \"Rules of Prey\", was written by which of these authors?", "correct": "Sandford, John", "options": ["Child, Lincoln", "Koontz, Dean", "Grisham, John"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSandford, John.\n\n\tJohn Sandford began writing the Prey series in 1989. In 2015, the 25th in the series, \"Gathering Prey\", was released. The series follows a police detective from Minnesota named Lucas Davenport. If you are interested in murder and crime novels, I suggest you add this series to your reading list as well. \n"}, {"text": "Scott Westerfeld has written many books, but one particular series of his stands out. My sister has read the four books below, which happen to be from the same series. If I were to start reading this science fiction series as well, which would be the one I would choose first (in other words, which is first in the series)?", "correct": "Uglies", "options": ["Extras", "Pretties", "Specials"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUglies.\n\n\tScott Westerfeld wrote the \"Uglies\" series from 2005-2007. It began with \"Uglies\" in 2005, and it was followed by \"Pretties\", \"Specials\", and finally with \"Extras\". The story follows Tally Youngblood who rebels against a world where everyone becomes \"pretty\" at 16 due to cosmetic surgery. I won't tell you any more about the book, because I wish to read the series and don't want to spoil anything for myself either. \n"}, {"text": "The \"In Death\" series is one that has always interested me, but with 50 books written within a 20 year span (and more to come), it was always difficult for me to decide to start it. The authors listed below are, oddly enough, all the same person; but under which pseudonym did she write the \"In Death\" series?", "correct": "Robb, J.D.", "options": ["March, Jill", "Roberts, Nora", "Hardesty, Sarah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobb, J.D.\n\n\tEleanor Robertson has written dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of books in her lifetime. However, not all of these books have been written using the same name. For the \"In Death\" series, Nora Roberts decided to use the pseudonym of J. D. Robb. \"In Death\" follows the New York City Police and Security Department lieutenant Eve Dallas (as well as her husband Roarke) as they solve murders and do other police work.In 2014, the 49th novel was published, and at the time, Roberts/Robb made a famous statement that the series would continue to be written until she was tired of it, at which point it would end with Eve's pregnancy.The series would never feature one of her children, as the pregnancy would be the finale of the series. \n"}, {"text": "James Patterson has written so many best-selling books, it is hard to keep track of them. One of his best known series is the one featuring Alex Cross. Which of these is not a title of one of the books in that particular series?", "correct": "Run for Your Life", "options": ["Pop Goes the Weasel", "Violets Are Blue", "Along Came a Spider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRun for Your Life.\n\n\t\"Run For Your Life\", though a Patterson novel, is not one from the \"Alex Cross\" series. \"Along Came a Spider\" was the first book in the very successful series, and it was published in 1993. The book was also adapted into a film starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. The series has continued; the 20th novel was released in 2013. Interestingly, nearly every single one of the novels in this series has made it to the bestsellers' list. \n"}, {"text": "The \"Inheritance Cycle\" was written by a young author named Christopher Paolini, and is a must for any science fiction lover. The dragon-filled series began with which of these novels?", "correct": "Eragon", "options": ["Brisingr", "Eldest", "Inheritance"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEragon.\n\n\t\"Eragon\" was first published in 2002 by Paolini's parent's publishing company, and in 2003 it was republished by another company. Interestingly enough, Paolini was only 18 when his novel was first published, and he had started writing it when he graduated from high school at 15. Now, as I was researching the novel to write this without giving myself any spoilers, I discovered something that I had never known before; Eragon isn't actually the name of the dragon. Eragon is a farm boy, and his dragon is named Saphira. \n"}, {"text": "Sue Grafton is best known for her alphabet series starring Kinsey Millhone, and, naturally, the series can be easily identified and ordered based on the letters of the alphabet. Which of these novels does not belong with her alphabet series?", "correct": "N is for Napalm", "options": ["U is for Undertow", "R is for Ricochet", "L is for Lawless"], "explanation": "\n\n\nN is for Napalm.\n\n\tIn 1998, Sue Grafton released her \"N\" novel (the fourteenth in the series), but it was actually entitled \"N is for Noose\". The mystery series began in 1982 with the release of \"A is for Alibi\". At the time in the series, Kinsey Millhone was 32; she was 38 when \"V is for Vengeance\" was released in 2011. I found this aging interesting because she was, according to the novels, born in 1950, which does indeed place her age to 32 when the first novel was released.However, though the first novel was in \"real time\", Kinsey Millhone apparently lived a lot slower than the rest of us, because 19 years later, only six years had passed. \n"}, {"text": "\"The People of Ember\" was once a book I was supposed to read for school, and I was very excited. However, I was transferred to a new school and never actually got to read it. Since then, three more novels have been included in the series. Which of these authors is responsible for the books?", "correct": "DuPrau, Jeanne", "options": ["DiCamillo, Kate", "Evanovich, Janet", "Deveraux, Jude"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuPrau, Jeanne.\n\n\tJeanne DuPrau released the first novel in the \"City of Ember\" series in 2003; it was simply called \"The City of Ember\". The second book was \"The People of Sparks\", and this was followed by \"The Prophet of Yonwood\". The 2008 novel \"The Diamond of Darkhold\" concluded the series. As I am a fan of post-apocalyptic literature, this is a series that interests me. \"The City of Ember\" is about an underground city that is running out of power and supplies. The main characters in the book find and decode clues to lead them out of the city - clues left by the original builders of the underground world. \n"}, {"text": "Robert Ludlum began the Bourne series in 1980 (the three novels he wrote all became very successful films), but when he passed away, Eric Van Lustbader took over the series. Which of these is not a word that is used to fill in the blank: \"The Bourne _____\"?", "correct": "Espionage", "options": ["Deception", "Dominion", "Betrayal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEspionage.\n\n\t\"The Bourne Identity\" was published by Robert Ludlum in 1980, and it was the first in the original trilogy featuring Jason Bourne. It was also adapted into a film starring Matt Damon, who also portrayed Jason Bourne in the two sequels also based on Ludlum's original trilogy (\"The Bourne Supremacy\" and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\"). In 2004, Eric Van Lustbader took over the series when he released \"The Bourne Legacy\". Jeremy Renner starred in the film adaptation, though the movie barely followed the book, not even centering itself on Jason Bourne (it, essentially, just used the name of the novel for the film). \n"}, {"text": "Nicholas Sparks has written several books that I do enjoy, but I haven't read all of his. Of all of these books (none of which I have read), which one was not adapted into a film?", "correct": "Rescue, The", "options": ["Notebook, The", "Lucky One, The", "Best of Me, The"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRescue, The.\n\n\t\"The Rescue\" was released in 2000, and debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Sellers list (it reached the top position the very next week). Though the book met with such success, it was not adapted into a film. \"The Notebook\", \"The Best of Me\", and \"The Lucky One\", however, were all adapted into films. \n"}, {"text": "Sonya Hartnett released a very intriguing novel about a dying man named Gabriel, who narrates the book as a look back on his short life. In order to get the title of the book, you may want to look back at the first nine questions. The first letter of each answer, in order, spells out the title of the novel. What is it?", "correct": "Surrender", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSurrender.\n\n\t\"Surrender\" was released in 2005 by Sonya Hartnett. The story is narrated by Gabriel, a twenty-year-old man who is dying, and also by his only friend, a homeless boy named Finnigan. In the novel, Gabriel looks back on his short life, but when arson attacks begin, he realizing how dangerous Finnigan is, and, according to the author's summary, 'only the most extreme measures will rid Gabriel of him for good'.\r Gabriel's only other friend is his dog, Surrender, which, as I have yet to read this book, I can only assume is the namesake of the novel. \n"}]}
