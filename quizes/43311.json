{"id": "43311", "name": "The Battle of 'Schindler's List' Online Trivia | Movies | 5 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies Q-T", "Schindler's List"], "questions": [{"text": "Much criticism of 'Schindler's List' centers around respect for victims of the Holocaust. Why are documentaries like 'Shoah' and 'Night and Fog' considered acceptable by this rule, while 'Schindler's List' is not?", "correct": "'Schindler's List' was a fictionalization", "options": ["'Schindler's List' had no narration to counteract Nazi declarations", "'Schindler's List' used shoddier camerawork", "Spielberg's credentials were less impressive than the other directors'"], "explanation": "\n\n\n'Schindler's List' was a fictionalization.\n\n\tSpielberg was accused of trying to represent the unimaginable. The idea of having actors portray Holocaust victims in a movie designed to play to the masses strikes many as disrespectful. Many, however, argue that the cultural elitism of the documentary purists has allowed deniers of the Holocaust to gain ground. \n"}, {"text": "Many object to the perspective from which the story was told. Whose perspective is that?", "correct": "of Nazis: Schindler and Goeth", "options": ["of collaborators: Schindler and Stern", "of children: Adam and Katya", "of stereotyped Jews: Stern and Mrs. Resner"], "explanation": "\n\n\nof Nazis: Schindler and Goeth.\n\n\tWhile there are scenes that focus on all these characters, the movie as a whole is told from the perspectives of Schindler and Goeth, both members of the Nazi Party. Portraying the Holocaust through the eyes of its perpetrators, rather than focusing solely on its victims, rankles many people. There are also complaints that the Jews are stereotyped and that Stern in particular is painted as a weak, emasculated character compared to the German Schindler.There is, however, no consensus: many argue that the Jewish characters are differentiated and well-drawn, and that anyone who argues that Stern is weak-willed has not seen the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Another influential argument is that the movie presents a skewed view of the Holocaust, in that:", "correct": "all the main characters survive the Holocaust", "options": ["there are some good Gentiles", "no movie can accurately portray such horror", "the actors are too healthy-looking to be Holocaust victims"], "explanation": "\n\n\nall the main characters survive the Holocaust.\n\n\tAlthough there has been criticism of the health of the actors and the fact that 'Schindler's List' is a movie, the main criticism here is that all the main characters survive. As a movie about survivors in a time when so many millions died, 'Schindler's List' dangerously depicts the Holocaust as less horrific than it actually was.However, a few major characters -- such as the elderly one-armed man and the boy who works for Goeth -- do die in the film, and most viewers find that the quantity of atrocity scenes obviously indicate that Schindler's Jews were the exception and not the rule of the Holocaust. \n"}, {"text": "Spielberg's directing and cinematography are also often dismissed as 'gimmicky.' According to analyst Miriam Braatu Hansen, which of the following 'gimmicks' created the most moral (not artistic) outrage among his critics?", "correct": "the shower scene at Auschwitz, in which characters believe they are about to be gassed", "options": ["frequent shots of Schindler's mistresses", "the girl in the red dress", "classical music during the liquidation of the ghetto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe shower scene at Auschwitz, in which characters believe they are about to be gassed.\n\n\tWhile auteurs criticized the girl in the red dress (the rest of the movie was black-and-white) on artistic grounds, and while there were objections to the graphic violence, no scene sparked as much controversy as the shower scene, when the camera follows several dozen women into the showers at Auschwitz, where they believe they are about to be gassed but only water comes out of the faucets. Even some of Spielberg's supporters said that when the camera crossed that threshold, the movie for the moment crossed the line between social commentary and sensationalism. \n"}, {"text": "Defenders of 'Schindler's List' often point to the twofold goals of Holocaust commemoration. Documentaries speak to the desire to 'never forget'; what other goal, according to some of its supporters, does 'Schindler's List' speak to?", "correct": "never again", "options": ["never give up", "never desecrate", "ever alert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnever again.\n\n\tBy telling its story from the perspective of two Nazis -- one who sacrificed everything to save Jews, and another who casually murdered them -- 'Schindler's List' forces viewers to examine what THEY would do. There is a tendency to view the Nazis as monsters of pure evil, but this is dangerous: they were humans, like us, and the things they did can and have been done again (by Pol Pot of Cambodia, for example). To view the Nazis as wholly separate, a historical fluke, is to wilfully ignore the historical lesson of the Holocaust.'Schindler's List' is not as simplistic a film as its detractors make it out to be: it addresses a facet of Holocaust remembrance too often ignored by the media today.(As you may have guessed, I'm a defender of 'Schindler.') \n"}]}
