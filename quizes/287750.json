{"id": "287750", "name": "\"Twilight Princess\" Obtainable Items Multiple Choice Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Zelda Games", "Twilight Princess"], "questions": [{"text": "How many Twilit Parasites fit into a Vessel of Light?", "correct": "Sixteen", "options": ["Seventeen", "Fifteen", "Eighteen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixteen.\n\n\tThe three Vessels of Light in the game are given to Link by the spirits of Faron, Eldin, and Lanayru, respectively, and each of them must be filled by Link in wolf form before normality can be restored in these provinces.  Although the Vessel of Light isn't bound to any buttons of the Wii Remote, it appears on the side of the player's interface to track progress. As a Twilit Parasite is captured, one of the orbs on the vessel (which looks like a bunch of grapes) will glow.  After Lanayru Province, no more of these will appear as Link will have rid the twilight from Hyrule (on that grand scale).  Link does not encounter spirits in the Peak and Desert Provinces as well. \n"}, {"text": "Some may regard this as a character, and some may regard it as an item, but which dungeon does not feature Ooccoo?", "correct": "Palace of Twilight", "options": ["City in the Sky", "Temple of Time", "Snowpeak Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalace of Twilight.\n\n\tAlthough Ooccoo and her son(?) Ooccoo Jr. are technically characters, it doesn't stop them from being placed into Link's inventory.  Link can bind these creatures to a button on the controller and use them to warp to the beginning of a dungeon.  Although these two aren't necessary in the slightest, they are kind of quirky, adding an odd element to the game. Ooccoo and Ooccoo Jr. are part of the Oocca Tribe, and Link encounters them full-force in their home, the City in the Sky.  Getting there is the hard part though.  As Link discovers, even the scatterbrained Ooccoo can't find an easy way of reaching her homeland (or homesky).  She has to wait until the Oocca Cannon is repaired by Fyer to be shot into the sky with Link. Since the Palace of Twilight follows Ooccoo's return to the City in the Sky, she does not make an appearance. \n"}, {"text": "When does Link obtain a Fused Shadow?", "correct": "After defeating Diababa", "options": ["After defeating Blizzeta", "During his journey through the Palace of Twilight", "During his quest to find the Ancient Sky Characters"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAfter defeating Diababa.\n\n\tThe three Fused Shadows of \"Twilight Princess\" are claimed as Link and Midna make their way through the Forest Temple, Goron Mines, and Lakebed Temple; the first three dungeons of the game.  As they defeat their respective bosses, these are relinquished, and Midna uses these to form her armor.  Once these three pieces are recovered, the duo will progress to the Gerudo Desert for the next portion of their quest. Although Lin does claim one piece after defeating Diabab, one is also claimed after defeating Fyrus, and after defeating Morpheel.  After exiting the Lakebed Temple, Zant will promptly destroy the armor and Link will need to take Midna to Princess Zelda in Hyrule Temple to be healed. Unfortunately, Zant realizes this and seals off the temple as they depart. \n"}, {"text": "In which dungeon does Link need to obtain three Key Shards to form the Boss Key?", "correct": "Goron Mines", "options": ["Temple of Time", "Lakebed Temple", "Arbiter's Grounds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGoron Mines.\n\n\tUnlike many other dungeons, the Boss Key required for the end of the Goron Mines is split into three pieces, each of which is held by a friendly Gorons within the dungeon.  These Gorons, Gor Amoto, Gor Ebizo, and Gor Liggs, are all found within safe rooms containing other small treasures.  Other than these three and the final boss, Fyrus, Link encounters Dangoro before claiming the Hero's Bow.  A Boss Key is required to enter the boss room door in every dungeon of the game.  It is also known as the Big Key.  Once all three are collected, the Big Key is automatically formed.\rLink also encounters another powerful Goron elder, Gor Coron, at the top of Death Mountain, and he must defeat him in a sumo duel before entering the mines. \n"}, {"text": "How many Poe Souls does Link need to obtain to free Jovani and Gengle?", "correct": "Sixty", "options": ["Twenty-five", "Fifty", "Forty"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSixty.\n\n\tLink can find Jovani and Gengle in Hyrule Castle Town within a locked house (Link accesses it in wolf form by making his way through the roof of Telma's Bar).  Once Link visits for the first time, he will learn that Gengle and Jovani aspired to be rich and had this curse placed upon them where they were transformed into jewels and rupees of all shapes and sizes. Ironically, their greed overtook them, and in order for Link to restore them to perfect health, he must collect the sixty Poe Souls from the far corners of Hyrule.  Once Gengle and Jovani are restored, Link will be able to visit once every time he comes to Hyrule Castle Town for two hundred rupees, as the duo will decide to give away all of their riches in response. \n"}, {"text": "Where can Link obtain Hot Springwater?", "correct": "Kakariko Village", "options": ["Death Mountain", "Ordon Village", "Snowpeak Ruins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKakariko Village.\n\n\tAlthough it's not a necessity, Hot Srpingwater does provide Link with an advantage if he sees it fit to be used.  In order for Link to obtain the Springwater, he must use an empty bottle in Kakariko Village's springs which overlook the main drag of town.  Once Link ingests the liquid, he'll find his hearts replenished and that he has a slight boost in terms of strength and stamina. This does wear off eventually though.  Link will also find that the Springwater will no longer be hot if kept for a prolonged period of time without being drunk.  Sadly, it will lose its healing powers, and Link will have no way to heat it back up unless he refills the bottle. Link can also purchase this drink in Hyrule Castle Town from the Goron vendor for a low price. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these scents is the final one that Link obtains?", "correct": "Medicine Scent", "options": ["Reekfish Scent", "Youth's Scent", "Ilia's Scent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMedicine Scent.\n\n\tChronologically, Link obtains the Youth's Scent, Ilia's Scent, the Reekfish Scent, and then the Medicine Scent.  As soon as Link makes his way through the Faron Wwoods in wolf form, he will discover the Youth's Scent when he finds a toy sword on the forest floor.  This will lead him to Kakariko Village after he completes the Forest Temple. Ilia's Scent will lead Link north after the Goron Mines, taking him all the way across the Bridge of Eldin and through North Hyrule Field to Hyrule Castle Town and Telma's Bar.  The Reekfish Scent is found much later when Link needs to get to Snowpeak Ruins.  The Medicine Scent is the final one that Link will obtain. Found in Doctor Borville's office, the Medicine Scent is important in getting Link to the City in the Sky.  Using the scent, Link can track down an item needed to jog Ilia's memory in Kakariko Village. \n"}, {"text": "How many shards of the Mirror of Twilight does Link obtain during the game?", "correct": "Three", "options": ["Two", "One", "Four"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree.\n\n\tMuch like the pieces of Fused Shadow that were found during the first three dungeons of the game, the Mirror of Twilight is the item to get in another trio of dungeons.  After finishing the Arbiter's Grounds, Link will arrive at the Mirror Chamber to find a shattered Mirror of Twilight, separating the daylit Hyrule from the Palace of Twilight, Midna's homeworld. After this first visit, Link and Midna must collect the other mirror shards at Snowpeak Ruins, the Temple of Time, and the City in the Sky, respectively, before they can attempt to defeat Zant at the Palace of Twilight.  When the game is complete, Midna will destroy the mirror after her re-entry as the Palace's ruler in order to maintain the peace and order that Hyrule had prior to the events of the game. \n"}, {"text": "Who gives Link the Coral Earring?", "correct": "Ralis", "options": ["Uli", "Rutela", "Ilia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRalis.\n\n\tAfter completing the Arbiter's Grounds, Link will need to make his way through Peak Province to Snowpeak Ruins, but doing this is tricky as the mountains are quite treacherous.  To find the safest route, Link will need to travel a route that was first taken by the abominable Yeto (who, as it turns out, is actually quite friendly), but to find the route, he must obtain the Reekfish Scent. The Reekfish is a vibrant fish found in the waters of Zora's Domain, but in order to catch this, Link must obtain the Coral Earring from Prince Ralis in Kakariko Village (he's in the tomb of the Zora King) and use it as a hook to reel in the fish. Although the scent doesn't take Link directly to the dungeon, Yeto will.  He's at the top of Snowpeak Mountain, and at the end of the Reekfish path. \n"}, {"text": "If Link were to give Yeto the Ordon Goat Cheese and the Ordon Pumpkin, what could he receive in return?", "correct": "Superb Soup", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSuperb Soup.\n\n\tIn Snowpeak Ruins, Link can fill any empty bottles with satisfying soup that Yeto is making for his ill wife, Yeta.  Initially, he starts with a Simple Soup which will restore two hearts on Link's health bar.  If Link finds the Ordon Pumpkin, he can relinquish it to receive the Good Soup in return.  Finding the Ordon Goat Cheese will result in Superb Soup- the final concoction. These refill four and eight hearts respectively.  These soups can be quite beneficial.  Throughout the entire fifth dungeon, Link will not be able to find a single heart to refill the health bar.  This is due to the fact that a Twilit Parasite has infected Yeta and caused her to repress her love for her husband. Once the boss is defeated, the love returns, and the hearts will as well. \n"}, {"text": "In which dungeon does Link require the Bedroom Key?", "correct": "Snowpeak Ruins", "options": ["City in the Sky", "None of these; Link uses it outside of a dungeon", "Palace of Twilight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSnowpeak Ruins.\n\n\tThe Bedroom Key, excluding the Ball and Chain, is the aim of the Snowpeak Ruins.  In order to access the boss room and the Mirror of Twilight, Link must search the dungeon for this item.  He can find it within an icy chapel.  The Bedroom Key acts as the Boss Key, and when Link returns to the courtyard with it, he will be approached by Blizzeta, who has left her easy chair in front of the fireplace in the Ruins. When she and Link enter the large bedroom, she will reveal that she is the stage's boss, Blizzeta, as she has been attacked by a Twilit Parasite.  Using the Ball and Chain, Link can easily prevent her from winning the battle. \n"}, {"text": "Which wallet holds 999 rupees?", "correct": "Giant's Wallet", "options": ["None of them", "Starter Wallet", "Big Wallet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGiant's Wallet.\n\n\tTechnically, the Giant's Wallet can hold up to 1,000 rupees, but it can hold any less as well.  The Starter Wallet holds up to 100 rupees and the Big Wallet folds 600 at the most.  Although Link begins the game with a wallet, its size isn't increased until he reaches Hyrule Castle Town.  Confusingly, Link's collection of wallets is added to when he runs into Agitha, the local 'Princess of Entomology' in her house. To get the Big Wallet, Link must give this young girl one bug that he finds in Hyrule.  Sounds easy, right?  Well when he wants to get his final wallet, he will need to hand over all twenty-four glittering bugs. In between these, Link will also obtain a hefty rupee reward for his donation.  These are good to use in helping Malo Mart move to Hyrule Castle Town (as it costs a fair bit of money).  In turn, Link can buy the Magic Armor. \n"}, {"text": "What does Ilia's Charm turn out to be?", "correct": "The Horse Call", "options": ["The Key to the Hidden Village", "A source of Ilia's Scent", "An Ancient Sky Character"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Horse Call.\n\n\tWhen Link uses the Wooden Statue to jog Ilia's memory, she will reveal the location of the Hidden Village that she was taken to by the Bulblin forces.  Once you save Impaz from the Bulblin Archers that have set up their post in the small town, she will give Link Ilia's Charm and she will stay to look over the village. When Link returns the charm to Ilia, it will turn into the Horse Call, which Link can use pretty much anywhere in Hyrule (excluding the Peak and Desert Provinces) to call Epona.  She will also reveal a method of returning power to Link's Dominion Rod, which was found in the previous dungeon, the Temple of Time. Link must make yet another trip to the Hidden Village, and then around Hyrule to actually use the Ancient Sky Book. \n"}, {"text": "What does Link receive after completing the Cave of Ordeals?", "correct": "The Great Fairy's Tears", "options": ["The Great Fairy's Magic", "The Great Fairy's Sword", "A trophy and a pat on the back"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Great Fairy's Tears.\n\n\tAlthough the retrieval of fairies in \"Majora's Mask\" may have resulted in a fun weapon, the Cave of Ordeals is more for prestige in this game.  After fifty floors worth of enemy battles and humble rewards, Link will receive a jar of tears from the Great Fairy herself.  These tears will give Link a complete health regeneration as well as increased speed and stamina. Of course, in order to do this, Link must have an empty bottle handy.  When Link reaches floors 10, 20, 30, and 40, he will allow fairies to spawn at the springs of Hyrule in four different locations.  Completion of the cave will also result in two more Poe Souls, possibly your final ones (of the sixty) allowing you to obtain Jovani and Gengle's riches. \n"}, {"text": "Link needs to obtain two of which item to create the Master Sword of Light?", "correct": "Sol Spheres & Sol Sphere", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSol Spheres & Sol Sphere.\n\n\tWhen Link goes through the Palace of Twilight, he will need to take two parallel paths to the left and right of the entrance.  At the end of each one, he will find a Sol Sphere, which he will need to take from its pedestal to the entrance of the palace in order to generate the power to imbue his sword with the power of light. Of course, it's never that easy.  Making the way to the spheres is tricky enough, and when Link actually takes the Sol Sphere, he will he chased through the level by Zant's Hands, which will attempt to reclaim the spheres and bring them back to the end of the dungeon.  Link can stop it once the sphere is taken by attacking though. Once this power is placed upon Link's weapon, he can head to the throne room to fight Zant. \n"}]}
