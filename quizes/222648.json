Happily, a bathtub that they have ordered arrives just in the nick of time, allowing them the heavenly possibility of cool baths.  From which company have they ordered this bathtub?", "correct": "Abercrombie and Fitch", "options": ["J.C. Pennies", "Montgomery Wards", "Sears"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAbercrombie and Fitch.\n\n\tBJ and Hawkeye claim to have waited six months for their bathtub to arrive.  It has taken so long that they have practically forgotten about this order.  The bathtub seems to be canvas, but must have some sort of rubber inner lining. \n"}, {"text": "Among the other 4077th dwellers, Charles is the first to discover Hawkeye and BJ's secret.  Which paradisical word does Charles use to describe the bathtub after seeing it?", "correct": "Xanadu", "options": ["Arcady", "Shangri-La", "Eden"], "explanation": "\n\n\nXanadu.\n\n\tSpecifically, Charles refers to the bathtub as a 'canvas Xanadu' (from Coleridge's poem 'Kubla Khan').  Charles initially plans to bribe Hawkeye and BJ silly for the use of their bathtub, but eventually resorts to blackmail.  He suggests that he'll tell the whole camp if not allowed the use of their water paradise. \n"}, {"text": "Klinger is up to his old ways.  Despite the tremendous heat, he is wearing rather warm clothing.  Which of these items does he not have adorning his lovely Lebanese form?", "correct": "Ski boots", "options": ["Fur coat", "Mink stole", "Snow cap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSki boots.\n\n\tKlinger claims that his intention is to die from dehydration or heat prostration, whichever comes first.  Naturally, Colonel Potter is skeptical.  More importantly, both Radar and the Colonel are annoyed by the tremendous smell eminating from their hirsute friend (and his furry get-up). \n"}, {"text": "After the three Swamp dwellers, the next person to actually see the bathtub is none other than Colonel Potter.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tActually, it is Father Mulcahy who is somehow able to sniff out the bathtub.  It's actually surprising that the entire camp isn't aware of the bathtub, considering the noise Hawkeye makes while bathing.  Not only does he sing 'Anchor's Away' and 'Hawkeye, the Sailor Man' very loudly, he also continuously squeezes his very noisy rubber ducky. \n"}, {"text": "What does Margaret exclaim after she becomes privy to the existence of the bathtub?", "correct": "I want it!", "options": ["I haven't had a bath in two years!", "Oh, beautiful bathtub!", "I've got the next dip!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI want it!.\n\n\tMargaret is actually quite amusing when she first sees the bath, shouting 'I want it!' in rather risible fashion.  Margaret claims that she will have a bubble bath, which seems to go against logic considering that a bubble bath would only be useful in a hot bath, would it not? \n"}, {"text": "Klinger ups the ante in his latest attempt to achieve a Section Eight.

Klinger requests that Radar reserve Toledo Mudhen tickets for him. \n"}, {"text": "Which 4077th dweller is unfortunately having a bath when the entire camp becomes aware of the bathtub?", "correct": "Radar", "options": ["Margaret", "Klinger", "Hawkeye"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar.\n\n\tRadar has come down with tonsillitis, and Hawkeye suggests that the young man try a cool bath.  Not surprisingly, Radar already is aware of the bathtub, having signed the shipping order for the item.  Radar is somewhat resistant to the idea of taking a bath because he is afraid to remove his clothes, but Hawkeye promises that it will be okay.  Naturally, as soon as Radar gets in the buff and jumps into the tub, half the people in the camp enter the room and marvel over the sight of the bathtub. \n"}, {"text": "Radar's is suffering from swollen tonsils, and Hawkeye and BJ eventually decide that they must come out.

Rhoden actually offers the scotch, which Hawk and Beej happily accept.  Hawkeye requests the can of Spam as Rhoden drives away, making light of the fact that the disappointed Rhoden claims that he formerly could have 'talked them down to a can of Spam'. \n"}, {"text": "Before the bathtub is carted away, the denizens of the 4077th have one last chance to enjoy watery bliss.  For which individual is this halcyonic moment defiled when Klinger, having given up in his quest for a Section Eight, dives into the tub?", "correct": "Margaret", "options": ["Charles", "Father Mulcahy", "Radar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMargaret.\n\n\tNaturally, Klinger is unable to last the full 24-hour period in his rubber reducing suit.  Stripping himself of his fur, he makes a dash for the bathtub, which unfortunately still has Margaret in it.
