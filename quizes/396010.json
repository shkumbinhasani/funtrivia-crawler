{"id": "396010", "name": "Several 'V' Destinations Quiz | Geography | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Geography Trivia", "Alphabetical Places"], "questions": [{"text": "Salzburg and Innsbruck just aren't good options for your quick trip, but you can always visit which of these major destinations, their nation's capital, as a fix?", "correct": "Vienna", "options": ["Vilnius", "Vaduz", "Valletta"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVienna.\n\n\tVienna, the capital of Austria, is in the eastern reaches of the nation on the edge of the Danube River near the borders of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  While Salzburg and Innsbruck are in the more mountainous western regions near the German and Swiss borders, they provide a bit of a different look at the German-speaking nation; Vienna is much more cosmopolitan and acts as home to a number of unique sites from sprawling palaces to medieval cathedrals.  Vienna, for many years, has been known for its high quality of living. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these 'V' destinations, if you're looking into capital cities, rests on the Mekong River?", "correct": "Vientiane", "options": ["Vinh", "Varamin", "Valenzuela"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVientiane.\n\n\tVinh, while close as a capital of Ngh\u1ec7 An Province in Vietnam, is not on the Mekong Delta. \rInstead, Vientiane is the capital city of Laos, and that's the answer you're looking for.  A city steeped in Buddhist tradition, Vientiane was somewhat isolated from the rest of Southeast Asia for many years despite being a very short distance from the Thai border.  The Mekong River, which passes from China and into Myanmar before running through Vientiane and into Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the South China Sea, has been one of the main arteries for trade in the region for more than a thousand years. \n"}, {"text": "Which American 'V' city, built just for luxury resorts and skiing, is placed squarely in the Mountain Time Zone?", "correct": "Vail", "options": ["Vallejo", "Van Nuys", "Venice Beach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVail.\n\n\tVallejo, Venice Beach, and Van Nuys are all locations found in the Pacific state of California and as such they're all part of the Pacific Time Zone, one hour behind Colorado in the Rocky Mountains.  Vail, one of Colorado's many resort towns, is known for being built up as a skiing haven in the 1960s and the cottages there were actually built to accommodate the tourism industry after the hills were established. Vail has since been home to the largest ski hill in the state despite other nearby destinations (like Aspen and Nevada's Lake Tahoe) also taking a fair share of winter sports enthusiasts. \n"}, {"text": "Seize your opportunity!  Your next, great destination is the justifiably quintessential double-'V' pick.  The city is 'Valencia', but here's my question: what country, of these, is it in?", "correct": "Venezuela", "options": ["Vanuatu", "Vatican City", "Vietnam"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenezuela.\n\n\tAlthough there are also Valencias in Spain and California, Valencia, Venezuela is the surprisingly rare double-V since only four nations in the world start their names with V.  Some other similar destinations include Vanua Lava, Vanuatu and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, Vietnam.  Valencia, however, is the capital of Carabobo State in North-Central Venezuela and grew to become the third-largest city in the nation after Caracas and Maracaibo. Surrounded by coastal mountains, Valencia is an industrial city and, interestingly, it's a sister city of Valencia, Spain.  It was not named after said city though; it was named after Valencia de Don Juan. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these place names is found in Hong Kong, Australia, and British Columbia, and is Africa's largest lake?", "correct": "Victoria", "options": ["Veracruz", "Vladimir", "Villanova"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictoria.\n\n\tVictoria, as a name, stems from the British Empire, as one would expect, since Hong Kong, Australia, and Canada all share that common link.  Victoria is the capital city of British Columbia, found on the West Coast of Canada on Vancouver Island.  Victoria is also a state in Australia containing the cities of Melbourne and Geelong. In Hong Kong, Victoria was the capital during British reign; in modern days it's the central region of the city.  Additionally, Lake Victoria is Africa's largest lake, split between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania; it's the second-largest lake in surface area in the world. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Russian destinations is worth the trip if you're looking to be on the Sea of Japan?", "correct": "Vladivostok", "options": ["Vologda", "Volgograd", "Voronezh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVladivostok.\n\n\tIn one of the furthest-east spots of Russia, Vladivostok acts as a major port on the Pacific more than nine thousand kilometers from the nation's capital, Moscow-- that's a six-and-a-half-day train ride on the Transsiberian!  Interestingly, it's under a tenth of the distance to get to Sapporo, Japan, and Pyongyang, North Korea is even closer than that.  Although smaller than a number of Russian cities in population, it's about the same size as another far-east city, Khabarovsk, just eight hundred kilometers north. \n"}, {"text": "Mosi-oa-Tunya is where you can boldly walk on the Razor's Edge, or you can just go and relax on a far-from-quiet trip to the Zambezi to see what famous 'V' wonder?", "correct": "Victoria Falls", "options": ["Valley of the Kings", "Venetian Canals", "Vesuvius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVictoria Falls.\n\n\tVictoria Falls sits on the Zambesi River between the nations of Zambia and Zimbabwe and is one of the most well-known waterfalls in the world simply due to its immense volume and size, especially during wetter seasons in the African savannah.  One of the top tourist destinations in both nations, Victoria Falls is home to a complex that also contains resorts that bring visitors up close and personal with the falls and the area. Amongst the sites of Mosi-oa-Tunya (also known as 'The Smoke That Thunders') are the nearby town of Livingstone (named after the explorer) and the Razor's Edge, a small footbridge that crosses in front of the falls. \n"}, {"text": "Traveling in a daze as much as you do, it can be extremely trivial just to think about distance.  Regardless, I'll inquire.  Which of these places is the furthest from the others?", "correct": "Varanasi", "options": ["Verona", "Venice", "Versailles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVaranasi.\n\n\tVersailles, Venice, and Verona are all European cities with Versailles outside of Paris, France and Venice and Verona both in Northern Italy.  Versailles is, of course, home to the famous Palace of Versailles while Venice, Italy is known for its romantic canals and Verona was the real-life setting of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\".  Varanasi, however, is thousands of miles away in India on the Ganges River.  Considered by many to be one of India's holiest cities, especially in Hindu culture, it's a site of pilgrimage, especially for those in their later years. \n"}, {"text": "If you wanted to go south to visit a 'V' destination, you could do no better than which of these mountains, the furthest south of those listed?", "correct": "Vinson Massif", "options": ["Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa", "Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco", "Vogelsberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVinson Massif.\n\n\tThe Vogelsberg Mountain range is in Germany and is the furthest north of the options while both Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa and Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco are in Central America (the former is the tallest peak in Panama and the latter is the tallest in Guatemala).  None of them hold a candle to the Vinson Massif, the eighth-tallest peak in the world just over one thousand kilometres from the geographic South Pole.  Reaching up 4,892m above sea level, Vinson Massif was one of the last ultra-high peaks to be ascended (in the 1960s) and is, of course, daunting due to the polar environment. \n"}, {"text": "If you're just looking for a 'V' destination bound for South America, which of these likely piques your crazy, exploring nature?", "correct": "Valpara\u00edso", "options": ["Vancouver", "Veliky Novgorod", "Visalia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValpara\u00edso.\n\n\tValpara\u00edso is one of the largest cities in the nation of Chile and is one of the largest Pacific seaports on the continent, building much of its industry around its spot as a shipping hub and, originally, a port for explorers seeking passage around the southernly Strait of Magellan.  Valpara\u00edso is also known for its vibrancy and its hilly landscape. Despite being on the water, the city was constructed on the rolling hills near the ocean and during its boom days, it flourished and grew to become a UNESCO-protected city for its importance in Latin culture and, to a large extent, European culture due to its significance in world exploration. \n"}]}
