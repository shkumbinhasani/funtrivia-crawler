{"id": "135275", "name": "\"Five on a Treasure Island\" -Enid Blyton Multiple Choice Quiz  | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", "Blyton, Enid", "Famous Five"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of the following is a reason given why Julian, Dick and Anne can't go away on holiday with their parents as they usually do?", "correct": "Their parents want to go away alone together on a trip to Scotland.", "options": ["Their father has to do some extra work at the office.", "Julian and Dick have to do extra school work.", "Their mother is too ill to travel."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTheir parents want to go away alone together on a trip to Scotland.\n\n\tIt seems extraordinary that children as young as Julian (12),Dick (11) and Anne (10) are going to be allowed to go away on holiday by themselves merely so the parents can enjoy themselves. The children all attend boarding schools so they won't see much of them anyway. However, at least the children are to stay with their aunt and uncle. \n"}, {"text": "How did Dick tease Anne about her packing for the holiday?", "correct": "He talked of  Anne wanting to take all her dolls and a rocking horse.", "options": ["He talked about all the pretty dresses she wanted to take.", "He talked of her spending hours getting ready.", "He talked about the giant size of the suitcase she wanted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe talked of  Anne wanting to take all her dolls and a rocking horse.\n\n\tDick is referring to how Anne behaved a few years ago and she goes red. Their mother redresses the balance by reminding them both of a little boy called Dick who had put aside \"two golliwogs, one teddy bear, three toy dogs and his old monkey\" to take on holiday when he was younger. \n"}, {"text": "How old is George/Georgina?", "correct": "eleven - the same as Dick", "options": ["ten - the same as Anne", "twelve - the same as Julian", "thirteen - she's the oldest"], "explanation": "\n\n\neleven - the same as Dick.\n\n\tAs the series develops George builds up the best friendship with Dick who is the same age as her. Julian appears to be in the story to be admired and to dominate over the others. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of the fisher boy who looked after Timmy?", "correct": "Alf", "options": ["Pete", "Jim", "Dave"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlf.\n\n\tGeorge spends all her pocket money to pay Alf for the food that Timmy eats. As a result of this she is never able to afford any sweets or ice-creams. Her cousins want her to share with them - in return they would like to share Timmy. \n"}, {"text": "Why did George kick Anne under the table as they were eating their meal?", "correct": "Anne was about to betray the secret of Timmy.", "options": ["Anne had just said that she wanted to play with dolls.", "It was just an accident but her mother thought it wasn't.", "Anne had said that George wasn't a real boy."], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnne was about to betray the secret of Timmy.\n\n\tGeorge has asked her three cousins to keep the secret of Timmy being with Alf, the fisher boy, a secret. Anne is so enthusiastic about the morning spent together that she says, \"We do like George - and we like Ti...\". At this point she gets a nasty bruise. \n"}, {"text": "As the old wreck is under the sea how does George know when the boat is over the right spot?", "correct": "By lining  up a church tower and the tip of the hill over the castle.", "options": ["She has a chart which shows the exact position.", "There is a floating buoy that is attached by line to the wreck..", "Timmy always barks straight away when they are near it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy lining  up a church tower and the tip of the hill over the castle.\n\n\tThis technique of lining up different objects so that you know you are on the right spot when you can see them all at the same time is used even more effectively to find a sunken boat in a later story in the series. \n"}, {"text": "What was the one thing that George won't allow Timmy to do when they get to the island?", "correct": "Chase the rabbits.", "options": ["Drink the water from the little spring.", "Go near the old well.", "Interfere with the jackdaws' nests."], "explanation": "\n\n\nChase the rabbits.\n\n\tIt is the dog's natural instincts to chase the rabbits. As there are no ordinary predators on the island the rabbits are naturally tame and do not run away as fearfully as most mainland ones would do. George can control Timmy by making a warning noise in her throat. \n"}, {"text": "What do they use to make a fire whilst they are sheltering on the island from the great storm?", "correct": "sticks that the jackdaws had dropped and sandwich paper", "options": ["bundles of old newspaper they find in the tower", "sticks that the jackdaws had dropped and their map", "the wrapping off the strange parcel they find"], "explanation": "\n\n\nsticks that the jackdaws had dropped and sandwich paper.\n\n\tIt was Anne who came up with the sensible idea of using the sandwich paper. As the oldest Julian is the one who is carrying the matches. \n"}, {"text": "What were the initials on the old wooden box they found on the wreck?", "correct": "H.J.K.", "options": ["H.P.K.", "J.H.M.", "P.I.K."], "explanation": "\n\n\nH.J.K.\n\n\tGeorge claims that they were the initials of her great-great-great grandfather who was called Henry John Kirrin. It seems strange that the wreck, the island and the cottage all belong to Aunt Fanny. They have descended through the female line and yet in later books the family name seems to be Kirrin. Possibly cousins married each other. \n"}, {"text": "How did the children finally break the old box open?", "correct": "They threw it out of the attic window so that it cracked on falling.", "options": ["They used a screwdriver to remove the hinges.", "They used a hammer and chisel to knock off the lock.", "They managed to hit the wood with a sledgehammer."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey threw it out of the attic window so that it cracked on falling.\n\n\tThe box fell on to an area of crazy paving. Naturally this made a tremendous noise and Uncle Quentin came out to see what had caused it. In his anger he decided to confiscate the box and its contents. \n"}, {"text": "Which word did they find on the map that filled them with excitement?", "correct": "ingots", "options": ["jewels", "gold", "treasure"], "explanation": "\n\n\ningots.\n\n\tDick and Julian both know that \"ingots\" can mean any metal in the shape of bars. However, there has always been a story that gold was connected with the wreck and with the Kirrin family. Thus naturally they start thinking of treasure in the shape of piles of gold bars. \n"}, {"text": "What reason has the buyer given for wanting to have Kirrin Island?", "correct": "He is going to rebuild the castle as a hotel.", "options": ["He wants to use the island as the centre of a yacht marina.", "He wants to preserve the island as a nature reserve.", "He wants to explore the island for hidden treasure."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is going to rebuild the castle as a hotel.\n\n\tUncle Quentin proves himself to be remarkably unitelligent when it comes to anything other than his scientific investigations. The reader is constantly told that access to the island is almost impossible and yet he believes that someone wants the castle for a hotel. He also ignores the map and the chance of treasure. \n"}, {"text": "How did they manage to find the entrance to the old well on the island?", "correct": "Timmy fell part of the way down it when chasing a rabbit.", "options": ["Dick's spade made a hollow sound when he struck wood.", "Julian heard the distant sound of stones falling into water.", "Anne sat down on a wooden bench and fell part way through."], "explanation": "\n\n\nTimmy fell part of the way down it when chasing a rabbit.\n\n\tFortunately for the children (and the dog) there is a stone slab jammed a little way down the well. Otherwise Timmy might have kept on falling until he reached the bottom. Julian drops a stone but they never hear it splash. There is also a convenient ladder that goes part of the way down. \n"}, {"text": "How did George warn Anne and Dick about the dangerous men when she composed the note that they forced her to write and then send via Timmy?", "correct": "She signed the note with her real name \"Georgina\".", "options": ["She managed to write some words in code.", "She called them \"Roger\" and \"Anne\" instead of Dick.", "She wrote another secret message in lemon juice."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe signed the note with her real name \"Georgina\".\n\n\tBoth Anne and Dick knew that George would never sign herself as \"Georgina\" unless something was wrong. Dick goes to check at the little cove and when he finds another boat there he knows that there are strange men on the island who must be holding Julian and George prisoner. \n"}, {"text": "When the \"Five\" escape from the island how does George prevent the men from following them?", "correct": "She smashes the engine of their boat with an axe.", "options": ["She steals the oars from their rowing boat.", "She casts their boat adrift so that it floats away on the tide.", "She smashes a hole in the bottom of their boat with an axe."], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe smashes the engine of their boat with an axe.\n\n\tOne of the famous illustrations in this book shows George with the axe raised in the process of chopping downwards at the engine of the beached boat. In the background the other three are busy pushing off their own rowing boat with Timmy already safely in the prow. \n"}]}
