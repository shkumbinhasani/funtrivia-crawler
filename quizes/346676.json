{"id": "346676", "name": "Wars of the Worlds Quiz | Literature | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Literature Trivia", "Science Fiction"], "questions": [{"text": "H.G. Wells, in \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898), described alien invaders who came from a place relatively close to home: Mars. They sought to exterminate humanity, and they knew no mercy: around the world, all hope seemed lost. But then help came, from an unexpected quarter. How were the Martians defeated?", "correct": "By microbes", "options": ["By Venusians", "By livestock", "By snow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBy microbes.\n\n\tWells pulled no punches in the moral of his story. Humanity's proud technological achievements, fruits of the Industrial Revolution, were for naught against this nemesis. Instead, tiny, insignificant microbes -- causing diseases to which the Martians had never been exposed -- saved the day. Humanity survived, but the insult to our pride was grave. \n"}, {"text": "Before the Space Age, history teachers talked about the Hundred Years' War, but for those who fought it \"The Forever War\" was far more disorienting. To battle the Taurans, we sent conscripts through collapsars to distant planets - but even the survivors could never truly go home again. Why not?", "correct": "Due to relativity, centuries had passed on Earth even during a brief tour.", "options": ["Returning soldiers carried a disease that could have wiped out life on Earth.", "Military body modifications were incompatible with Earth's environment.", "During the war, the Taurans destroyed Earth."], "explanation": "\n\n\nDue to relativity, centuries had passed on Earth even during a brief tour.\n\n\tJoe Haldeman's 1974 novel gets much of its punch from Einstein's theory of special relativity. Collapsar travel - like the wormholes common in later science fiction - allowed shortcuts through the fabric of the universe, but conscripts had to travel large distances at nearly the speed of light just to get to the collapsars, and then from the collapsars to the next battlefield.So, they experienced a relativistic phenomenon called time dilation, and when they returned to Earth they found that time had passed much more quickly at home than it had for the travelers. Friends and family were gone. The culture had changed radically.\"Future shock\" drove many right back into the military, where things were at least familiar. It's a beautifully written treatment of time dilation, culture shock, casually cruel bureaucracy, and futile war - no wonder it won a Nebula, a Locus, and a Hugo. \n"}, {"text": "We never learned whether the slug-like things had intelligence of their own, but they nearly conquered us even so. They came from Pluto, touched down near Des Moines, and turned their human hosts into fifth columnists. Robert Heinlein recorded this story; who were our attackers?", "correct": "The puppet masters", "options": ["The pod people", "The Andromeda strain", "The snails"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe puppet masters.\n\n\t\"The Puppet Masters\" (1951) followed an agent in a secretive arm of the U.S. government. He and a few other agents realized the fact of the invasion, gathered intelligence, and eventually developed counter-measures. Along the way, our hero became host to a puppet master, which controlled his mind from a spot on the back of his neck, and he didn't much like having his strings pulled. The book ended with a much more naked populace (to allow verification that nobody was carrying a puppet master) and a mission of vengeance to Pluto. \n"}, {"text": "They were machines created for war, implacable in their programmed goal: to destroy all life. At first, they were more successful than had ever been dreamed, wiping out the enemy root and branch. But no one had told them when to stop, and next they turned on their makers -- and then, the rest of the galaxy. Who were these beings of war, stars of a series by Fred Saberhagen?", "correct": "The Berserkers", "options": ["The Kzinti", "The Terminators", "The Puppeteers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Berserkers.\n\n\tThe Berserkers, named after Viking warriors in a fighting frenzy, were intelligent spacefarers, capable of designing and building more Berserkers in a variety of forms. First appearing in the 1963 story \"Without a Thought\", they were the one thing capable of uniting all sentient life in the galaxy, though their methods certainly made them ineligible for any peace prize. Saberhagen's stories were fine military science fiction, full of futuristic hardware and desperate ingenuity. \n"}, {"text": "The Star Kingdom of Manticore was a peaceful place, made wealthy through trade. So how did it end up embroiled in decades of interstellar war with several successive governments of the Republic of Haven? And how did it end up annexing so many systems that it had to change its name to the Star *Empire* of Manticore? The answers are perhaps best chronicled in the life of one of Manticore's greatest military heroes, a treecat-bonded woman who was somehow always in the thick of things. Name her.", "correct": "Honor Harrington", "options": ["Haley Starshine", "Cordelia Naismith", "Jane Sagan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHonor Harrington.\n\n\tDavid Weber's \"Honor Harrington\" series begins with \"On Basilisk Station\" (1992), which saw our heroine's first starship command as well as her first foiled Havenite plot. Her ensuing adventures showed parallels to English and French history in the late 1700s and early 1800s, sometimes quite transparently: one Havenite revolutionary leader was actually named Rob S. Pierre. But the series was saved by its clear, tight sketches of strategy and tactics; by an appealing cast of secondary characters, including the sentient alien treecat Nimitz; and by Honor's own personal strengths. \n"}, {"text": "With thousands of sentient peoples around the galaxy, all competing to settle roughly the same set of habitable worlds, there was bound to be conflict. So the Colonial Union, charged with shepherding humanity to the stars, assembled an army. In John Scalzi's \"Old Man's War\" (2005), how did they go about doing this?", "correct": "They recruited elderly people from Earth and gave them new bodies.", "options": ["They built robotic soldiers, and hired Earth's veterans to command them remotely.", "They conscripted a certain number of teenagers from every colony.", "They cloned their most highly decorated veterans, again and again."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey recruited elderly people from Earth and gave them new bodies.\n\n\tThis clever series inverted the usual historical situation: young and middle-aged bureaucrats of the Colonial Union were backed by an army of the old. Men and women from the industrialized nations of Earth signed up to enlist when they reached 75. At that happy time, they'd be brought into orbit and given new, youthful, cloned bodies, helpfully dyed green and endowed with significant enhancements. But the battles were dreadful, the casualty rates were horrific, and it soon became clear that the universe didn't work quite the way that the Colonial Union had led them to believe... \n"}, {"text": "As Larry Niven told it, humanity's introduction to Known Space was not a happy one. Pacifists by culture and conditioning, human spacefarers were attacked, setting off the first of the brutal Man-Kzin Wars. What Earth species did the vicious kzinti most resemble?", "correct": "Tigers", "options": ["Octopus", "Wolves", "Jellyfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTigers.\n\n\tAs described in countless works, starting with the 1966 short story \"The Warriors,\" the kzinti were essentially eight-foot-tall, bipedal great cats -- but they could hardly be tamed. An adult kzin would be called by his job title until he earned a name by proving himself in battle. (They were basically all male, but let's not go into that here.) Initially, they thought the peaceful humans would be easy targets -- but, as Niven memorably showed, that conditioning only ran skin-deep. \n"}, {"text": "It may surprise you to know that our alien foes landed on Earth in 1942. Expecting from outdated satellite data to face no military technology more formidable than swords and shining armor, the Lizards were startled to find themselves fighting several industrialized powers in the midst of military and technological buildup. What star of alternate history chronicled the Lizards' confusion and the humans' revenge?", "correct": "Harry Turtledove", "options": ["Catherine Asaro", "Isaac Asimov", "Frank Herbert"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Turtledove.\n\n\tThe Lizards -- or, as they called themselves, the Race -- weren't looking to wipe out humanity. They simply wanted to prepare the way for a colonization of Earth, with a subjugated populace able and willing to do the heavy lifting. But conquest is tougher than annihilation, and the battling nations of World War II were hardly in a mood to surrender. From Jewish partisans to American baseball players, from German tank commanders to Chinese Communists, \"In the Balance\" (1994) and its sequels in the \"Worldwar\" quartet were epic in scope. \r (Not quite global in scope, however. Most unfortunately, any lands south of the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and the South China Sea might as well not have existed, for all the role they played in these tales.) \n"}, {"text": "Within a multi-planet empire, there should be peace, but in this one, terrible wars between the noble houses were distressingly commonplace. Worlds did not often fight due to the high prices charged by the Guild for troop transport, but the Harkonnens paid a fortune to go after the Atreides family and their Fremen supporters on the planet of Arrakis. What book chronicled this epic struggle?", "correct": "Dune", "options": ["Ender's Game", "1632", "Dragonflight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDune.\n\n\tFrank Herbert's \"Dune\" came out in 1965, and the mix of sci-fi elements, feudal setting, harsh environment and prophetic religion proved hugely popular. As the sole source of the all-important \"spice,\" which prolongs life and facilitates interstellar navigation, the desert planet was always fated to be a pawn in feudal power struggles.When the Emperor brought in his feared Sardaukar troops, fresh from the prison planet of Salusa Secundus, young Paul Atreides staked everything on Arrakis's nomadic Fremen warriors -- and, guided by prophecy, they staked everything on him. The tale of their war is gripping and tightly drawn. \n"}, {"text": "The invasions, from the destruction of our asteroid colonies to the Scourging of China, changed life on Earth. To begin, it was illegal to have a third child, except by special permit. We sent our best and brightest children to space to train as our admirals. And when Ender Wiggin finally ended that threat, our child tacticians nearly tore the world apart. What Earth animals most resemble the enemies we remade our world to fight?", "correct": "Ants", "options": ["Fish", "Birds", "Giraffes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnts.\n\n\tLike ants, the insectoid enemy drones lived to obey the orders of their queen; unlike ants, each queen's hive mind was vast, clever, and insightful. They wanted our solar system and they didn't realize we were individuals; when they cut down our workers, soldiers and colonists on our space habitats, they didn't think we'd miss them any more than we'd miss our toenail clippings.\r They were wrong.\r Orson Scott Card's 1985 novel \"Ender's Game\" told how the last of these wars ended. The \"Shadow\" series then followed that war's chaotic aftermath; the \"Speaker for the Dead\" series traced Ender Wiggin's quest for redemption. \n"}]}
