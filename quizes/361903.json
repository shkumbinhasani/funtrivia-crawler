{"id": "361903", "name": "The Lingo of \"Jersey Shore\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television H-K", "Jersey Shore"], "questions": [{"text": "What does the 'L' stand for in 'GTL'?", "correct": "Laundry", "options": ["Ladies", "Life", "Lounging"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaundry.\n\n\t'GTL' is a lifestyle for the \"Jersey Shore\" housemates and the construction of an ideal day.  The first component is the 'Gym': the guys (and occasionally the girls) hit the gym to look their best and feel better.  The second component is 'Tan'-- you've got to get your tan on to fit in as a Guido or Guidette!  The final component, completed over the course of the day, usually when G and T are enacted, is 'Laundry', which ensures you're 'fresh to death' before heading out to the club. \n"}, {"text": "What word is used to refer to 'having sexual relations'?", "correct": "Smushing", "options": ["Cuddling", "Beaching", "Shoring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSmushing.\n\n\t'Smush' was a term adopted early on in the series and, in essence, has to do with sleeping with another person in a mainly sexual nature.  In almost every residence occupied by the housemates (the shore house, the Miami beach house), a 'Smush Room' has been set aside, presumably to avoid any lewd behavior in the general living space.  Unfortunately, many nights resulted in several 'acquisitions', male or female, and sometimes the housemates needed to call dibs on the room.  As a couple, the room was taken most often by Ron and Sam seeking a private space to build their relationship early on. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a term used to describe a less-than-good-looking woman found at a club?", "correct": "Grenade", "options": ["Gator", "Hater", "Blowout"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrenade.\n\n\tOver the course of the show, the housemates, especially the guys, have elaborated on their classification system for unattractive women.  Although it started with grenades, the roster has grown to include landmines, tanks, submarines, and the A-bomb.  The misogyny doesn't end there though-- some women have been referred to as hippos, butter-faces, clingers, stalkers, and grenade launchers. In season two, the guys of the house established the GFF, the Grenade-Free Foundation, in an attempt to further tighten the standards by omitting all women under a certain caliber from visiting the beach house. \n"}, {"text": "'Blast in a Glass' would refer to which housemate who joined the show in season three?", "correct": "Deena", "options": ["Sammi", "Angelina", "Ryder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeena.\n\n\tAfter Angelina's second abrupt departure (in season two), the seven shoremates returned to Jersey the next summer with a new roommate in tow-- Snooki's friend, Deena Cortese.  A self-proclaimed 'Blast in a Glass', Deena doubled the meatball power on the show, compounding Snooki's overall meatball-ness and bringing her own brand of party into the mix.  She remained with the show for four seasons until the end of the series, ultimately integrating into the surrogate family created by the octet. \n"}, {"text": "In season three, JWoww and her then-boyfriend-eventual-fiance Roger got into a fight when he was accused of pulling what move?", "correct": "The Dip", "options": ["The Swerve", "The Tuck and Roll", "The Swoop"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Dip.\n\n\tHeading to the gym, the roommates were surprised to see Roger driving alongside them on the streets near the shore but, to their shock, he pulled 'The Dip' on them, avoiding them entirely as if on purpose.  Jenni was initially uncaring about the situation but her male roommates naturally stirred the pot by hypothesizing that it meant he was cheating on Jenni with another woman.  Such wasn't the case at all-- it was just another scenario blown too far out of proportion.  It wasn't long before they made their relationship official; he proposed to her in 2013, a year after the show ended. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the 'Staten Island Dump'?", "correct": "Angelina", "options": ["Vinny", "The Situation", "JWoww"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAngelina.\n\n\tWalking into the shore house on day one with her clothes in garbage bags, Angelina Pivarnick made herself a force to be reckoned with, fighting with guests, fellow housemates, and others over the course of her two-season (minus a few episodes) stint on the show.  After leaving a week into season one and then getting on everyone's bad side with her lies and deceit in season two, Angelina was deemed 'The Staten Island Dump' after sleeping with Vinny (who is also a Staten Island native).  She has also been called the 'Rob Kardashian of Staten Island'.  She left Miami with a week left in the group's stay; she didn't return for the next several seasons. \n"}, {"text": "Where would you be most likely to see a 'Jersey Turnpike'?", "correct": "On the dancefloor", "options": ["In Miami", "At the T-shirt shop", "On the boardwalk"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn the dancefloor.\n\n\tJersey Turnpiking is a bit lewd and it refers to a dance in a club where a woman bends over in front of a male dancer in a sexual way.  The cast of \"Jersey Shore\" popularized the move (along with fist-pumping, which is exactly as it sounds) and admitted that it is a move indicating that a woman is DTF, essentially ready to go home with a guy.  The move is Deena's signature dance technique and, despite its notoriety, she and the others are well aware of its tastelessness. \n"}, {"text": "In Miami, the boys of the house created 'MVP'.  This was amended in season three (back at the Jersey Shore) when they added what wing-woman to their line-up?", "correct": "Deena", "options": ["Snooki", "Sammi", "Jenni"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeena.\n\n\t'MVP' stands for 'Mike, Vinny, Pauly', and it is an obvious reference to them being the Most Valuable Players, able to bring back women from the club and have a good time.  This trifecta had a chance to be penetrated in Miami when Angelina made several attempts to go to the club with them (though they childishly evaded her on several occasions) but it wasn't until Deena arrived in season three that they opened up their threesome to include Deena, the ultimate wing-woman. Always ready to go clubbing, Deena became the added D of MVP-D, dancing with girls and adding to the fun factor at the Shore's hottest clubs. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is the binary opposite to the oft-touted 'Girl Code'?", "correct": "Bro Code", "options": ["Man Code", "Guido Code", "There is no such thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBro Code.\n\n\t'Girl Code' is a term used for the unspoken vow held between girlfriends in regards to keeping secrets.  When a girl in the group decides to gossip about their girlfriends or not tell them pertinent information, they break the Girl Code.  This happened most notably in Miami when JWoww and Snooki wrote Sammi 'The Note' incriminating Ron for hitting on other girls at b.e.d.\rThe opposite would be Bro Code.  While the guys at the shorehouse are much less likely to embroil themselves in the drama there is an unspoken vow to have 'bros before hos'.  This doesn't always work, especially with Ron and Sam's on-again-off-again-on-again-off-again relationship over the six seasons. \n"}, {"text": "What drink is a staple in the shorehouse's pre-drinking ritual?", "correct": "Ron-Ron Juice", "options": ["Haterade", "Heineken", "Cosmos"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRon-Ron Juice.\n\n\tRon-Ron Juice made its first appearance early on in the first season.  Made with watermelon and berries, loads of vodka, and a blender, the drink seems to be quite refreshing and lends itself to a great deal of pre-club drink buzz.  Unfortunately, it also starts overwhelmingly drunk nights for some of the housemates, especially in Miami (Ron in particular nearly blacked-out starting his night with too-strong Ron-Ron Juice).  It was first created by Ron but has been mixed up by others over the course of the show.\r The drink's name also lends itself nicely to the term 'Juicehead' (or 'Gorilla Juicehead'), a term used to refer to a jacked-up guido who has more muscles than brain cells. \n"}]}
