He suffered persecution and exile, dying a prisoner in Palestine, but his writings became the basis of Baha'i teachings. \n"}, {"text": "Baha'i is structured less formally than many other religions; there are no set public rituals or priesthoods.

Like the others, its nine sides and single dome represent the unity of the human race. Also like the others, it's an extraordinarily beautiful {building;} if you're ever in the Chicago area, I recommend a side-trip.
