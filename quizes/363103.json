{"id": "363103", "name": "It Gets Better Quiz | Drop a Letter | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Brain Teasers Trivia", "Drop a Letter", "Drop a Letter 10 Questions"], "questions": [{"text": "Start with an eight-letter word that is an adjective meaning shocking, or filled with horror.  You may think of a film called \"_ Bosses\".", "correct": "Horrible", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHorrible.\n\n\tI had eaten some boiled okra as a young child, and the taste was horrible!\r Typically, horrible is a word with a negative connotation.  I cannot recall using it with a smile on my face.  But do not worry, the quiz gets better! \n"}, {"text": "Drop a letter from the previous word and scramble the remaining to get a young chicken that is good for roasting or grilling, or perhaps a special part of the stove that cooks said chicken in a special way.", "correct": "Broiler", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBroiler.\n\n\tThe broiler of a stove cooks at a high temperature and relatively quickly.  Broilers are also special grills and gridirons used to cook meats and fish.  Ours is an outdoors grill with a special lid and is well contained, and great for cooking salmon.\r Broilers are also the young chickens which are perfect for similar cooking methods, including grilling, roasting and barbecuing. \n"}, {"text": "If you drop a letter, you get a six-letter word meaning an apparatus for heating water.", "correct": "Boiler", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoiler.\n\n\tA boiler is typically a device of some sort that uses fuel to heat water.  There are other types of boilers, but for the average person like myself, a boiler heats water.\r Also, a less commonly used definition is the person who heats the water, perhaps a chef ready to boil pasta.  They would, in reference to the heating water, be considered a boiler. \n"}, {"text": "If you drop a letter then scramble the remaining, you get a five-letter word meaning a type of bay window, one that sticks out from the rest of the building, and doesn't reach the ground.", "correct": "Oriel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOriel.\n\n\tWhere I live, there are unfortunately hardly any oriel windows.  These projections from a wall are typically found on the second floor, but can be found on the first level as well.  The windows are common in Arab culture.\r If you are familiar with the television show \"Full House\", the opening scene showing the outside of the Tanner residence displays the oriel window quite nicely. \n"}, {"text": "Gamers may be familiar with the term RPG.  Those three letters are an abbreviation, and the R stands for a word that can be found if you drop a letter from the previous word and scramble.\n\nFor those who may not know what an RPG is, the word is also used to describe and actor's part in a production.", "correct": "Role", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRole.\n\n\tAn actor or actress is cast for a character in a movie or a play, and the character they play is considered their role.  My favorite role is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, but that's another quiz!\r An RPG, as many online gamers will recognize, stands for Role-Playing Game.  In these games, you are, essentially, an actor portraying the in-game character (playing the role of said character).  Then there is the MMORPG, which is the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. \n"}, {"text": "Now we add letters.  If you add one letter to the previous word, and scramble, you get a word meaning the second place finisher of a two-man race.", "correct": "Loser", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nLoser.\n\n\tSecond place sounds like a great way to finish a race, but when there are only two contestants, it is, unfortunately, also last place.  There is the winner of the race, who beat all the others, and the loser of the race is the one who held up the rear.\r Of course, no one likes being considered the \"loser\" of a race, so I prefer to always look at it as \"second place\" if there are two, \"third place\" if there are three, etc. \n"}, {"text": "Add one letter and scramble what you have to make a six-letter word that describes a soup\u00e7on of food, perhaps a Hershey chocolate sized portion.", "correct": "Morsel", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorsel.\n\n\tA morsel of food is a small taste, just a nibble, of said food.  I typically view a morsel as something delicious, something you savor.  I would never savor a \"morsel\" of okra, I would consider it a nasty chunk.\r In baking, chocolate chips are often used, and sometimes, they are referred to as morsels.  I do love Hershey's semi-sweet morsels baked in my favorite brownie mix! \n"}, {"text": "Add a letter and scramble to get a seven-letter word meaning a feeling of confidence, psychologically.", "correct": "Morales", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMorales.\n\n\tThe state of your psychological well-being as being confident and cheerful is known as morales (or morale).  If someone does not feel like they can do something, we typically try to encourage them by \"boosting their morales\".  A few encouraging words or some friendly thoughts can increase that person's psychological confidence to help them through whatever difficult task it was they thought they couldn't do. \n"}, {"text": "Imagine a member of Parliament or of Congress who is dismissed from office.  There is a seven-letter term for that.  However, we are adding a letter from the previous answer and scrambling to get an eight-letter word, so imagine two members who are dismissed from office.  Therefore, the term we are looking for is the collective term for more than one person who is dismissed from office.", "correct": "Removals", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRemovals.\n\n\tSometimes, a person of high authority in a government does not do as good a job as expected, and for whatever reason, may be dismissed from their position.  This is known as a removal of office.  Of course, if more than one have been dismissed, they could be collectively known as \"removals\". \n"}, {"text": "Now if you add one last letter to the previous word, and of course mix the letters up a bit, you get a word meaning extraordinary, showing a sense of wonder.  The word is also used by Billy Crystal in a certain \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.", "correct": "Marvelous", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarvelous.\n\n\tRemarkable, amazing, stunning, wonderful, brilliant!\r All words above are synonyms of marvelous, which is something extraordinary, or causing great wonder.  Billy Crystal joined \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1984, and in that year, Fernando Lamas was introduced.  Fernando often used the phrase \"You look mahvelous!\"\r A much more exciting term than horrible, don't you think? \n"}]}
