{"id": "114901", "name": "Hardest \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\" Part 2 Trivia Quiz | Movies | 20 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Star Trek", "ST II: The Wrath of Khan"], "questions": [{"text": "For most of the film, Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban) wears a shirt that shows off a well-defined set of pectoral muscles.  True or false: Montalban wore a prosthetic device in order to give Khan the appearance of a highly muscular chest.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tDirector Nicholas Meyer emphatically states several times on the DVD that the chest we see is actually Ricardo Montalban's.  No prosthetic of any kind was employed. \n"}, {"text": "A shuttle carrying Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and several of his bridge crew approaches the ENTERPRISE while it is still in spacedock.  Where, exactly, does the shuttle dock with the starship?", "correct": "port side, torpedo bay", "options": ["starboard side, shuttle bay", "starboard side, torpedo bay", "port side, shuttle bay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nport side, torpedo bay.\n\n\tCommander Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) is instructed to approach \"port side, torpedo bay\" as he guides the shuttle toward the ENTERPRISE. \n"}, {"text": "Technically, Kirk and company are only boarding the ENTERPRISE for the purposes of a training mission.

What is his relation to Commander Montgomery Scott (James Doohan)?", "correct": "he is Scotty's nephew", "options": ["he is Scotty's stepson", "he is Scotty's son", "he is Scotty's grandson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhe is Scotty's nephew.\n\n\tIn the restored version of the film seen on the DVD -- and in the TV version of the film -- we hear Scotty tell Kirk that Preston is his sister's youngest child.  This explains why Scotty was so distraught upon Preston's death following Khan's first attack on the ENTERPRISE. \n"}, {"text": "When Kirk accesses the top-secret file pertaining to the Genesis Project, he is subjected to a procedure to confirm his identity.  What portion of himself does he need to present for this scan?", "correct": "his retina", "options": ["his voice", "his blood", "his thumbprint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nhis retina.\n\n\tRetina scans were still \"futuristic\" in 1982, but less than a decade later, they became real-life fixtures in certain high-tech circles. \n"}, {"text": "Kirk, Dr. McCoy (DeForrest Kelley), and Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) watch a recording of Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) describing the Genesis Project.  How long ago was the recording made?", "correct": "one year", "options": ["six months", "three months", "two years"], "explanation": "\n\n\none year.\n\n\tKirk states that the proposal was made \"about a year ago.\" \n"}, {"text": "James Horner composed the remarkable score for \"Star Trek II.\"  Which of the following films did Horner *not* score?", "correct": "\"The Abyss\" (1989)", "options": ["\"Aliens\" (1986)", "\"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock\" (1984)", "\"Cocoon\" (1985)"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"The Abyss\" (1989).\n\n\tSome passages from Horner's \"Aliens\" score were used in the trailers for \"The Abyss,\" but Alan Silvestri scored the actual film. \n"}, {"text": "Lt.

Which general order does she quote?", "correct": "General Order 12", "options": ["General Order 4", "General Order 16", "General Order 9"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeneral Order 12.\n\n\tSaavik: \"General Order 12 states that, on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been established...\"  We never hear the rest of it, because Spock cuts her off. \n"}, {"text": "Finish this quote from Khan: \"Have you ever heard the Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish that is best served __________?\"", "correct": "cold", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncold.\n\n\tKhan follows this up with, \"It is very cold... in space.\" \n"}, {"text": "Which character does *not* use the mild curse \"damn\" in this film?", "correct": "Scotty", "options": ["Saavik", "Kirk", "Chekov"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScotty.\n\n\tSaavik says \"Damn\" during her KOBAYASHI MARU test, which is odd for a Vulcan.  Kirk says, \"This is damn peculiar\" as the RELIANT approaches with no communications.  Chekov, once he realizes that he and his captain are in Khan's territory on Ceti Alpha V, says, \"We've got to get out of here.  Damn!\"  Scotty has used this word in other \"Trek\" films, but not in this one. \n"}, {"text": "After Khan's surprise attack cripples the ENTERPRISE, he demands that Kirk give him all the data he has on the Genesis Project.  How long does Khan declare that Kirk has to retrieve this information?", "correct": "one minute", "options": ["two minutes", "three minutes", "thirty seconds"], "explanation": "\n\n\none minute.\n\n\tKhan tells Kirk that he only has one minute, but the actual time that elapses before Khan says \"Time!\" is just over *two* minutes.

Who is the first to find a dead body?", "correct": "McCoy", "options": ["Uhura", "Kirk", "Saavik"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMcCoy.\n\n\tMcCoy literally bumps into a dead man hanging upside-down.

How does he know this?", "correct": "Rigor mortis has not yet set in.", "options": ["The blood is still wet.", "The telltale smell of dead bodies does not yet exist.", "Cellular decay has not yet taken place."], "explanation": "\n\n\nRigor mortis has not yet set in.\n\n\tMcCoy: \"Well, rigor hasn't set in yet.

In fact, since Joachim is easily in his twenties, it would be impossible for Khan to have fathered him after the Ceti Alpha V exile (15 years ago). \n"}, {"text": "As the ENTERPRISE is about to lead the RELIANT into the Mutara Nebula, Spock uncharacteristically uses a metaphor to explain to Saavik why Kirk has decided to do so.  What animal does Spock invoke in this metaphor?", "correct": "a goose", "options": ["a bear", "a dog", "a snake"], "explanation": "\n\n\na goose.\n\n\tSaavik asks why Kirk wants to enter a nebula where sensors and shields will be useless.  \"Sauce for the goose, Mr. Saavik,\" Spock says.  \"The odds will be even.\" \n"}, {"text": "Spock's intuition saves the day, as usual, once the ENTERPRISE and the RELIANT are playing hide-and-seek in the Mutara Nebula.  He assesses Khan's tactics, and reports to Kirk: \"He's intelligent, but not experienced.  His actions suggest two-dimensional thinking.\"  This observation prompts Kirk to tell Sulu to change the ship's \"z\" orientation -- its \"vertical\" stance.  How far does Kirk tell Sulu to \"drop\" the ENTERPRISE?", "correct": "ten thousand meters", "options": ["fifty kilometers", "one hundred kilometers", "five kilometers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nten thousand meters.\n\n\tKirk: \"Mister Sulu -- 'z' minus ten kilometers.\"  \"Dropping\" the ship in such a manner allows Kirk to maneuver under and behind the RELIANT.  Eventually, the ENTERPRISE is directly behind the RELIANT, which allows for a significant tactical advantage.\r One more quiz to go!  Stay tuned for Part 3. \n"}]}
