{"id": "394713", "name": "\"The Good Place\" (Season One) Trivia Game | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "G"], "questions": [{"text": "What message is printed on the waiting room wall when Eleanor Shellstrop wakes up in The Good Place?", "correct": "\"Welcome!  Everything is fine.\"", "options": ["\"We're sorry, but you have died.  Stay calm.\"", "\"Please remain seated.  Someone will be with you shortly.\"", "\"Welcome!  Feel free to have some refreshments.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Welcome!  Everything is fine.\"\n\n\tThe message is written in large, friendly, green letters.  After reading it, she sighs and smiles.  Then Michael opens his office door and invites her in. \n"}, {"text": "After hearing Michael's praises about her life on Earth, Eleanor realizes that she doesn't belong in The Good Place.  She was actually an overall bad person.\n\nWhat is a bad act that Eleanor did on Earth that was typical of her personality?", "correct": "She borrowed a roommate's dress, ripped it, then let her roommate think it was the dry cleaner's fault", "options": ["She shoplifted groceries, especially drink mixes, by smuggling them out in a baby carriage", "She would drive drunk", "She slept with her roommates' boyfriends, by coordinating everyone's schedules so she'd have access to the men"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe borrowed a roommate's dress, ripped it, then let her roommate think it was the dry cleaner's fault.\n\n\tThis was detailed in Chapter 8: \"Most Improved Player\".  \r Eleanor had asked her roommate to borrow her peach-colored dress for a business function; her roommate said no.  Eleanor borrowed it anyway.  But as she was trying it on, the zipper ripped quite extensively.  She took off the dress and put it back in the dry cleaning bag it was in.  \r When her friend finally noticed it, Eleanor said nothing, and let her roommate believe that the dry cleaner had damaged the dress.  So her roommate sued the dry cleaners, which bankrupted the business.  The story of the lawsuit was spread on social media, including an unflattering picture of her roommate.  \r Eleanor and another friend took that picture and had it printed on T-shirts with the caption \"Dress Bitch\".  They then sold these T-shirts online and made a healthy profit.  And the first think Eleanor bought with her share: a peach-colored dress that was the same style as her roommate's, but that fit her. \n"}, {"text": "Of the four main humans, which one was not called by their real name in the beginning?", "correct": "Jianyu Li, a Tibetan monk", "options": ["Eleanor Shellstrop", "Chidi Anagonye, a moral philosophy professor", "Tahani Al-Jamil, a Pakistani-British socialite/philanthropist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJianyu Li, a Tibetan monk.\n\n\tJianyu was actually a Filipino-American named Jason Mendoza.  He was an amateur DJ/dancer/drug dealer from Jacksonville, FL.  What helped him stay undercover was that as his mistaken identity as a Tibetan monk, he supposedly had a vow of silence that Michael had asked if he wanted to keep.  Realizing he was also not supposed to be in The Good Place, he decided to remain silent, which kept him under the radar for quite a while. \n"}, {"text": "Eleanor's presence in The Good Place supposedly causes disruptions in the normal operation of the neighborhood.  \n\nWhich of the following is NOT an effect supposedly caused by Eleanor's presence?", "correct": "Everyone's clothes change to an ugly purple and pink paisley pattern", "options": ["Trash falls like rain", "Mean giraffes run rampant through the neighbornood", "Large shrimp are seen flying through the sky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEveryone's clothes change to an ugly purple and pink paisley pattern.\n\n\tEveryone's clothes *did* change to the same pattern.  Except it was a blue and yellow jagged stripe pattern.  Eleanor's clothes were the only ones that didn't change, which indicated that she was the cause of the glitch.  Janet provided her a new outfit with the pattern so that she wouldn't stand out at the neighborhood meeting. \n"}, {"text": "The only way in or out of the neighborhood is by a train.  Who is the only entity that can operate that train?", "correct": "Janet", "options": ["The Lead Architect", "Michael", "Mindy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJanet.\n\n\tJanet, the not-a-robot that can create nearly anything in an instant, is the key to the neighborhood.  It exists only by her existence.  She is therefore the only entity that can bring anyone in or out of the neighborhood. \n"}, {"text": "What is the designation of the neighborhood?", "correct": "Neighborhood 12358W", "options": ["Neighborhood 12345", "Neighborhood Janet-1024", "Neighborhood Michael-1"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNeighborhood 12358W.\n\n\tThe digits in the neighborhood's designation are the first five Fibonacci numbers. \n"}, {"text": "What type of paintings decorate Eleanor's home in The Good Place?", "correct": "Clown paintings", "options": ["Shirtless firemen pictures", "Pablo Picasso", "MC Escher prints"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClown paintings.\n\n\tThe \"real\" Eleanor Shellstrop supposedly loves clown paintings, but they give the \"fake\" Eleanor the creeps.  She only *wishes* that there were shirtless firemen pictures instead. \n"}, {"text": "What is Michael's favorite color?", "correct": "Pleurigloss", "options": ["Heaven white", "Blue", "Diamond clear"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPleurigloss.\n\n\tPleurigloss is not perceptible by human eyes.  It's best described as: When a soldier comes home form war and sees his dog for the first time. \n"}, {"text": "Mindy St. Claire is a human that the main humans meet who does not live either in The Good Place or The Bad Place, but in The Medium Place.  Why was she placed there?", "correct": "She had been bad in life, but on her last night, she planned a huge good deed", "options": ["She did lots of good things in The Bad Place, so she was moved to The Medium Place", "The afterlife's database had no record of who she was, so she was placed in The Medium Place", "She did bad things in The Good Place, so she was moved to The Medium Place"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe had been bad in life, but on her last night, she planned a huge good deed.\n\n\tOn Earth, Mindy was a greedy corporate lawyer who used too much cocaine.\r On her last night on Earth, Mindy decided that she needed to do something good with her life.  She drew up plans for a foundation that would help children around the world, promote human rights, etc.\r So the next morning, Mindy went to the bank and cashed out her life savings to start her charity.  However, she died that morning after falling on subway tracks and being electrocuted.\r Her sister found her plans for the foundation, and used Mindy's money to start it.  It became the largest relief and charity on Earth.  The Good and Bad Places argued over whether the posthumous good deed counted.  \r Instead of Mindy going to either of those places, The Medium Place was created just for her.  It's actually rather a tortuous place, as she was alone for 30 years before Eleanor and friends came to visit.  She usually walks around naked and pleasures herself on a whim.  Her one request of her new friends/visitors is that they bring some cocaine the next time they visit.  Only once has someone remembered her request. \n"}, {"text": "In Chapter 13: \"Michael's Gambit\" (the season finale), Eleanor had an epiphany about her situation in the The Good Place.  What was that epiphany?", "correct": "She and the others were actually in The Bad Place", "options": ["She was actually a Good Place architect that had lost her memory", "She was in love with Tahani", "They were actually there to test Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShe and the others were actually in The Bad Place.\n\n\tSupposedly, The Bad Place was supposed to get \"fake\" Eleanor so that \"real\" Eleanor could take her place in The Good Place.  But the Bad Place demons, as well as Shawn, the Eternal Judge, said that as long as two people went to The Bad Place, the balance would be satisfied.  The humans argued, going back and forth as to who would go and who would stay.  That's when Eleanor has her epiphany; she, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason have been torturing each other by design, which meant they were in the Bad Place all along.\r She calls for Michael and Shawn, and overrides the last agreement as to who would go to the Bad Place; she volunteered herself and Chidi to go.  Shawn said that was unacceptable, but she countered that he'd said he'd abide by whatever they'd agreed to.  When Shawn continues to hem and haw about sending her and Chidi, she reveals to everyone that they're in the Bad Place, and that Michael has been manipulating them the entire time.  The camera then focuses on Michael, who gives a truly evil laugh, and admits that she's correct. \n"}]}
