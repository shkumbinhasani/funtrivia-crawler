{"id": "293267", "name": "Kyle and Salami Play Co-Op 2 Quiz / Test | Video Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", " Video Games Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "\"You know, Kyle,\" Salami started. \"There are some games I just don't like.\"\n\"Like what?\" kyle asked\n\"Well, for instance, there is this game I played about a year ago where an earthquake has hit.  You have to save people from the aftermath.\"\n\"Oh, I know that game.  I didn't like that game.  It wasn't very well received.\"\n\"Yep, I think you know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nWhat video game are Kyle and Salami discussing?", "correct": "Disaster Report", "options": ["Crash and Burn", "Earthquakes!", "Rumble Road"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDisaster Report.\n\n\t\"Disaster Report\" was released in Japan in 2002, and Europe and North America in 2003.  The game is about Keith Helm, played by Casey Robertson, trying to rescue people after an artificial island collapses.  He also must dodge falling buildings from the aftershock of the earthquake.  You must find a way to be rescued.  The game takes place in 2001.  You meet several people along the way, but not all of the rescued will survive. \n"}, {"text": "\"I for one,\" Kyle began, \"do not like \"Grand Theft Auto\". Sure, the storyline is okay, but I find it's an attempt at shock value.\"\n\"Maybe it's a bit unrealistic,\" Salami added.\n\"Agreeably so. I think that they prided themselves off pushing the envelope a little too much there.\"\n\nDespite being a best-selling series, which \"Grand Theft Auto\" title became an Adults Only game after the discovery of a certain minigame?", "correct": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas", "options": ["Grand Theft Auto: 4", "Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories", "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\n\t\"San Andreas\", first released on the PS2 in 2004, was under the spotlight in later years due to its infamous Hot Coffee mod, which allowed players to complete a minigame revolving around intercourse. To combat the ESRB suspension and the backlash from concerned parents, Rockstar Games began releasing \"San Andreas\" with the minigame removed entirely in order to maintain a Mature (17+) rating.\rRegardless, the game proved a popular title (possibly because of the controversy) and it was dubbed one of the greater games released on the Playstation 2 that year. Since then, \"Grand Theft Auto 4\" was released on PS3 and Xbox, becoming one of the highest-scoring video games (in terms of critics and reviews) to date and selling six million copies within the first week of sales. This iteration continues to feature 'mature-rated themes', allowing players to drink and drive, steal automobiles, and beat non-playable characters to a pulp. All part of the American dream, eh? \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle,\" Salami commenced. \"As you know, I love \"Crash Bandicoot\" games.\"\n\"Yes, I know,\" Kyle confirmed.\n\"There is a game, however, that I do not like, that is Crash.\"\n\"Oh yeah, Salami, what is that?\"\n\"Well, Kyle, it is a game where you are always in vehicles.  I don't like racing games, and this one is no different.\"\n\"Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.\"\n\nWhat are Kyle and Salami talking about?", "correct": "Crash Tag Team Racing", "options": ["Crash Bash", "Crash of the Titans", "Crash Twinsanity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrash Tag Team Racing.\n\n\t\"Crash Tag Team Racing\" has been made for the PS2, the Gamecube, the XBox, and the PSP.  The game was released in North America in October of 2005, in Europe November 2005, and Japan the following month.  It is the 12th installment of \"Crash Bandicoot\" games, and the first to have a rating higher than E, in North America.  It is rated E 10+ for cartoon violence and crude humor. \n"}, {"text": "\"Online Play is an important factor for some games, though in the case of one, it's fairly obvious that it's not a friendly worldwide web,\" Kyle stated.\n\"What do you mean?\" Salami asked.\n\"Case in point, \"Counter-Strike\". What bothers me is that the people who play that game play it so much that it seemingly ousts new players.\"\n\nWhat well-known company developed \"Counter-Strike\" and its following sequels?", "correct": "Valve", "options": ["Blizzard", "Bungie", "NCSoft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValve.\n\n\t\"Counter-Strike\" first hit Beta in 1999, and since that date, the game has been a popular online arena-type FPS. The thing about it, though, is the fact that so many people do play it, yet a few of the 'leet' players tend to wipe 'noobs' out almost instantly. The game has major connections with \"Half-Life\", another of Vavle Corporation's major games in the series (along with \"Team Fortress\" and \"Portal\"), and although it is quite popular, it's oversaturated with these frequent players.Besides that, the game is prone to hackings, and in other words, many players tend to cheat by running through walls, turning off gun recoil, and removing effects of certain weapons to gain a strong advantage in the game.\"Counter-Strike: Source\" was released in 2004 to relatively good reviews. This game made use of the \"Half-Life 2\" engine, much like the predecessor made use of the first game's engine. \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, I love \"Spyro\" games,\" Salami said.\n\"Yes, Salami, you have mentioned that once or twice,\" Kyle said sarcastically.\n\"I know, but I do.\"\n\"Salami, where is this going?\"\n\"Oh yeah, my point!  There is one \"Spyro\" game I just don't like.  It was the first \"Spyro\" made that was different than the rest.  Head butting is the main attack, and you have limited fire power.  It follows a story, and doesn't use portals like the other ones before it.  It was released for the PS2.\"\n\"I think I know what you're talking about.  Give me a minute, and I may come up with it.  I agree with you, the new way wasn't as good as the first four.\"\n\nWell, it has been a minute.  What game is Salami talking about with Kyle?", "correct": "Spyro: A Hero's Tail", "options": ["The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning", "The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night", "The Legend of  Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpyro: A Hero's Tail.\n\n\tThe original \"Spyro\" trilogy consists of \"Spyro the Dragon,\" \"Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage,\" and \"Spyro 3: Year of the Dragon.\"  Two individual games came out, the first being \"Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly,\" where dragonflies have gone missing and you must find them, and \"Spyro: A Hero's Tail.\"  This game was released in 2004.  The next trilogy starts back at the beginning of Spyro's life, the trilogy being labeled \"The Legend of Spyro.\" \n"}, {"text": "\"Wow!\" Kyle exclaimed.\n\"Wow is right!\" Salami replied.\n\"No, I mean \"World of Warcraft\". That game bothers me to no end. Endless grind quests only beaten after months and months of persistent, redundant gaming. Blizzard should have just worked on their other series.\"\n\nWhat other gaming series did Blizzard Entertainment not make?", "correct": "Sims", "options": ["Diablo", "Starcraft", "Warcraft"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSims.\n\n\tLike most other MMORPGs, \"World of Warcraft\" has the player select a profession and species to determine a player character, and it has said player travel around a literal world completing quests, levelling up, and defeating bad guys. The premise continues through tens of levels until a max level cap is reached and all regions of the world are explored.A cap also occurs with weapons, which are unique in their own ways as well, however there is always a 'best weapon' to obtain. Shortly after accomplishing its first few million players, Blizzard released the game's first expansion pack, \"The Burning Crusade\", and has since become the largest MMORPG. The game is also pay-to-play, which means that all players must subscribe to membership to pay, and renew after a certain time. \"The Sims\" was developed by Maxis, and they have sold millions of units of games for consoles, handhelds, and PC, worldwide. \n"}, {"text": "\"You know, Kyle,\" Salami began, \"I just don't like games that are not good examples for kids.\"\n\"But they're just games, Salami,\" Kyle reasoned.\n\"I know, but remember years ago several boys died because they were copying a TV show and tied themselves to a train track.\"\n\"But that was just stupid.  People know better.\"\n\"Right, but not all do.  There is a game I don't like, because it is extremely graphic, and encourages you to shoot people.  It re-enacts WWII, the worst war in history.  I just don't like the series.  It encourages warfare, yet the world wants peace.\"\n\"I suppose you're right, Salami.  What is that game called?\"\n\nWhat game are Kyle and Salami talking about?", "correct": "Call of Duty & Medal of Honor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCall of Duty & Medal of Honor.\n\n\t\"Call of Duty\" is a video game series set in WWII, except for \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.\"  It is a first person shooting game.  The games are published both by Activision and Aspyr Media.  The game is also developed by several companies: Infinity Ward, Grey Matter Interactive, Spark Unlimited, Treyarch, Pi Studios, and Amaze Entertainment.  The first \"Call of Duty\" was released on the 29th of October, 2003. \n"}, {"text": "\"I have to admit, while war games are on the lower half of my favourites list, sports games are even lower,\" Kyle continued.\n\"Why is that?\" Salami inquired.\n\"Let's just say, if I wanted to play a sports game, I'd do it in real life.\"\n\nWhich sports game was released first?", "correct": "Duck Hunt", "options": ["SSX", "Sega Bass Fishing", "NHL '94"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDuck Hunt.\n\n\t\"Duck Hunt\" was first released on consoles in North America in 1985 on the NES unit, and since then, it is one of the console's top-selling games, having been bundled with the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" installation. The release of this game also marked the first game to make use of the NES Light Gun, which could be used to shoot the ducks on the screen as the game was played. Aim was a requirement, and some of us don't have any.\r\"SSX\" is a snowboarding game first released in 2000, though since its release, numerous sequels have been added to the roster. Predating this, for the same sport, was \"1080 Snowboarding\" for the Nintendo 64. \"Sega Bass Fishing\" originated on the Sega Dreamcast, but has since been produced for the Wii (allowing players to authentically cast and reel in the Wii remote). \"NHL '94\" was one of the first annual hockey games to be released by EA Sports, one of the biggest names in sporting games in the video gaming world. It was released on the SNES. \n"}, {"text": "\"Kyle, I don't like sports games real well, either.\" Salami stated. \"I don't like bloody and violent video games, like the war games we talked about earlier.  The video game I like least is one that was endorsed by Tom Clancy.\"\n\"Oh yeah, I like that game.  It is rated T, but it is a good game based on the novel by Clancy.\"\n\"Right!  I don't like that one.\"\n\nWhat game does Salami not like?", "correct": "Splinter Cell", "options": ["Harry Potter", "The Shining", "Lord of the Rings"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSplinter Cell.\n\n\t\"Splinter Cell\" was released in Japan, Europe, and the United States in November of 2002.  The game follows Sam Fisher, the main playable character of the game.  Quite a bit of the game involves being secretive.  You use shadows and darkness to hide and sneak around buildings and such, trying not to get caught.  However, being rated T, it is a very violent game. \n"}, {"text": "\"You know what?\" Kyle began, \"I have a bit of a vendetta against the Playstation 3 in general.\"\n\"Why Kyle?\" Salami asked, \"The system is a powerhouse.\"\n\"And that's precisely all it is. Sure, the graphics are there, but the game choice is lacking.\"\n\nWhat game is found on the Playstation 3?", "correct": "Folklore", "options": ["Blue Dragon", "No More Heroes", "Lost Odyssey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFolklore.\n\n\tWhile \"No More Heroes\" was one of many Wii exclusives, and \"Blue Dragon\" and \"Lost Odyssey\" were completely different Xbox 360 RPG exclusives (both made by Square Enix), \"Folklore\" for the Playstation 3 is one of few RPG exclusives for Sony's third home console, which fell to the bottom place of the seventh generation console race. Released in October 2007 (in North America), the game was one of the few to make integral use of the Sixaxis controller's motion sensitivity in battle, and while the graphics, storyline, and soundtrack were astounding, players were put off a bit by gameplay, and as such, the game received varying reviews.\rRegardless, the game was one of the few and far-between titles of the system in its earlier years that was both exclusive and original, and though it was one of the pushed titles for the 2007 holiday season, reception by shoppers was somewhat lukewarm compared to the sales of \"Lair\", \"Clive Barker's Jericho\", \"Timeshift\", and \"Kane and Lynch: Dead Men\", all of which garnered worse reviews. Despite this, however, Sony made up for it with the sales of 'Ratchet and Clank: Tools of Destruction\", the wide release of \"Guitar Hero 3\" and \"Rock Band\", \"The Orange Box\", \"Call of Duty 4\", \"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune\", and \"Assassin's Creed\", only two of which (\"Ratchet and Clank\" and \"Uncharted\") were exclusive titles. \n"}]}
