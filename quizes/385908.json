Tomkins, and Aaron Paul amongst others, and features a mix of animated humans and animal who, in the show, are also essentially human and among us.  The lead character, Bojack, is a former TV actor (of the hit '90s show 'Horsin' Around'), but in the present day he seeks fulfillment and acceptance, at the same time both intentionally and unintentionally pushing his closest friends away.
