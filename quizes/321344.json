{"id": "321344", "name": "Bible Gs Quiz | Bible Alphabetics | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Religion Trivia", "Bible Alphabetics", "A-K"], "questions": [{"text": "In what is traditionally called the \"Great Commission\", what does Jesus tell his followers to do?", "correct": "Go and make disciples", "options": ["Give generously from the heart", "Gather the lost sheep", "Grow in grace and truth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGo and make disciples.\n\n\tIn Matthew 28:16-20, Jesus tells the eleven apostles to \"Go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Farther, Son and of the Holy Spirit...\". He begins his commission by declaring he has been given \"all authority in heaven and earth\". This statement, coming shortly after his resurrection, shows a critical turning point in what Christians believe is God's redemptive plan. His believers also notice that in issuing this charge, the scope of their mission also has been enlarged from going to the \"lost sheep of Israel\" to going to \"all nations\". \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these is an angel mentioned by name in the Bible?", "correct": "Gabriel", "options": ["Gadfly", "Gadara", "Gideon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGabriel.\n\n\tGabriel appears in both the Old Testament (Daniel 8:16, 9:21, 22) and New Testament (Luke 1:22-20, 26-33). He is the angel who appears to Mary to announce that she is going to be the mother of Jesus. Gabriel is commonly referred to as an archangel but is not referred to as such in the Bible. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the prophet Hosea's immoral wife? ", "correct": "Gomer", "options": ["Geraldine", "Gershwin", "Gilda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGomer.\n\n\tHosea lives in and prophesies to the northern kingdom of Israel during the last years of its existence. God tells Hosea to marry an \"adulterous wife\". There has been debate on why God would make such a demand on Hosea and if this represents an actual historical event or is just an allegory. Many scholars believe that Gomer was a well known prostitute and that God wanted to use this family to illustrate Israel's apostasy and God's steadfast love for them.After Gomer leaves and embarrasses herself and her family in adulterous living, Hosea goes to an auction to buy her back and bring her home as his wife.Christian believers use this story as an example of God's love and forgiveness. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Jesus arrested? ", "correct": "Garden of Gethsemane", "options": ["Gate of the Guard", "Gedera", "Gehenna Valley"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGarden of Gethsemane.\n\n\tGethsemane, which is Greek for \"olive press\", was located near Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley (John 18:1) and on the Mount of Olives (Luke 22:39). Jesus takes his disciples there after \"The Last Supper\". It seems that this garden is a customary gathering place for Jesus and his disciples (Luke 22:39, John 18:2). The gospels record that, after spending time there in agonizing prayer, Jesus is approached by Judas, and, after being betrayed by Judas' kiss, is arrested. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these words is NOT associated with David's most famous military victory?", "correct": "Gehena", "options": ["Goliath", "Giant", "Gath"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGehena.\n\n\tGoliath is the Philistine warrior whom young David kills with his slingshot at the Valley of Elah. The Bible says that Goliath is six cubits and a span tall, which has been estimated as being between seven and a half to nine feet tall. Although the text does not call him a giant, he has traditionally been referred to as such throughout history. Goliath's hometown is Gath. You can read this story in I Samuel 17. \n"}, {"text": "According to the King James Version, what object does God tell Jeremiah to wear without washing before hiding it in a crevice in the rocks?", "correct": "Girdle", "options": ["Garments of gold", "Goatskin ephod", "Garlic necklaces"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGirdle.\n\n\tIn Jeremiah 13, God tells Jeremiah to get a girdle and wear it for an extended period of time without washing it. What the King James Version calls \"girdle\" the New International Version calls a \"linen belt\". These belts were a strip of cloth usually made of wool used to help hold up a man's undergarments.The belt served as a pocket for storing such items as coins, knives or food. Sometimes the undergarment would be tucked in the girdle when walking or working. God appears to want Jeremiah to use his girdle to teach an object lesson. After hiding the belt, God instructs Jeremiah to retrieve the now dirty and decaying belt to show Judah how disobedience and pride have hurt their relationship with God. \n"}, {"text": "Where is Jesus crucified? ", "correct": "Golgotha", "options": ["Gath", "Goshen", "Gudgodah"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGolgotha.\n\n\t\"Golgotha\" is a Hebrew/Aramaic term meaning \"the place of the skull\". It is used to describe the place where Jesus and two thieves are crucified in Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22 and John 19:17. Luke, in his account of the crucifixion, uses the Greek word for \"skull,\" which is \"Calvary\". Although there has been much speculation on why this site was called \"the place of skull,\" no one is sure of the reason.Some theories include that the place was traditionally a place where executions took place and was littered with the skulls of the condemned. Others believe that the site was near a hill that had the shape of a skull.\n"}, {"text": "What is the first book of the Bible?", "correct": "Genesis", "options": ["Galatians", "Gospel of the Gentiles", "I Gorinthians"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGenesis.\n\n\tThe name \"Genesis\" is a transliteration of the Greek word meaning \"origin\".   It is considered part of the Pentateuch or Torah (first five books of the Bible). Moses is believed by some scholars to be the author. As its name suggests, the book reveals the origin of the universe, plants, animals, humankind, sin, death and redemption. Major characters in the book include Abraham, Noah, Jacob and Joseph. \n"}, {"text": "In what area was Jesus raised? ", "correct": "Galilee", "options": ["Galatia", "Gerazim", "Gilgal"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGalilee.\n\n\tGalilee was located in Northern Palestine. In New Testament times it was a populous center of Jewish commerce and culture. Much of Jesus' ministry seems to have been centered in the Galilean city of Capernaum and Jesus grew up in the town of Nazareth. Eleven of Jesus' original twelve apostles came from Galilee (Judas was from Judea). Most of Christ's miracles were performed here and many of his parables were taught in this region. \n"}, {"text": "According to the Apostle Paul's writing in Ephesians 2, by what is a person saved?", "correct": "Grace", "options": ["Good works", "Going to church", "Generosity"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrace.\n\n\tThe theme of divine grace runs through entire Bible. Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9 says, \"For it is by grace you have been saved through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works so no man can boast\". In the Bible grace, refers to God's unmerited favor offered to his creatures. According to the New Testament, that favorable disposition is supremely seen in God offering his son Jesus as an atoning sacrifice for mankind's sin. \n"}]}
