From a treatment perspective, what is the most important thing to determine?", "correct": "What reward the dog gets from performing the problem behavior", "options": ["How often the dog performs the problem behavior", "What the owner has done to try and correct the problem behavior", "The dog's history of previous problem behaviors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhat reward the dog gets from performing the problem behavior.\n\n\tDog behavior (as well as the behavior of every animal!) is described by one very potent equation. Dogs will repeat behaviors that get them something that they want or need, and will not repeat behaviors that do not get them what they want or need. As behaviorists term it, \"Reinforced behavior is repeated behavior.\" \"Problem behaviors\" are not problems for the dog; they function very well to get the dog something it wants.Finding out what the dog is getting is the first step to treating problem behaviors because only then can we devise ways for the dog to get what it wants in a non-problematic manner. \n"}, {"text": "Most common dog behavior problems can usually be treated by one of three strategies. Which of the following is not one of these strategies?", "correct": "Punishing the problem behavior", "options": ["Rewarding a substitute behavior and redirecting the problem behavior", "Ignoring the problem behavior and rewarding an alternate behavior", "Preventing the problem behavior from occurring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPunishing the problem behavior.\n\n\tPunishment alone will not solve dog behavioral problems. Punishment, at best, only \"tells\" the dog what NOT to do- it gives the dog no direction on what he should do. Without some instruction in \"how to do it right,\" another problem behavior is likely to crop up. \n"}, {"text": "For which of the following dog behavioral problems is a professional consultation recommended?", "correct": "Aggression", "options": ["Jumping up", "Barking", "Chewing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAggression.\n\n\tWhile most dog behavioral problems are safely dealt with by the average owner, aggression problems, especially towards people, are best handled with the assistance of a qualified behaviorist. Such a person can determine the cause of the aggression (dominance aggression, territorial aggression, fear aggression, predatory aggression, etc.) and recommend safe, non-confrontational methods of treatment. \n"}, {"text": "Let's say your pooch is jumping up on you every time you walk in the door. Which of these methods is a suitable treatment for this problem?", "correct": "Ignore the dog when he jumps up and immediately pet and praise the dog when he has \"four on the floor.\"", "options": ["Step on the dog's toes when he jumps on you", "Bump the dog in the chest with your knee when he jumps up", "Put the dog on a choke chain and leash, and jerk the dog down when he jumps on you, firmly telling him \"Off!\""], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgnore the dog when he jumps up and immediately pet and praise the dog when he has \"four on the floor.\"\n\n\tRemember that the first step in solving any behavioral problem is to determine what the dog is trying to get. In this case, the jumping dog wants your attention and interaction. What we want to teach the dog is how to get such attention \"the right way\"- a way that is acceptable to us. So, in this case, we ignore the jumping (turning away from the dog, not looking at or speaking to the dog) thus denying the dog the reward it expects to obtain from jumping- our attention. Then, to show the dog how to get what it wants, we pet and praise the dog the instant that all four feet are on the floor. Remember that reinforced behavior is repeated behavior! \r  The other, physically confrontive methods do not work because they do not follow sound behavioral principles. The dog is still getting attention for jumping (even though we would not see the attention as positive) and is not being taught an alternate method of obtaining the attention he desires. \n"}, {"text": "Your dog \"steals\" items like shoes. When spotted with the forbidden object, he runs from you. If you don't see him, he sneaks off into a hidden corner and chews up the shoe. What is the most likely cause of this behavior?", "correct": "Punishing the dog for inappropriate chewing", "options": ["Teething", "Guilt because he knows the behavior is wrong", "Giving the dog shoe-shaped chew toys"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPunishing the dog for inappropriate chewing.\n\n\tChewing is intrinsically reinforcing to the dog. If you catch the dog with a shoe and punish the dog, this doesn't teach the dog what he should chew. It also doesn't teach the dog not to chew shoes. What it does teach the dog is not to chew shoes when you are around! The dog will still chew shoes quite happily when you are not there- there is no reason for him not to. In addition, the dog learns to run when he gets a forbidden item in order to avoid punishment. \r  So how do you stop chewing? Puppies should be constantly supervised, or left in dogproofed areas when they aren't under direct supervision. They should be given plenty of chew toys of their own, and highly praised for chewing them. This makes the toys much more attractive. When the dog gets ahold of a forbidden item, rather than punishing him, \"trade\" for an even better chewtoy and praise him for chewing the right thing! \n"}, {"text": "What one non-training action can dog owners take that will have the biggest effect in preventing/alleviating behavioral problems?", "correct": "Ensuring the dog gets sufficient exercise", "options": ["Feeding a low-protein diet", "Spaying/neutering the dog", "Consistently punishing bad behavior"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEnsuring the dog gets sufficient exercise.\n\n\tMost dog breeds were created to fulfill a specific job need- and these jobs, like hunting and herding, required tremendous expenditures of energy. Today's dogs may no longer work as hard as their forebears, but they still have the same exercise requirements. An insufficiently exercised dog must expend all that excess energy somehow- and barking, digging and chewing may well be how he does it! A tired dog is a good dog.\r Young dogs of working, sporting, herding and other active breeds typically require 20-45 minutes of hard aerobic exercise (walking doesn't cut it) just about every day!\r Some behaviorists believe that feeding a low-protein diet reduces a dog's energy and arousal levels. Spaying doesn't consistently prevent any behavioral problems. Neutering reduces roaming, marking in the house and some forms of aggression. \n"}, {"text": "Your outdoor dog digs holes- lots of them- near your back door and along the walls of the house. What is the most common reason for this behavior?", "correct": "Barrier frustration", "options": ["Pursuit of burrowing animals", "Boredom- the dog is digging for fun", "Making a cooling spot to rest"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBarrier frustration.\n\n\tDogs dig for all of the above reasons. The dog with barrier frustration is trying to gain access to an area from which it is blocked- in this case, the inside of the house. The solution for this digging problem is to bring the dog inside! \n"}, {"text": "The \"Nothing In Life Is Free\" program (NILIF) is often used to gain control over overly dominant, pushy dogs. Which of the following is *NOT* a component of this program? ", "correct": "The dog must initiate all games with the owner", "options": ["The dog must obey a command before getting anything it wants", "The dog is not given attention when the dog asks for it", "The dog is not allowed on furniture or beds"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe dog must initiate all games with the owner.\n\n\tNILIF teaches the dog that obeying has desirable consequences and that he is no longer the leader of the pack. It does this in a totally non-confrontational, non-violent manner. In brief, the dog must obey a command that he knows before he gets anything he wants- food, petting, games, access to the outdoors, etc.-reinforcing that the owner controls access to all good things for the dog and that listening to the owner is a good thing.In addition, the dog is not allowed access to \"high-status\" elevated areas that can encourage pushiness. Studies show that this program reduces dominance problems consistently when properly applied.\n"}, {"text": "Which of the following sources of puppies produces the highest percentage of adult dogs with behavioral problems?", "correct": "Pet stores", "options": ["Pounds and shelters", "Strays", "Breeders"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPet stores.\n\n\tOne study found that over 50 percent of pet-shop puppies had problems with dominance aggression or social fears as adults. Other behaviorists have reported that pet store puppies have much greater rates of separation anxiety than other dogs. These problems are due to a combination of genetics and deprivation issues- unsocialized pet store pups are weaned too early, traumatized by long travel at an early age, and otherwise stressed.In addition, most dog trainers find pet store puppies to be the hardest of all dogs to housebreak- unlike normal dogs, they have had to live in close proximity to their own urine and feces, and to eliminate in their \"dens\" since birth, and thus lack the desire to keep the den clean that normal puppies have.\n"}, {"text": "Your dog consistently destroys the house while you are gone. Every day, you come home to shredded pillows, torn chairs, and ripped paper. In addition, there is urine in front of the door. To top it off, your neighbors report that your dog barks constantly for hours while you are gone. What's the most likely reason for this behavior?", "correct": "Separation anxiety", "options": ["Illness", "Psychosis", "Aggression"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSeparation anxiety.\n\n\tDogs with separation anxiety suffer from overattachment to their owners- Dr. Niholas Dodman, a respected behaviorist, call them \"dogs who love too much.\" They literally cannot bear separation from their pack, and try to relieve their anxiety with frantic chewing. The problem is only worsened with punishment. Correct treatment involves independence training for the dog and often antianxiety drugs. \n"}]}
