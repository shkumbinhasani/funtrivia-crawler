{"id": "402197", "name": "Rise of the Phoenix Quiz / Test | Entertainment by Themes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes", "Myths and Legends in Entertainment"], "questions": [{"text": "\"The Order of the Phoenix\" is one of the books in what fantasy series?", "correct": "Harry Potter", "options": ["The Chronicles of Narnia", "The Lord of the Rings", "A Game of Thrones"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Potter.\n\n\tThe fifth book in the seven-book series about the boy wizard, Harry Potter, \"The Order of the Phoenix takes place during Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts (while he's between 15 and 16), shortly after the revelation that Lord Voldemort has obtained a physical form.  Lord Dumbledore created the Order of the Phoenix, a good-aligned society aiming to hold back Voldemort's evildoings, back in 1970.  Potter and his friends retake the mantle in this book as a result of the Ministry of Magic's general refusal to accept the turn of events.  Eventually, the Order's primary mission is to protect Potter. \n"}, {"text": "Many video game RPGS utilize a common item called the 'Phoenix Down'.  What does this item typically do?", "correct": "Revive a party member", "options": ["Grant flight", "Cure burns", "Grant invulnerability"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRevive a party member.\n\n\tPhoenix Down is, essentially, a phoenix feather used to bring a fallen comrade back to life if felled in battle.  Since most of the RPGs to utilize this item are turn-based, its use often relies on your ability to spend a turn doing so (or, in some cases, it can be automatic).  \"Final Fantasy\" is a key series that makes use of this consumable, doing so through most of its games.  The idea behind it makes use of the common idea that the phoenix is a creature of rebirth, rising from the ashes.  If used on an undead foe, the Phoenix Down might also have the ability to instantly kill them. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1965 film \"The Flight of the Phoenix\", what is 'The Phoenix'?", "correct": "A plane", "options": ["A blimp", "A famous actor", "A bird"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA plane.\n\n\tThe film pertains to an army plane that ends up downed in the desert and follows the events that transpire as the crew work to repair their aircraft and solve the problem of making it airborne again to survive their ordeal.  Released in 1965, the original was a bit of a bomb.  Starring James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Ernest Borgnine amongst others, it had the makings of a classic but never really lifted off.  In a moment of appropriate nature, the film was remade in 2004 in a version starring Dennis Quaid.  It similarly flopped. \n"}, {"text": "One of the original legendary bird Pokemon, which of these was designed to resemble a phoenix in the long-running video game series?", "correct": "Moltres", "options": ["Zapdos", "Lugia", "Articuno"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoltres.\n\n\tBack when the \"Pokemon\" series launched with 'just' one hundred and fifty Pokemon, Moltres was one of three legendary bird types framed around elemental power.  Found along Victory Road, he could use powerful fire moves against foes in battle.  His counterparts, Articuno and Zapdos, would wield ice and electricity.  Moltres wouldn't be the only phoenix-like bird Pokemon though.  In the subsequent generation, the legendary bird Ho-oh, the figurehead of \"Pokemon Gold\" was made to resemble a peacock and a phoenix. \n"}, {"text": "Released on their \"Save Rock and Roll\" album, which band released the single \"The Phoenix\" in 2013?", "correct": "Fall Out Boy", "options": ["Tenacious D", "Panic! at the Disco", "U2"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFall Out Boy.\n\n\tFollowing up on the success of \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\", \"The Phoenix\" helped propel this former 2000s punk band into a pop sphere.  \"Save Rock and Roll\" ended up being a major hit for Fall Out Boy going into the mid-2010s leading to a series of well-received albums (at least for fans).  \"The Phoenix\" charted internationally while \"Save Rock and Roll\" topped five different U.S. Billboard album charts (and one in Canada), reviving the band from the ashes of their less-popular earlier album, \"Folie \u00e0 Deux\". \n"}, {"text": "Which X-Men character transforms into Phoenix?", "correct": "Jean Grey", "options": ["Wolverine", "Cyclops", "Storm"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJean Grey.\n\n\tAs seen in several adaptations and in the original \"X-Men\" comics, Jean Grey's psychic powers come to a breaking point and push her to become Phoenix.  This happens, at the very least, in the films \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and \"Dark Phoenix\" where Famke Janssen and Sophie Turner filled these roles.  The extended \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" first appeared in the comics in the 1970s during which Jean was affected by a solar flare, inevitably needing to be killed to prevent her powers from wiping out humanity. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these online PC video games features a playable hero by the name of Phoenix who is, literally, a flaming bird?", "correct": "Dota 2", "options": ["Overwatch", "League of Legends", "Valorant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDota 2.\n\n\tPhoenix, as a character, is typically seen as a support hero but has viability in other realms.  Flying on wings of fire, Phoenix has the power to use said flames to attack foes from a range, swoop through the sky in arcs, and transition into an egg and force its own rebirth.  The latter technique is a risky one, however, since Phoenix is much easier to kill when it's in its egg, so this needs to be done when the moment is right or reinforcements are available to divert attention.  If it works, the skill can stun foes and turn the tide of battle. \n"}, {"text": "The Disney film \"Fantasia 2000\" ended with \"The Firebird\", an orchestral piece by what composer?", "correct": "Igor Stravinsky", "options": ["Dmitri Shostakovich", "Sir Edward Elgar", "Ludwig van Beethoven"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgor Stravinsky.\n\n\tTo close out this musical film, Disney animators brought Stravinsky's \"Firebird Suite-1919 Version\" to life, animating a tale to suit the music following a forest sprite as she survived the eruption of Mount St. Helen's, transforming herself to give rebirth to the land around the devastating volcanic blast.  The collection of pieces found in this film included Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 5\", George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", and a revisiting of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" (among others). \n"}, {"text": "The music video for what 2009 Kanye West song featured ballet dancers and a phoenix played by model Selita Ebanks?", "correct": "Runaway", "options": ["All of the Lights", "Power", "Love Lockdown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRunaway.\n\n\t\"Runaway\" became the stand-out track when Kanye released his short film based on his critically-acclaimed fifth album, \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\", and while the radio version of the song clocked in at under five minutes, the film version was closer to ten featuring a dinner party and ballet performance.  This dinner party included Selita Ebanks in the role of the phoenix who, at the end of the party, burst into flames.  It was ultimately regarded, by many music outlets, as one of the most significant videos of the year. \n"}, {"text": "Video game character Phoenix Wright has what profession?", "correct": "Attorney", "options": ["Detective", "Banker", "Adventurer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAttorney.\n\n\tFeatured in a handful of games on Nintendo handheld systems, \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\" is the star of his own visual-novel style stories in which he uncovers the truth to help his clients in court.
