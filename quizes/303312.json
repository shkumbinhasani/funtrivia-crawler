{"id": "303312", "name": "Super Bowl XLIII: Cardinals/Steelers Quiz | Sports | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "NFL Super Bowl", "Super Bowl 2000s"], "questions": [{"text": "After U.S. Central Commander David Petraeus flipped the initial coin toss (allowed by NFL executives and agreed upon by the Players Union), Pittsburgh lost the flip.  The Cardinals opted to kick the ball for some reason.  Pittsburgh opened the offensive game with a 38-yard pass to which Steeler?", "correct": "Hines Ward", "options": ["Heath Miller", "Nate Washington", "Matt Spaeth"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHines Ward.\n\n\tA much more important question than just a trivia question, this answered the Arizona Cardinals' questions whether or not Ward was actually capable of playing the game, or just being a decoy.  Hines had some leg injuries that kept Las Vegas oddsmakers at odds literally, and was stated by many that he was not able to play in this big game.  The Steelers' apparent result of their first drive was Pittsburgh QB Ben Roethlisberger running for the first score of the game.  However, after an appeal by the Cardinals, the replay officials deemed that Roethlisberger had not reached the goal line.  The first score was made by kicker Jeff Reed for his field goal instead.  Pittsburgh 3-0. \n"}, {"text": "On Pittsburgh's second scoring drive in the first quarter, and another 3rd and goal facing them as their very-first drive did, they had to wait for the beginning of the second quarter to finish it.  Who scored for Pittsburgh in the opening moments of the second quarter?", "correct": "Gary Russell", "options": ["Santonio Holmes", "Dennis Dixon", "Nobody did. The Steelers punted"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGary Russell.\n\n\tRussell had been a short-yard gainer with the team in 2008.  Gary scored only three touchdowns during the season.  His second quarter touchdown put the Steelers up 10-0. \n"}, {"text": "For the Cardinals' first score, they marched for 83 yards in nine plays in the second quarter.  Who caught Kurt Warner's pass for a touchdown, making the score 10-7?", "correct": "Ben Patrick", "options": ["Willie Parker", "Tim Hightower", "Levi Brown"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBen Patrick.\n\n\tPatrick didn't have a touchdown catch in the season, and had only caught a total of 114 receiving yards. \n"}, {"text": "The first half ended with an amazing and record play.  An interception was taken by a Pittsburgh player at the goal line with only a few seconds left on the clock. After a great drive by the Cardinals, who was this that intercepted this pass on the last play of the half, and ran it back for 100 yards for a Pittsburgh touchdown?", "correct": "James Harrison", "options": ["Bryant McFadden", "Dominique Cromartie", "Mewelde Moore"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJames Harrison.\n\n\tIn a Super Bowl record 100-yard pass interception, it was the longest defensive play in Super Bowl history.  The last play of the Cardinals' first half drive was this interception by Harrison.  The linebacker, who made the Pro Bowl for the first time in 2007, needed oxygen after the return while laying on the ground for a few minutes.  It would be the ultimate highlight of his NFL career.  The Steelers led the game at halftime, 17-7. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following is not true?  After the fantastic halftime fireworks display to help overshadow the voice of headliner Bruce Springsteen, who looked like Howie Mandell with a hair-piece during the halftime corporate commercial endeavors, the Cardinals opened the second half with a slow drive.  It ended with them fumbling at their own 26-yard line.  For the Steelers, they opened their first offensive drive of the half, aided by three Cardinal personal fouls, had a first and goal at the Cardinals' two-yard line.  The Cardinals stopped them three times with a goal-line defense.  The end result was a field goal that put the Steelers up 20-7.", "correct": "The Cardinals' first drive ended with a 50-yard punt", "options": ["The Cardinals had no personal fouls in the second half", "The Steelers went for the TD and failed.  There was no field goal", "Bruce Springsteen was not a halftime performer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Cardinals' first drive ended with a 50-yard punt.\n\n\tAfter the Cardinals had the ball for the opening of the second half, they ended up punting.  The Steelers then marched back into Arizona territory, aided with some rather questionable personal foul calls, had a first and goal, then second, then third and goal situation.  The Cardinal defense stood fast.  The Steelers had to settle for a field goal.  Steelers 20-7, and that's how the third quarter ended. \n"}, {"text": "Which Cardinal receiver scored the first fourth-quarter points by catching a pass for a touchdown?", "correct": "Larry Fitzgerald", "options": ["Dirk Johnson", "Edgerrin James", "Hines Ward"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry Fitzgerald.\n\n\tThe Cardinals' drive took only eight plays for a total of 87 yards, keeping them in the game.  The score after this play was Steelers 20, Cardinals 14.  Fitzgerald was the Cardinals' 'go-to guy' during the season.  He led the team with 96 receptions along with 1431 yards during the season. \n"}, {"text": "After a tremendous reverse goal-line stance by the Cardinals defense in the fourth quarter, backing up the Steelers at their own one-yard line, the Steelers had a 21-yard pass negated by a holding call.  What was the result of this call?", "correct": "It was a safety for the Cardinals", "options": ["It was an automatic touchdown for the Cardinals", "Fourth and ten from the one-yard line by Pittsburgh", "The Cardinals took over the ball at Pittsburgh's one-yard line"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was a safety for the Cardinals.\n\n\tSuper Bowl IX had the first safety in SB history- the Vikings fell on their own fumble in the end zone, and the Steelers scored a safety (the only points of the entire first half). \n"}, {"text": "In the fourth quarter, and a play from nowhere, Kurt Warner threw a 64-yard pass to which Cardinal for a touchdown, taking the scoring lead for Arizona?", "correct": "Larry Fitzgerald", "options": ["Carey Davis", "Lynn Swann", "Anquan Boldin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLarry Fitzgerald.\n\n\tThe fans were shocked on this play.

", "correct": "Santonio Holmes", "options": ["Rashard Mendenhall", "Hines Ward", "Heath Miller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSantonio Holmes.\n\n\tHolmes sealed the deal with tremendous catch for a touchdown two plays later, resulting in the winning score for the Steelers.  Although there were seven camera angles, the NFL booth reviewed the play, then validated that it was a tremendous catch by Holmes.  This was the not only the decided score, but the catch of the day. \n"}, {"text": "Which team won Super Bowl XLIII?", "correct": "Steelers 27, Cardinals 23", "options": ["Cardinals 23, Steelers 20", "Steelers 24, Cardinals 21", "Cardinals 21, Steelers 20"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSteelers 27, Cardinals 23.\n\n\tIt was a fourth quarter pass to Santonio Holmes that put the Steelers ahead with the final seconds remaining.

The Steelers were the first franchise in history to win six Super Bowls. \n"}]}
