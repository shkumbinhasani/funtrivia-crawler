Between their luxury and sports vehicles (ie. racers), Lotus is an expensive make.  The company is named after the lotus plant, one known for growing in/on water.  The name is also used for the title of Christina Aguilera's seventh album and Santana's first live recording.  Many know the lotus position as a cross-legged yoga movement made for meditation.  The national flower of India, its prominence as an icon in a number of Indian religions is unmistakeable. \n"}, {"text": "What work of fiction contains the line \"a rose by any other name would smell as sweet\"?", "correct": "\"Romeo and Juliet\" by William Shakespeare", "options": ["\"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Bronte", "\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen", "\"The Secret Garden\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Romeo and Juliet\" by William Shakespeare.\n\n\tPerhaps one of the most famous literary romances of all time, \"Romeo and Juliet\" tells the story of two lovers pining to be with each other, but marred by their warring families in the city of Verona, Italy.  Amongst one of Shakespeare's most well-known, oft-quoted tragic plays, \"Romeo and Juliet\" is also one of the most heavily adapted.  The quote comes at one of the most memorable scenes in Act II, during which Juliet says the \"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\" line.  Roses, of course, are a symbol of love. \n"}, {"text": "What flower, also known for opium production, is likely to be found in Flanders Fields?", "correct": "Poppy", "options": ["Orchid", "Lavender", "Geranium"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPoppy.\n\n\tThe red poppy is one best known for its association with war remembrance and, worldwide, is worn on the lapel of those who wish to commemorate the fallen soldiers and veterans of war.  Its imagery is particularly striking in Canadian John McCrae's poem \"In Flanders Fields\" in which he begins:\r \"In Flanders fields the poppies blow\rBetween the crosses, row on row,\rThat mark our place; and in the sky\rThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\rScarce heard amid the guns below.\"\r Poppies are also used in the production of poppy seeds and, as Elaine Benes discovered in an episode of \"Seinfeld\", powerful opiates. \n"}, {"text": "Super Mario usually has to save the damsel in distress, Princess Peach.  Who, according to Nintendo lore, is typically paired up with his brother, Luigi?", "correct": "Princess Daisy", "options": ["Princess Aster", "Princess Marigold", "Princess Daffodil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPrincess Daisy.\n\n\tPrincess Daisy appeared in the early Game Boy title \"Super Mario Land\" and then promptly fell off the map as Mario went on saving Princess Toadstool (later known as Princess Peach).  It wasn't until the later games of the Nintendo 64 that Nintendo resurrected the concept of a second princess, bringing Daisy into the picture as an additional female character for sports and party-based games and encouraging girls to play their main game line-up.  Daisy naturally pairs up with Luigi though very few games in the series have the green brother saving her from any evils. In fact, in the Wii U title \"New Super Luigi U\", he still saves Peach. Maybe she has enough sense to lay low and stay away from Bowser?  Daisies, like sunflowers, are found in the Aster family and they're known for their starburst-like petals emanating from their center. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these flowers is also the name of a colour considered virtually interchangeable with magenta?", "correct": "Fuchsia", "options": ["Lilac", "Hibiscus", "Violet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFuchsia.\n\n\tWhile the Fuchsia plant was discovered in the Caribbean in the late seventeenth century, its use as a colour of paints and dyes didn't emerge until the mid-nineteenth century where the shade was still called fuchsia until a battle in the Second Italian War of Independence (in a town called Magenta, no less).  Nowadays, the colours of magenta and fuchsia are one and the same, using identical components and intensities.  While a number of sources differentiate between the two for the sake of variety and colour choice, digital imagery does not; they have the same colour code online. \n"}, {"text": "What actress, appearing on several seasons of FX's \"American Horror Story\" and known for her theatre work, has a floral name?", "correct": "Lily Rabe", "options": ["Holly Hunter", "Rose Byrne", "Rose McGowan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLily Rabe.\n\n\tLily Rabe spent many years performing on the stage before making her move to movies and television.  After rave reviews for her role in the Shakespeare in the Park and Broadway productions of \"The Merchant of Venice\" in 2010 she took a role in Ryan Murphy's \"American Horror Story\" playing vastly different characters from season to season.  Her notable array of characters has included a tortured 1920s housewife, a nun possessed by a demon, and a free-spirited swamp witch with the powers of resurgence.  Lilies are delicate flowers found worldwide, notably in Asia. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these books, also the only one to contain a poisonous plant in the title, is about a girl moving around in foster homes while her mother is in jail?", "correct": "White Oleander", "options": ["The Name of the Rose", "The Black Dahlia", "Steel Magnolias"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhite Oleander.\n\n\t\"White Oleander\" by Janet Fitch found a great deal of fame as a bestseller after Oprah featured it in one of her book club segments on her show.

In the story, a woman, guilty, is charged with murder for lashing out at her lover with a deadly combination of drugs and oleander which inadvertently poisoned him.

The song saw a resurgence in 2012 when it was used in the James Wan horror film \"Insidious\", which made big bucks at the box office for its visceral scares and atmosphere. Tiny Tim, who played the song on a ukulele, passed away in 1996.  Tulips themselves have yet to be affected by the song.  As an extremely popular flower, they can be seen worldwide as a bulbous, colourful plant, particularly famous in the Netherlands. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the Sultan's daughter in the 1992 Disney animated film \"Aladdin\"?", "correct": "Jasmine", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJasmine.\n\n\tPrincess Jasmine, the daughter of Agrabah's bumbling Sultan in \"Aladdin\", is usually sheltered in the palace until she decides to sneak out into the market one day.

She also returned for the second sequel, straight-to-video, \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\".  All three appearances were voiced by Linda Larkin who also returned for the animated TV series.
