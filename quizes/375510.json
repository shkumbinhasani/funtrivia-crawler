One scene from a particular Schwarzenegger film is notorious for not needing a reload. In the scene, the forest is bombarded with machine guns, just in case the titular beast lurks within the trees. Which of these movies contains this scene?", "correct": "Predator", "options": ["The Blob", "Alien", "Thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPredator.\n\n\tIf you have ever counted the shots of any sort of gun used in an action movie, you will discover that quite a number of times, the gun has more bullets in it than that specific type of weapon would normally have; even with an extended magazine. Quite often, the good guy of an action film has plenty of bullets to use on every single bad guy he faces without reloading... that is until he reaches the main villain, where he somehow loses his infinite ammunition ability and has a single bullet left. Granted, films typically do not show characters reloading the gun during a fight because it loses some intensity when the character has to pause to get more ammunition. It's so much more thrilling when the hero either keeps going with extra ammo, or loses all his or her bullets and has to retrieve a new weapon from an unsuspecting guard.\r \"Predator\" (1987) stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, a major leading another group of soldiers to rescue a Cabinet Minister from a helicopter crash. However, they discover that, lurking in the jungle is some sort of advanced alien who is hunting them. The film has been highly scrutinized for its use of the unrealistic infinite ammo. In the film, machine guns are fired at a forest where the Predator may be, but no one with a minigun stops to reload. A gun enthusiast may cringe at this, since a minigun, even with an extended magazine, will not have enough ammunition to shoot the hundreds of bullets that Schwarzenegger did in \"Predator\" without having to reload. \n"}, {"text": "Bad guys in movies are terrible shots, and no matter how many of them there are, the hero usually emerges victorious without a single gunshot wound. In this respect, Han Solo was lucky, since the Stormtroopers from \"Star Wars\" seemed to never be able to hit anything. However, this does not mean Harrison Ford was able to dodge every bullet; in which of these films, featuring Indiana Jones, was the main character actually shot in the left arm?", "correct": "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "options": ["Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", "Temple of Doom", "The Last Crusade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark.\n\n\tHan Solo may have shot first, but Indiana Jones was unlucky enough to get shot. In the first of the major film franchise (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", 1981), Indiana Jones is hired to find the biblical Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. Of course, as a master archaeologist, he finds it, but it may have been better left hidden. In one scene, Jones was shot while in a truck chase, and Marion nursed him back to health in a following scene. It seems a common thing in movies that bad guys are simply bad shots, or that the hero can somehow dodge behind a table faster than a dozen guns can fire multiple bullets towards him.\r Of course, this hasn't stopped some characters, such as Princess Leia and Indiana Jones, from taking the occasional bullet. Some heroes have even actually died from a less-than-fair battle in the movies. \n"}, {"text": "Many people believe that every good action movie has at least one car chase in it. Hardly any car chase ends without a major explosion, and the explosion is often caused by a single bullet being shot at the gas tank. The first film in the \"James Bond\" reboot starring Daniel Craig contains such a scene. Which film is it?", "correct": "Casino Royale", "options": ["Spectre", "Quantum of Solace", "Skyfall"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasino Royale.\n\n\tInterestingly, it has been proven that a bullet (especially one in a pistol used by James Bond) will not explode a gas tank upon impact. In 2011, the Mythbusters tested the theory (for a second time), and they believed that, if the gas tank was completely full and sealed air tight, it is possible but highly unlikely that a tracer round would make the tank explode - but only after gaining enough air friction for the tracer to already catch fire itself, thus igniting the gas tank upon impact.\r Many movies, then, falsify the facts of physics in their portrayal of car chases. While a vehicle may indeed explode in real life, the cause of such explosions are most certainly not single bullets in the gas tank. Of course, this means that James Bond's feat in \"Casino Royale\" (2006) was most certainly not a realistic portrayal.\r We get to see a more innocent Bond in \"Casino Royale\", as this reboot shows us his first 007 mission. In this film, James Bond must prevent a weapons dealer from winning a poker game, but doing so most certainly isn't the end of his mission. \n"}, {"text": "It seems that, any time there is a car chase in an action movie, bad guys die in car crashes constantly, but the good guys can be tossed around endlessly without any harm, save a few scratches and bruises. Some movies are a bit more accurate, however, and important characters have actually died in terrible car crash. In which of these \"The Fast and the Furious\" films did we lose Han to a car \"accident\" and explosion?", "correct": "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift", "options": ["Fast and Furious 6", "Fast Five", "Fast and Furious"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.\n\n\tWhile Han (portrayed by Sung Kang) appeared in all these \"The Fast and the Furious\" films, he died in the third installment of the series, \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\". Though he died in this third installment of the series, he did appear in \"Fast and Furious\", \"Fast Five\", and \"Fast and Furious 6\", the fourth, fifth, and sixth installments, respectively. Of course, this is because \"Tokyo Drift\", while released in 2006 as the third in the series, chronologically takes place after the events of the sixth film. \r\"Tokyo Drift\" follows Sean, an American teen who totals his car in an illegal street race. After moving in with his military dad in Tokyo, he discovers drift racing and gets involved with Japanese Mafia.\r Of course, there are plenty of other main guys who survived numerous car accidents, such as Jason Bourne, James Bond, and Ethan Hunt (\"Mission Impossible\" series). \n"}, {"text": "It is almost Hollywood law that, should a good guy cause an explosion, he or she should not even flinch or look at the explosion caused, and instead walk away from it casually. Of course, this is not very realistic, as an explosion the size of most movie explosions would be large enough to at least push the character forward a bit. Some movie characters, however, are actually affected by certain explosions. In \"The Hunger Games\", Katniss Everdeen explodes a food supply, and is temporarily affected with what condition?", "correct": "Hearing Loss", "options": ["Amnesia", "Gout", "Heart Murmur"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHearing Loss.\n\n\t\"The Hunger Games\" was released in 2012 and starred Jennifer Lawrence as the ever-popular Katniss Everdeen. In the film, Katniss, along with 23 other 'tributes', are placed in a jungle to kill each other until one survivor emerges. While no cars exploded in the film, like so many other action films, there were still explosions.One such explosion, caused by Katniss Everdeen herself (she shot an arrow at a food supply to cause it to explode), actually caused damage to our heroine. The explosion sent her flying back, and caused her to lose her hearing in her left ear before the Capitol could fix the hearing loss for her.This is a drastically different outcome than that of most action movies, such as \"G.I. Joe\" or \"Die Hard\", where the characters simply walk away from the engulfing flames, almost unaware anything is even blowing up. \n"}, {"text": "How long can you hold your breath? Some movie heroes can hold their breath for seemingly inhuman amounts of time, and they are not only underwater in these scenes, but they are usually fighting enemies or performing difficult tasks; which, of course, makes the holding of one's breath all the more strenuous. While their are countless \"impossible underwater scenes\" in movies, one of my favorites takes place in an \"X-Men\" film that stars Kevin Bacon as the main villain. In which \"X-Men\" movie is there a long underwater battle?", "correct": "X-Men: First Class", "options": ["X-Men: Apocalypse", "X-Men: The Last Stand", "X-Men: Days of Future Past"], "explanation": "\n\n\nX-Men: First Class.\n\n\t\"X-Men: First Class\" was released in 2011 and featured Kevin Bacon as the lead antagonist, Sebastian Shaw. Shaw must be stopped by mutants working for the U.S. government before he starts World War III. In the film, the once friends Charles and Erik begin to shift from friends to enemies. In one scene where Shaw's submarine is lifted from the water, a brief underwater scene ensues.Of course, the 45 seconds or so that the characters are holding their breath underwater is not a terribly long time, and if you're like me, you can hold your breath through the entire scene. Remember, though, that they are underwater, which puts added pressure on the lungs, and they are fighting, which, of course, wears you out.Three quarters of a minute is a long time with no air in those conditions! \n"}, {"text": "We as humans can seem to tolerate other human deaths in films, but when a beloved pet dies, we cannot control our sadness. With that in mind, many movies make dogs and cats buck the odds, leaping out of burning buildings unscathed, landing in a lake after a long fall, and the like. However, some movies actually kill off our favorite non-human characters, such as this zombie survival film starring Will Smith. In which film is Smith's character forced to kill his only friend, a German Shepherd named Sam?", "correct": "I Am Legend", "options": ["Dawn of the Dead", "World War Z", "Resident Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Am Legend.\n\n\tIn the 2007 film \"I Am Legend\", Will Smith plays the part of Robert Neville, one of the last survivors of a zombie-like apocalypse created by a cancer cure that killed the majority of the population and mutated most of the remainder. Robert survives in New York City three years after the 2009 incident with only his dog, Sam, as company. Imagine the immense pain Robert (and audiences everywhere) felt when Sam was bitten by another infected dog and had to be killed for Robert's own protection. Eventually, a cure is found within Robert's blood, which he gives to another survivor he meets so she may bring it to a colony of survivors to end the apocalypse.\r On the bright side, most action movies seem to find a way for the wonderful animals to survive against all odds, even when some of the human characters are not so lucky. I guess, in a way, C3PO and R2D2 are like the pets of the galaxy in \"Star Wars\", as they can avoid any death without much difficulty as well. \n"}, {"text": "Our favorite action heroes would never survive an ambush in real life, so in most movies, the bad guys tend to fight our hero one at a time. Not only does a single file battle keep the protagonist alive, it also allows for some wonderful fight scenes. For instance, which of these actors, known for performing all (or most) of his own stunts, is featured in films such as \"Rush Hour\", \"Shanghai Noon\", and \"Kung Fu Panda\" (at least, his voice)?", "correct": "Jackie Chan", "options": ["Bruce Lee", "Lucy Liu", "Chris Rock"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJackie Chan.\n\n\tJackie Chan has performed a large number of stunts over his movie career, and at one point, this even earned him a Guinness World Record for the \"Most Stunts Performed By a Living Actor\". Chan derived his fighting style from the great Bruce Lee, finding ways to mimic it almost perfectly opposite to the master. This means that, while Bruce Lee had long and flowing movements, Jackie Chan creates his moves to be short and choppy. Jackie Chan keeps his arms close to him, nice and tight, since Bruce Lee kept his wide and loose.\r Of course, if you've seen any of Jackie Chan's films, it is rare that any more than one or two bad guys in a group attack at once. How else would he successfully use his surroundings to beat up the entire ambush of characters? \n"}, {"text": "Movies fill us with lies when it comes to hand to hand combat, in many ways. For instance, a good guy can really take a physical beating without being too severely injured, which is quite unlikely in reality. Then, just as you think he's about to give in, he punches a bad guy square in the face and saves the day. One such film stars Robert Downey Jr. as which title character, who punches someone several times simply because they spit on his head?", "correct": "Sherlock Holmes", "options": ["Chaplin", "Iron Man", "Zodiac"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSherlock Holmes.\n\n\tRobert Downey Jr. played the role of \"Sherlock Holmes\" in the 2009 film of the same name. In an early scene, Sherlock Holmes is found fighting a large man who happens to be winning. When Sherlock begins to walk away, the man spits on the back of his head, so, in true Sherlock Holmes style, he turns around, analyzes the fight ahead of time, and then follows through. The result? The man is left with a fractured jaw, three cracked ribs, four broken ribs, a hemorrhaging diaphgram, and the inability to spit again. Sherlock Holmes, however, is not injured from any of the punches he took, nor are his hands hurting in the least. This is interesting because, if you have ever seen a Mixed Martial Arts fight, you will know that a fight can actually leave the hands in a lot of pain, or even broken, afterwards; something you will rarely see happen in the movies!\r In the film, Sherlock Holmes sees a killer put to death, the case seems closed. But the follower of black magic returned from the grave, and Sherlock, along with Dr. Watson and Irene Adler, must stop the evil man before he takes over the world. \n"}, {"text": "Villains in the movies are fans of monologuing. In real life, it is likely that villains never tell their whole plan; otherwise they risk going to jail and whatnot. However, in the movies, a villain will stop the good guy, but instead of just pulling the trigger, they will stand there, pointing the gun at the good guy, telling their entire plan to the hero. Of course, this is done in movies for two reasons: so we as an audience know exactly what is going on, and to give the good guy plenty of time to think of a quick escape to once again save the day.\n\nOne of my favorite monologues by a villain comes from \"The Dark Knight\", where the villain tells, not Batman, but a soon-to-be villain, of his master plan. Which character is known for his \"agent of chaos\" speech?", "correct": "The Joker", "options": ["Two Face", "Ra's al Ghul", "Scarecrow"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Joker.\n\n\tIn the massively successful film \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), the Joker gives his villainous monologue to another villain - Harvey Dent (though he is not quite the villainous Two Face yet). In this now-famous movie monologue, we learn that the Joker doesn't really have a master plan; rather, he prefers to be an \"agent of chaos\". Heath Ledger's performance was incredible, and he captured the pure essence of the Joker in this \"villain gives away his entire plan\" type speech. \n"}]}
