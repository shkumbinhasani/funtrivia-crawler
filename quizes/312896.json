{"id": "312896", "name": "What Do You Mean, the Cat is on Fire? Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "Thematic Animals", "Thematic Cats"], "questions": [{"text": "What do you mean, the cat is a liar?\n\nThe Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice and Wonderland\" was known for which of these distinguishing characteristics?", "correct": "Wide grin", "options": ["Thick whiskers", "Twitchy ears", "Glowing nose"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWide grin.\n\n\tCharacteristic of being sly and untrustworthy, the Cheshire Cat was a striped kitty who plagued Alice (of Wonderland) with a number of different problems in the novel (and the film).  Even more perplexing is the fact that this feline would often smile with a wide grin, even causing itself to disappear (yet still, people would see the smile floating independent of the body).  In the Disney film, the Cheshire Cat is striped pink and purple and continues in the same characteristic way. Of course, its appearance in the film is one of the most well-known of all characters due to his obscure nature and eclectic demeanor. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat is haywire?\n\nWhat is the name of the minty plant known for its effect on cats?", "correct": "Catnip & Catmint", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCatnip & Catmint.\n\n\tKnown under the genus Nepeta, Catnip is a plant which can be grown in gardens or in the wild.  Found in many different places around the world, this plant is often grown and packaged to be sold in pet stores, both as shredded versions of the plant itself and within cat toys.  Nonetheless, cats go wild for the stuff.  Breaking the buds of one of the flowers of this plant will release pheromones which will evoke different responses in different cats with many typically turning playful.  Some cats, however, will not react at all- it all depends on your feline genes. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat has expired?\n\nIn which one of these movies, each containing a cat, did the featured feline survive?", "correct": "Meet the Parents", "options": ["National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", "Drag Me To Hell", "The Grudge"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMeet the Parents.\n\n\tSome people just don't like cats I guess.\r\"Drag Me To Hell\", a 2009 horror film directed by Sam Raimi, featured a cat in the possession of Alison Lohman's ill-fated character.  She ends up sacrificing the poor kitty in a desperate attempt to save her own life from the mythological lamia who has been cast upon her.  Similarly, Sam Raimi produced the American remake of \"The Grudge\".  In this film, the cat is tied into the curse and many of the characters come across this and a spooky little kid who meows before he strikes.  Chevy Chase's \"Christmas Vacation\", another popular \"National Lampoon\" title starring the ever-tragic Griswold family, features a cat accidentally packaged in a Christmas gift which arrives with the senile Aunt Bethany (who also packaged her gelatin dish in a similar box).  The cat soon finds its way to the Christmas tree lights and explodes when it short circuits one of the wires, destroying one piece of the family's living room set.\rIn \"Meet the Parents\", the Ben Stiller/Robert De Niro comedy, the main cat is more than intelligent enough to care for itself.  Despite numerous horrible encounters Stiller's character has with the cat, it survives to the end of both this film and its sequel, \"Meet the Fockers\". \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat has inspired?\n\nWhich famous author wrote a short story called \"The Black Cat\"?", "correct": "Edgar Allan Poe", "options": ["Mark Twain", "Ernest Hemingway", "Charles Dickens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdgar Allan Poe.\n\n\tThis Gothic short story about a man who inevitably kills his cat after a fit of alcoholic rage is indeed a dark one.  Clearly, the superstitious thoughts about black cats persist through the story because the man's house burns down.  Soon though, the cat continues to plague the poor protagonist and his life falls into shambles as a result of what he's done to the poor feline.  In the story, the cat's name is Pluto.\r\"The Black Cat\" was later adapted by Stuart Gordon for the TV anthology \"Masters of Horror\" in its second season.  The story is often regarded as similar to Poe's other, more famous work, \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in terms of its narrative. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat has perspired?\n\nCan cats sweat?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tCats don't necessarily get sweaty like we do and clearly there isn't a stick of deodorant to rub along your cat, but they do contain sweat glands in the pads of their paws.  Like dogs, cats are able to pant, but typically, you won't see them doing so.  Instead, what may simply be regarded as a simple cleaning, during which the cat licks its paws and fur, is intended to keep them refreshed during hot days.  Of course, make sure your pets are drinking water. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat is admired?\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, it is well known that cats were oft regarded as revered creatures.  Which of these Egyptian Gods had the head of a cat?", "correct": "Bastet", "options": ["Anubis", "Horus", "Isis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBastet.\n\n\tIn Ancient Egypt, cats were revered due to the fact that they were able to eliminate rats and other rodents that plagued the country.  Many cats, however, were wild as opposed to domesticated though this was one of the earlier times during which cats were, in fact, kept as pets.\rBastet is one of many figures used in Egyptian mythology to represent fertility in addition to being another figure of the sun.  Depicted with the head of a lion, her image was reflected upon many supporters in Lower Egypt and she became the patron God of cats.  As a result, those who visited her temple were often there to place their mummified felines. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat is named Quagmire?\n\nIn which TV show can the animated character 'Quagmire' (who once owned a cat) be found?", "correct": "Family Guy", "options": ["The Simpsons", "King of the Hill", "Futurama"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFamily Guy.\n\n\tQuagmire is one of the neighbours and best friends of Peter Griffin, the show's popular protagonist.  Known for his womanizing antics and his obscure catchphrase (\"giggety-giggety-goo\"), he is often regarded as one of the more famous faces on the show though he isn't often featured as a major character in his episodes.\rIn one episode in season six, however, Quagmire ends up adopting a cat.  When his friends soon realize that he finds more of a friendship in his cat than with them, they end up accidentally killing it.  This plot, however, is soon forgotten as the episode (aptly named \"420\") soon delves into the topic of marijuana legalization.  In the end, Peter bluntly breaks the news to his friend and slams the door in his face.\rOn one occasion, the Griffins did own a cat, but were frightened when its horribly dangerous antics put the family in harm's way. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat is your desire?\n\nIn perhaps one of the oddest movies ever, what is the name of the world's first X-rated animated cat?", "correct": "Fritz", "options": ["Rusty", "Crumb", "Snowy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFritz.\n\n\tReleased in 1972, \"Fritz the Cat\" was based on a humorous comic series created by Robert Crumb (known for \"Zap Comix\").  When the film was released, it received both praise and critically negative response from various different people due to its mature content.  In several instances, Fritz is in sexual situations with various other cats.\rThe film's sequel, released two years later, was known as \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\".  Becoming the first animated film to premiere at Cannes, this film only achieved an R rating, one step down from its predecessor. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat met a vampire?\n\nIn what children's story regarding both a cat named Chester and a dog named Harold, was about a rather obscure vampire?", "correct": "Bunnicula", "options": ["The Timid Vampire", "Howliday Inn", "Quackula"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBunnicula.\n\n\tCreated by James and Deborah Howe, \"Bunnicula\" was written in 1979 and followed the narrative of a family dog, Harold, and the events that followed the arrival of a new family pet, a rabbit named Bunnicula.  Found in a movie theater (where \"Dracula\" was playing), the youngest member of the family brought him home.  In the following days, the family would awaken to find vegetables on the floor of the house, drained of all juices and stark white.  Chester, the family cat, goes on a mission to unravel the mystery of this supposed vampire rabbit before he starts getting a taste for blood rather than the nutrients of innocent, harmless vegetables.\rThe book was the first in a series of many revolving around the same animals (including \"Howliday Inn\").  \"The Celery Stalks at Midnight\" follows up on the original story although it's the third in terms of release date. \n"}, {"text": "What do you mean, the cat should retire?\n\nWhich cat should probably quit his day job on the 'Nostromo'?", "correct": "Jones", "options": ["Tiger", "Whiskers", "Snitch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJones.\n\n\tJones the cat was the orange tabby featured in \"Alien\" and \"Aliens\", both starring Sigourney Weaver in the leading role as Ellen Ripley.  \"Alien\", the first in the famous horror/sci-fi series, featured Jones as one of the only surviving characters.  Although the alien typically showed no care for the small feline, it is clearly evident through all the steam, darkness, and dank interior shots of the ship that Jones the cat was never a big fan of xenomorphic aliens.  Before hopping into the Nostromo's emergency shuttle, Ripley puts the cat into a carrier and starts the self-destruct sequence, and before falling into a deep cryo-sleep, she ensures that the cat too gets a comfy rest.\rJones later appears in the opening of \"Aliens\", the sequel, alive and well. \n"}]}
