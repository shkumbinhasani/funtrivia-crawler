She believed he wanted her to end all acquaintance with her father's friends because of snobbery. After all he was in the wine business and not in common trade. However, his motives were more selfish than that. He simply wanted to ensure she had no chance of marriage for that would mean the loss of a considerable sum to him. She had inherited money from an uncle in New Zealand, and he had the use of the interest as long as she was single and staying with her mother and him. \n"}, {"text": "In \"A Case of Identity\" what was significant about all the letters sent by Hosmer Angel to Mary Sutherland?", "correct": "They were all typewritten even down to the signature", "options": ["They were all especially scented note-paper", "They were in two distinctly different sets of handwriting", "They were all posted in Camberwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were all typewritten even down to the signature.\n\n\tHosmer Angel was Mr. Windibank in disguise and his handwriting might have been known to his step-daughter.

Conan Doyle cleverly builds up the atmosphere by contrasting the snugness of the flat in Baker Street with the wildness of the weather outside. Now, with the details of his case, Mr. Openshaw is about to bring some of the wildness inside. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Five Orange Pips\" which initials were scrawled on the letter which contained the five orange pips?", "correct": "K.K.K.", "options": ["J.M.", "V.V.", "S.H."], "explanation": "\n\n\nK.K.K.\n\n\tK.K.K. stood for Ku Klux Klan. Holmes says that this name originally arose from its supposed resemblance to the sound of a man cocking a rifle. V.V. are initials used in \"The Valley of Fear\" for the Vermissa Valley where the infamous Scowrers carried on a reign of fear. S.H. could stand for Sherlock Holmes and J.M. for James Moriarty. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Five Orange Pips\" what did Holmes find in common between the cities of Pondicherry, Dundee and London from where the three letters had been sent?", "correct": "They were all sea-ports", "options": ["They were all cities where Moriarty had committed crimes", "They were all on major railway routes", "The dead man, Mr. Openshaw, had lived in them all"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey were all sea-ports.\n\n\tHolmes worked out that in each case the writer of the letter had been on board a ship.

Watson remarks that the gales in the Atlantic were very severe that year. All that was found of the ship was a shattered sternpost with the letters \"L.S.\" carved on it. The story began with a storm and now Conan Doyle has neatly brought it to a conclusion with another one. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" where did Neville St. Clair carry out his transformation into a disabled beggar?", "correct": "In an opium den", "options": ["In a small variety theatre", "In a small barge moored on the Thames", "In a working man's hostel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn an opium den.\n\n\tThe opium den was in Upper Swandam Lane on the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.

The more deformed and repulsive he appeared, the more likely the public was to give money. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Blue Carbuncle\" in what unusual place did Peterson, the commissionaire, and his wife find the precious jewel?", "correct": "In the crop of a goose", "options": ["In the beak of a parrot", "In the crop of a turkey", "In the crop of a chicken"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the crop of a goose.\n\n\tThe goose had been dropped on the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Goodge Street by a man who had also left his hat behind.

So he told the man he was sure that the geese were country bred ones. The man disproved this by showing him the address that proved that they were town bred ones. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Speckled Band\" how does Dr. Grimesby Roylott demonstrate his strength to Holmes and Watson?", "correct": "He twists a poker out of shape", "options": ["He lifts the door of their flat in Baker Street off its hinges", "He twists one of the railings outside their flat until it snaps", "He lifts the body of his carriage whilst a wheel is replaced"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe twists a poker out of shape.\n\n\tAfter he has twisted the poker out of shape he hurls it into the fireplace. \"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he declares.

The whistle was obviously used to lure the snake back to Dr. Roylott's bedroom. The hissing noise was the sound of the snake itself. On the last occasion the terrible cry was given by Dr. Roylott as the snake attacked him after Holmes had driven it back through the ventilation grating with his stick. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Engineer's Thumb\" what did Colonel Lysander Stark declare was the purpose of his stamping machine?", "correct": "It was used to compress fuller's earth into bricks", "options": ["It was used to crush the resin out of pine bark to make turpentine", "It was used to make the metal tongues of garden forks", "It was used to make the clay moulds for pottery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt was used to compress fuller's earth into bricks.\n\n\tIn fact the hydraulic machine was used as part of the coining process in the manufacture of counterfeit coins. The secrecy that Stark claimed was necessary so he could acquire more deposits of fuller's earth on the adjacent land was in fact so that the coiners could avoid the interest of the law. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Engineer's Thumb\" what clue did Holmes use to deduce that the mysterious house was not north, south, east or west of the village of Eyford in Berkshire?", "correct": "The fact that Stark's carriage horse was not sweating", "options": ["The smell of the woodsmoke from a nearby foundry", "The fact that Mr. Hatherley could hear the sound of a train", "The tracks left by the carriage in the mud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe fact that Stark's carriage horse was not sweating.\n\n\tMr. Hatherley was under the impression that he and Stark had travelled possibly ten miles away from the station at Eyford. From the description of the fresh horse that met Hatherley at the station Holmes knew it must have come from the centre of town and could not possibly have travelled the ten miles. Stark had merely driven five miles out and five miles back again to deceive Hatherley. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Noble Bachelor\" in which Californian city did Lord St. Simon first meet the lady to whom he became engaged?", "correct": "San Francisco", "options": ["Los Angeles", "Sacramento", "San Diego"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSan Francisco.\n\n\tThe whole case depends upon the fact that Lord St. Simon's \"bride\" had previously been married and thus was not really married to him.

However, Rucastle survives but was a broken man, \"kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife\". \n"}]}
