This was Galen, who served for a time as the court physician to which of these ancient Roman emperors?  \n", "correct": "Commodus", "options": ["Augustus", "Constantine", "Trajan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCommodus.\n\n\tGalen lived from around 130 to 200 AD, and worked as physician to the emperor Commodus, and also to the gladiators in Rome.  Prior to his work with Commodus he had been befriended by Commodus' father Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher emperor.  There are many errors in Galen's work, but his writings became the standard for Western medicine for centuries, until they were finally superseded by the work of Harvey, Vesalius and others.  It must be noted that Galen was responsible for some very important anatomical observations, and his accomplishments should not be overshadowed by his failures. \n"}, {"text": "An Italian astronomer and physicist, Galileo Galilei was one of the founders of modern science.  Born in 1564, he first came to public attention with the invention of which device in 1586?  \n", "correct": "Hydrostatic balance", "options": ["Water clock", "Mercury Thermometer", "Refracting telescope"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHydrostatic balance.\n\n\tWorking off of the ideas of Archimedes, the 22-year old Galileo wrote a short tract called 'La Bilancetta' (The Little Balance) in which he described his clever new invention.  Two years later he became a professor at the University of Pisa, and began his legendary work on the motion of falling bodies.  The gravity of his work cannot be understated...(ugh, awful pun!) \n"}, {"text": "This Dutch jurist is considered to be the father of international law...name him!  \n", "correct": "Hugo Grotius", "options": ["George Grosz", "Wilhelm Gropper", "Walter Gropius"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHugo Grotius.\n\n\tGrotius wrote the famous treatise 'On the Law of War and Peace' in 1625, laying down the rules of conduct applying to nation to nation interaction, while serving a life sentence in jail!  This is perhaps the most productive jail time ever spent, wouldn't you agree? \n"}, {"text": "Maybe the most significant pope named Gregory was this one, whose real name was 'Hildebrand'.  Which number Gregory was Hildebrand?  \n", "correct": "Gregory VII", "options": ["Gregory XIII", "Gregory I", "Gregory III"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGregory VII.\n\n\tHildebrand became Gregory VII in 1073, and served 12 productive years in that post.  His stint as pope included a number of reforms, including an attempt to rein in church corruption.  During his period as pope he often came into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, and was even forced to flee to Ravenna for a time in 1084 when Henry seized Rome. \n"}, {"text": "Though many people have never heard of him, this man may have had a legitimate claim to the invention of the telephone.  Who was this rival of Alexander Graham Bell?  \n", "correct": "Elisha Gray", "options": ["Adolphus Greely", "Josiah Gregg", "William Green"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElisha Gray.\n\n\tElisha Gray, who lived from 1835-1901, was a significant rival to Bell.  Apparently, Bell and Gray simultaneously invented the telephone, but Bell beat Gray to the patent office, leading to a legal battle.  Bell won the court case, leaving Gray's name on permanent hold in the history books.  Some, including myself, believe he should get much more credit for his work than has been afforded him... \n"}, {"text": "Two Roman brothers attempted to reform the Roman republic a little over 100 years before its fall.  What was the surname of these two brothers, Tiberius Sempronius and Gaius Sempronius?  \n", "correct": "Gracchus", "options": ["Galatius", "Germanicus", "Galba"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGracchus.\n\n\tThe brothers Gracchi attempted to undermine the immense power of the rich patricians in the senate by making public redistributions of land among other reforms.  Both brothers Gracchi were killed for their efforts, but their goal of undermining the wealthy senate ultimately achieved fruit.  Unfortunately, the senate-dominated republic was replaced by an even less democratic system, that of imperial Rome. \n"}, {"text": "Mohandas K. Gandhi, aka Mahatma, was the revered father of modern India.  What was the title of his non-violent program of civil disobedience?  \n", "correct": "Satyagraha", "options": ["Ahimsa", "Vamana", "Brahmacharya"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSatyagraha.\n\n\tGandhi's 'satyagraha' movement was strongly influenced by the writings of Thoreau, who preached the doctrine of civil disobedience.

What color shirts did his followers wear?  \n", "correct": "Red", "options": ["Brown", "Black", "Blue"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRed.\n\n\tGaribaldi was a brilliant military campaigner, leading his Red Shirts against Austria in the late 1850s, early 1860s.

Ironically, George's diary notation for July 4, 1776 states that 'nothing of significance' happened that day.  Of course, he was unable to know what was fomenting among his disloyal subjects in the American colonies! \n"}, {"text": "Not only is this man considered the 'father of the science of magnetism', he also served as personal physician to Queen Elizabeth I.  What was his name?  \n", "correct": "William Gilbert", "options": ["Josiah Gibbs", "Charles Gibson", "Alfred Gilman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWilliam Gilbert.\n\n\tGilbert, who lived from 1544 to 1603, served as the personal physician to Queen Elizabeth for quite a number of years.
