{"id": "394670", "name": "\"Could It Be... Satan?\" Multiple Choice Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Apocalypse"], "questions": [{"text": "How many husbands does Ms. Mead admit to having killed?", "correct": "Three & 3", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree & 3.\n\n\tMichael talks to Ms. Mead, giving her insight into why he gave her his former guardian's form and thoughts.  A supporter of the dark lord, she raised him in his teenage years, giving him confidence with her evil ways.  She explained to him, at one point, that she killed her first three husbands.  When the truth is laid out, Ms. Mead finally feels as though she has a place in the world, and it's by his side as he attempt to rebuild the world.  As she helps him don a clean jacket, however, Langdon feels a strong presence and energy in Outpost Three. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia admits that the women she brought back from the dead were affected by which of these?", "correct": "An identity spell", "options": ["Shapeshifting magic", "A hex", "Voodoo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAn identity spell.\n\n\tIt turns out that the presence Michael felt was none other than a witch coven led by Cordelia Goode and her followers as they entered Outpost Three and resurrected their sisters, Mallory, Dinah, and Coco.  Myrtle Snow, standing to the side, laments that they had to heal them and free them from an identity spell all in the same moment, but that doesn't seem to be on the others' minds. Coco angrily paces the room, irate with Brock for stabbing her in the head.  Dinah refuses to go along with any plans since her methods have served her well enough in life.  Nonetheless, Cordelia informs the women that they have been protected all this time, and now they must work together to stop an evil force. Said force stands at the top of the stairs, however, watching and anticipating their attempts to fix things. \n"}, {"text": "Who of these was initially against Michael Langdon's training as a warlock?", "correct": "John Henry Moore", "options": ["Ariel Augustus", "Baldwin", "Mr. Chablis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Henry Moore.\n\n\tThree years before the bomb, Outpost Three was an academy for boys, but what many wouldn't know is that it was used to train young warlocks.  As a young Mr. Banks arrived in class late for an incantation, his instructor, Mr. Chablis, was called to the main office to meet with John Henry Moore, who previously quit, and their Grand Chancellor, Ariel. The matter at hand was a video they were sent from the Los Angeles Police wherein Michael Langdon, taken in for questioning, was present as an interrogator was gruesomely killed, as though possessed at the time.  While Moore was very hesitant to let Langdon into the academy, Ariel believed that he could be the alpha prophecized to lead them, and if he completed the Seven Wonders, they could surpass the witches in the hierarchy. \n"}, {"text": "Michael was sent to jail for allegedly killing who of these?", "correct": "A butcher", "options": ["A child", "A teacher", "A police officer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA butcher.\n\n\tAriel visited Michael Langdon in L.A. County Jail and proposed that he may be a warlock, saying that the powers he'd exhibited were merely untapped potential.  Although it appeared his powers killed the interrogator, he was also placed into jail for trying to protect Ms. Mead who, at the butcher's, demanded a goat's head for her incantation and was refused service. When the butcher insulted Ms. Mead, Michael went into a trance, awakening only when five knives were plunged into the man behind the counter.  Ariel freed Michael from his cell soon after and they departed, leaving Ms. Mead behind, chanting outside the station to support her boy. \n"}, {"text": "Hawthorne Academy was built under which of these?", "correct": "A statue", "options": ["The sea", "A former military base", "A cemetery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA statue.\n\n\tAriel brought Michael straight to the Hawthorne Academy after freeing him from jail.  As Ariel sated, in 2014, Cordelia Goode outed the warlocks as an institution and locals, averse to having magic-users in the area, set fire to the original establishment built there, sending the warlocks underground.  They built Hawthorne under the old statue in the garden.  When they descended into the academy, Michael was greeted by the other students and quickly inducted into the ranks of the warlocks learning there.  Within a month, he was already successful enough to warrant standardized testing. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was not a test that Michael performed after his first month of studies at Hawthorne Academy?", "correct": "Resurrection", "options": ["Weather changing", "Scrying", "Teleportation"], "explanation": "\n\n\nResurrection.\n\n\tAfter his first month of studies, Michael was brought before the warlock instructors to be ranked on his strength as a warlock via testing which, normally, would be done after his first year.  Most of the students were level 1 and the instructors were level 3.  A level 4, as they stated, would be on par with the witch Supreme, Cordelia Goode. They tested him in scrying, teleportation, and the ability to change the weather.  He passed all three with flying colours.  While most of his instructors were thrilled, Mr. Moore believed that the boy's tendency to not follow directions could be a problem.  Either way, he was the most powerful warlock they'd ever seen. \n"}, {"text": "Mallory's ancestry was said to track back to which of these?", "correct": "Salem", "options": ["Haiti", "Bavaria", "Romania"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalem.\n\n\tThe warlock instructors discussed their fortunes in finding Michael when they did as their new acquisition could surely gain them status in the magical world.  Nonetheless, Moore worried about Langdon's malevolence.  Ariel wouldn't have dissent though, and they all had to raise a toast to their coming success.\rIn New Orleans, Miss Robichaux's Academy took in a new class of witches at the same time.  During a class about immutable objects led by Zoe Benson, she and Cordelia watched as a young, new witch, Mallory, transformed the colour of a rose from white to blue before its petals fell off and became butterflies.  Zoe later told the Supreme that Mallory's family was said to date back to the times of Salem. \n"}, {"text": "Cordelia was unable to save Queenie from the Hotel Cortez.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tAfter news from Myrtle, Cordelia and some of her top witches were told to take a plane and travel out to the Hawthorne Academy for a council meeting of the utmost importance.    The three of them were welcomed in and Ariel cut to the chase about their excitement and revealed their own Michael Langdon, stating that his powers rose to that of the Supreme's in strength. Cordelia, Myrtle, and Zoe didn't really believe this though, since testosterone greatly inhibited magical ability, and Cordelia outright refused to give the boy the test of the Seven Wonders to avoid condemning him to death.  She cited Misty Day as a cautionary tale in this instance, but the warlocks deemed Cordelia to be cold and uncaring since she never brought Queenie back from Los Angeles and the Hotel Cortez. \n"}, {"text": "In the Hotel Cortez, Queenie spent her time playing cards with which spirit?", "correct": "Mr. March", "options": ["Hazel Evers", "John Lowe", "Will Drake"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMr. March\n\n\tThe truth was, Cordelia did go to Los Angeles to reclaim her from the evil Hotel Cortez but it wasn't possible as the structure seemed to be a Hellmouth operated by Satan himself.  No matter which door or window Cordelia and Queenie tried to use, she couldn't be pulled from the building.  They tried for days before Queenie insisted Cordelia return to the coven.  It was, as Cordelia said, her greatest failure as Supreme.  She continued to refuse though, deciding her decision was final.\rIn his room, Michael Langdon scried during this meeting, seeing the Hotel Cortez through his gaze.  He arrived there on his own, finding Queenie playing cards with James March.  Langdon told her that he had arrived to do what her Supreme could not, and at March's insistence, she joined him and left the Hotel.  There was still work for Langdon to do though. \n"}, {"text": "Where was Madison's personal Hell?", "correct": "A department store", "options": ["A prison cell", "A movie set", "A fast food joint"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA department store.\n\n\tTrapped in her own personal Hell, Madison Montgomery found herself working in a department store, clearly forgotten for her famous past and damned to restock the shelves and deal with retail customers.  When Michael Langdon found her, she was folding towels.  Sure enough, with his powers, he was able to bring her back.\rAnd Cordelia knew immediately, as both of the witches' life-forces reentered the mortal coil and she felt their presences.  On their way out of Hawthorne Academy, the witches passed by the warlocks in the main hall.  When they took the elevator back to the surface, to their shock, they found themselves face to face with Queenie, Madison, and Langdon.  In shock, Cordelia fainted. \n"}]}
