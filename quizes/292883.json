{"id": "292883", "name": "From World History Quiz | History | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "History Trivia", " World History"], "questions": [{"text": "Which of these U.S. Presidents lived the longest after leaving office?", "correct": "Herbert Hoover", "options": ["Thomas Jefferson", "John Quincy Adams", "Richard Nixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHerbert Hoover.\n\n\tHerbert Hoover, the 31st US President, lost the 1932 election to Franklin D Roosevelt and left office in March 1933 at the age of 58. Unlike many other holders of the office, the majority of whom died within a decade of leaving office, Hoover lived for more than another 31 years before his death in October 1964. His death left Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower as the only living former Presidents.\rHoover was elected in a relative landslide in 1928, taking 40 of the 48 states and more than 58% of the vote against his Democtat opponent, Al Smith. His Presidency soon ran into trouble, though, with the stock market crash of October 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. He also had to contend with growing public opposition to Prohibition, and the 1932 election saw him win only 6 states and less than 40% of the votes as F.D.R swept to the first of his record four victories at the ballotbox.\rThe other three options above all survived for a relatively long period after leaving office -- Jefferson for 17 years, Adams for nearly 19 years, and Nixon for nearly 20 years. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the 18th century, 80% of slaves traded by Britain came through which port?", "correct": "Liverpool", "options": ["Southampton", "Bristol", "London"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLiverpool.\n\n\tLiverpool has a turbulent history ... Founded by King John in 1207, it still had a population of fewer than 500 more than four centuries later. Its first slave ship, the 'Liverpool Merchant' sailed for Africa in 1699, and suddenly business boomed -- the port's first commercial wet dock was built in 1715. Between about 1790 and the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 Liverpool controlled 80% of Britain's and more than 40% of Europe's slave trade. A century later, more than 40% of the entire world's trade passed through the port. By the time of the 1931 census, the city's population had mushroomed to more than 850,000. By 1961 that number had declined to little more than 610,000 and by the 2001 census it was under 440,000.\r2007 saw the city's 800th anniversary and it was named as 'European City of Culture' for 2008. \n"}, {"text": "Born Amy Hart in Cheshire, England, the daughter of a blacksmith, she moved to London where she worked as a maid, an actress, a prostitute, a striptease artiste and a model to numerous painters. It is as the mistress of a public figure that she is rememebered, though -- who was he?", "correct": "Admiral Horatio Nelson", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "King Louis XV of France", "King Charles II of England"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAdmiral Horatio Nelson.\n\n\tAll four men are associated with a woman -- Shakespeare with Anne Hathaway, Charles II with Nell Gwynn, Louix XV with Madame Pompadour, and Lord Nelson with Lady Emma Hamilton.\rAmy Hart changed her christian name to Emma when she moved to London. It was while working at 'Madame Kelly's', an exclusive brothel, that Emma met and began a liason with Charles Greville, an MP and the second son to the Earl of Warwick. Tiring of her, Greville persuaded his wealthy uncle to take her off his hands, and so she was sent to Naples, where Sir William Hamilton was the British envoy. To Greville's surprise, the next thing he heard was that the two were to be married. \rAs the wife of the British envoy, Lady Hamilton met with Nelson when he stopped to gather reinforcements. When he returned, a living legend after his victory in the 'Battle of the Nile', but in very poor health, it was Lady Hamilton who nursed him. The rest, as they say, is history. \n"}, {"text": "What was Gandhi's first name?", "correct": "Mohandas", "options": ["Nehru", "Mahatma", "Karamchand"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMohandas.\n\n\tHis full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Widely known as Mahatma Gandhi, 'mah\u00e2tm\u00e2' is an honorific title meaning 'Great Soul'. His birthday, October 2, is a national holiday in India, and in 2007 the United Nations passed a resolution declaring that date as 'The International Day of Non-Violence'. \"Time Magazine's\" 'Man of the Year' in 1930, he was also the runner-up to Albert Einstein in the 'Man of the Century' announced in 1999. \n"}, {"text": "Which company bought Bentley Motors in 1998?", "correct": "Volkswagen", "options": ["Ford", "Honda", "Audi"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVolkswagen.\n\n\tFounded by Walter Owen Bentley in 1919, the company produced its first cars in September 1921. Unfortunately, a company specializing in luxury cars was not what the world needed most in the Great Depression of the late 1920s, and it was sold to Rolls Royce in 1931 with the new version Bentley appearing in 1933. \n"}, {"text": "Who was the British monarch during William Pitt the Younger's two spells as Prime Minister?", "correct": "George III", "options": ["William IV", "George IV", "Victoria"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGeorge III.\n\n\tAlthough he died relatively young, Pitt lived a full life, with almost half of his 46 years spent as the British Prime Minister. In 1783, aged only 24, he became the youngest person ever to hold the country's top political office, a post vacated by his father just 15 years earlier.\rIn 1798, whilst still PM, Pitt fought a duel on Putney Heath with a rival politician, George Tierney, although neither combatant was injured.\rWith the French Revolution stirring up religious and political tensions in Ireland, Pitt saw a union as the only solution, and the 1800 'Act of Union' that established 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' was Pitt's last major contribution in his 18-year tenure as Prime Minister. The following year, in February 1801, he resigned in a dispute with King George III over granting political concessions to Ireland's cathloic majority.\rPitt returned to the top job in 1804, but his second term was to be much shorter than his first, although times were hardly quiet, with Napoleon in charge just across the Channel. Nelson's victory at The Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 ensured Britain naval dominance but there were defeats too. Whether due to the pressure of war or to his fondness for fine port, Pitt died of liver disease in January 1806. \n"}, {"text": "What relation is King Harald V of Norway to King Edward VII of Great Britain?", "correct": "Great grandson", "options": ["Cousin", "They are not related", "Great nephew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat grandson.\n\n\tThe current incarnation of Norway's monarchy dates back only to independence in 1905, so when Harald was born in 1937 he was the fist Norwegian-born prince for more than 550 years. He became King Harald V upon the death of his father, King Olav V, in 1991. \rA second cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, Harald is 61 places behind Prince Charles in the line of succession to the British throne. His father was the son of Princess Maud, the youngest daughter of King Edward VII (reigned 1901-1910) and Queen Alexandra. Edward VII is most notable as the only British monarch to die as a member of the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He also waited longer than any previous 'heir apparent' to become the English or British monarch. \n"}, {"text": "In which year did Roald Amundsen's party become the first to reach the South Pole?", "correct": "1911", "options": ["1913", "1898", "1905"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1911.\n\n\tAmundsen is best remembered as the leader of the Norwegian team that won the race to reach the South Pole, beating the ill-fated British party led by Robert Scott by just five weeks.\rAmundsen was also the first person to reach both Poles and the first person known to travel through the Northwest Passage across the Arctic Ocean to the north of Canada.\rCuriously, Amundsen was not originally intending to go to the South Pole at all. He was, in fact, planning to go to the North Pole, which was still unclaimed at that time. But, on hearing that Robert Peary had captured that prize, Amundsen elected to head south. He left Oslo in June 1910, arriving in Antarctica the following January. The team of five with 16 dogs finally arrived at the South Pole on December 14, 1911. \n"}, {"text": "What destroyed 'The Hanging Gardens of Babylon', 'The Colossus of Rhodes' and 'The Lighthouse at Alexandria'?", "correct": "Earthquake", "options": ["Fire", "Flood", "Tourists"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEarthquake.\n\n\tAlthough you can find plenty of references to them, no one ever took a trip to see 'The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World'. Each one existed, of course, but some were destroyed before others were even built.\r'The Colossus of Rhodes' was a 110-foot tall bronze state of the Greek Sun god, Helios. By far the shortest-lived of the seven, it was built in the early part of the 3rd century BC and destroyed by an earthquake about 65 years later, in 226 BC (although the scrap was not removed until almost 900 years later.\r'The Lighthouse at Alexandria' was built around the same time as the Colossus, and it is estimated that it stood more than 400-feet tall and for many centuries was the tallest man-made structure on Earth. With the exception of the Pyramid, which is still standing today, this one lasted longer than any of the others -- it was destroyed by an earthquake sometime in the 14th or 15th century.\r'The Hanging Gardens of Babylon' were reputedly built in the early part of the 6th-Century BC by King Nebuchadnezzer II for his wife, although there is some doubt whether they were an actual or a poetic creation. Once again, earthquake destroyed whatever may have once existed some 600-700 years later. \n"}, {"text": "Since 1700, the Spanish monarchy has come from which royal house?", "correct": "Bourbon/Borb\u00f3n", "options": ["Nassau", "Braganza", "Valois"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBourbon/Borb\u00f3n.\n\n\tThe reigning houses in both Spain and Luxembourg come from the Bourbon branch of the Capetian dynasty. The line goes back as far as the 16th century, at which time the house ruled Navarre and France, although their control in the latter came to an abrupt conclusion at the bottom of a guillotine basket during the French Revolution. \rThey have been more successful in Spain, where the Bourbon line was established in 1700 when Philip V became King. (In Spain it is spelled Borb\u00f3n.) Even here, though, they have been overthrown and restored several times, reigning 1700-1808, 1813-1868, 1875-1931 and since 1975. \n"}]}
