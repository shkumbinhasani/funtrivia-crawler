{"id": "406721", "name": "\"Winter Kills\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Double Feature"], "questions": [{"text": "Whose body is found by a fishing boat in Provincetown's bay?", "correct": "Chief Burelson's", "options": ["Karen's", "Doris'", "Mickey's"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChief Burelson's.\n\n\tAs a fishing boat leaves Provincetown to start work for the day, it appears as though they've collided with something out in the water.  The captain checks what might have snagged in the propellor to find the body of Provincetown's police chief stuck in the blades, waterlogged, having been dumped into the ocean after Alma killed her.\r Provincetown's city council meets to deal with the banalities of local concerns and it's there that Holden Vaughn exercises the little power he has over his hometown.  Trooper Remy of the Massachusetts police steps forward at this time to start the investigation into Chief Burelson's death.  Holden has no choice but to comply with what she needs. \n"}, {"text": "Provincetown City Council chalks the murders up to which of these things?", "correct": "Wintertime problems", "options": ["Addiction issues", "Cabin fever", "Bad eggs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWintertime problems.\n\n\tTrooper Remy makes Provincetown City Council aware of the situation at hand in that Chief Burelson was investigating the recent spate of murders on the cape, all of which featured victims whose throats were slashed with vicious, uneven wounds and the draining of most of their blood.  Burelson's body featured the same wound pattern. The council makes light of the situation by chalking these murders up to wintertime problems.  Strange things happen on Cape Cod every winter and every year citizens chalk it up to living somewhere quite unusual.  By the time spring rolls around, it'll all come to an end. If word gets out, they might scare away the summer tourists, and that'll ruin their livelihoods.  When Remy leaves, Holden suggests he'll take care of the problem. \n"}, {"text": "Holden Vaughn reaches out to Belle and Austin about the issue in town and warns them that if they don't fix things, he'll do which of the following?", "correct": "Declare their houses historical landmarks", "options": ["Run them out with protests", "Expose their lies", "Have them removed by force"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDeclare their houses historical landmarks.\n\n\tHolden Vaughn heads to Belle's house, inviting Austin and the Chemist along for a discussion of what to do next.  In his opinion, the pill addicts are part of the natural symbiosis of the cape; in the summer all involved recede from the cape and in the winter, nobody important is fed upon.  But this winter has gotten too messy and chaotic, and if they don't put an end to the problem then he'll be having their homes declared Historical Sites and complicating their lives in Provincetown. When Holden departs, the Chemist forces the two writers to act, much like she did days before.  If they don't dispose of the Gardners, things will change. \n"}, {"text": "Who announces that they plan to ween themselves of the pill?", "correct": "Harry", "options": ["Belle", "Alma", "Austin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry.\n\n\tAt the Gardner household, Ursula reads over Harry's latest screenplay and lets him know that she believes it to be his masterpiece; he may never write something to top its quality.  This is why he makes the announcement that with spring coming, they're done with the pills.  It's been fun, but they need to hit the brakes. Both Alma and Ursula are against this since he should feel above the moral code he's claiming he needs to be conscious of.  His selfishness, they say, is unfair.  Harry tells Alma that at last, with no distractions, he'll finally be able to support her to be the best she can be as long as she trusts him. Though she says okay, the look she gives to Ursula seems to indicate that she's lying. \n"}, {"text": "Who steals Eli from his crib?", "correct": "Belle", "options": ["Ursula", "Austin", "The Chemist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBelle.\n\n\tThe day after Harry's announcement, Harry and Alma return home with groceries to find their back door broken open.  Harry checks with Ursula, who's been in the house the entire time, but she claims she had no idea.  It's only when Harry looks upstairs that he finds the note in Eli's empty crib urging him and Alma to be at Belle's house by sunset. If they don't attend their little family meeting, then Eli could be in danger.  Harry realizes that Belle and Austin will never let them leave alive, and Alma is okay with the risk, but it's clearly more complicated than it seems.  Ursula, however, has a plan provided they hear her out. \n"}, {"text": "Ursula is able to lure the pale creatures using which of these?", "correct": "Pills", "options": ["A taser", "Her blood", "Her connections"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPills.\n\n\tHarry and Alma make their way to Belle's home as darkness falls on Provincetown but in the meantime Ursula heads into the local cemetery to begin her plan.  It starts with calling the pale creatures out of their hiding spots with a canister of allegedly more powerful cure-all pills.  While she brings them into the fold, Harry and Alma burst into Belle's home to find her, Austin, and the Chemist already waiting, knives at the ready, to put an end to the troubles that have emerged since the Gardners got involved.\r They only stop themselves when the windows shatter and the pale creatures climb in.  While Belle and Austin turn to fight, the Chemist runs off with Eli and the Gardners are left to watch. \n"}, {"text": "Who kills Harry Gardner?", "correct": "His daughter", "options": ["His wife", "Himself", "His agent"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis daughter.\n\n\tBelle and Austin fight the pale creatures but find themselves quickly overcome by those who have been created by the pills.  It's only when the writers are bleeding out on the floor, being fed on by the beings, that Harry and Alma try to make a run for it, only to find themselves similarly trapped.  The only one able to clear their path is Ursula who, wielding a handgun, brings down the very creatures she planned to swindle into doing her bidding.\r As the Chemist emerges with Eli, she hands him to Ursula.  It's then that Alma lashes out at her unexpected father, bringing him to the ground and feeding on his blood.  She still aims to be the best and achieve perfection, and he can't be there to see it. \n"}, {"text": "Ursula, opting to aid the Chemist for her own gain, moves her where?", "correct": "California", "options": ["Florida", "Texas", "New York"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalifornia.\n\n\tThe Chemist, Ursula, and Alma move onward with their lives (and with Eli).  Though the Chemist gave Ursula the new 'cure-all' pills, the truth was that they were actually rejects and they caused aberrant behaviour in the pale creatures, causing them to turn on even talented users like Belle and Austin.  Ursula knows she can spin the situation as well; the cops will understand that Harry sought to recompense for the problems in Provincetown, going insane and lashing out to kill all those involved.\r Their plan, however, is to head to Los Angeles.  The Chemist can set up shop there and they'll have unfettered access to test subjects. \n"}, {"text": "Alma manages to secure a recital with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThree months later in Hollywood, a pale man in a police uniform walks down Hollywood Boulevard before attacking a tourist.  He's the fifth such officer in recent weeks to commit this type of unprovoked attack, and like the others, he's on the famous 'Bad Apples' list of cops known for committing racially-charged injustices.  Alma lets the Chemist know she shouldn't be tampering with police officers, but the Chemist retorts that Alma shouldn't be feeding on cops either.  The Chemist, however, believes that with no more heights to achieve, it's time for her to be giving back to the community, and this is the way.\r Ursula, meanwhile, has been giving out pills to anyone in her local Starbucks with a script on their laptop.  She will, perhaps, get some good talent from them.\r Alma prepares for her recital at the Walt Disney Concert Hall by feeding on a hustler Ursula brought home and left in the pool house.  When she performs, it's nothing short of perfection.  She finds herself to be a finalist for a seat in the philharmonic orchestra against another prodigy but, instead of patiently waiting for the final answer from the judges, she provokes the other finalist, drinks his blood, and stages his death.  There's only room for one at the top. \n"}, {"text": "An epidemic is created when Ursula gives the pill over to which of these?", "correct": "Students at a writing seminar", "options": ["A medical clinic", "Executives at a major movie studio", "A kindergarten class"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStudents at a writing seminar.\n\n\tUrsula swings herself into a unique position by appearing as the guest of a Los Angeles student writing seminar, and with Harry's works having earned countless awards, her name, as an agent, is now well-known in Hollywood.  Greatness, she tells the audience, comes at a price.  All of the students are willing to bleed for their craft.  As she tells them to reach under their seats, they find a single black pill waiting for them; she lies and says that there's no risk, but that it will unlock their talent.  And sure enough, they swallow it.\r By nightfall, chaos emerges in the Los Angeles city streets as pale creatures feed on people throughout Hollywood.\r The Chemist watches as the epidemic takes hold.  With Eli in the back seat, she starts the car and drives onward, on to another city. \n"}]}
