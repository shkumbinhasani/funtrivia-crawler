Quiz | Baseball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Baseball", "           MLB for Dummies"], "questions": [{"text": "I sincerely loved the game no matter what.  I never looked at the negatives of the game, although one of my teammates sure showed me how not to be.  I retired with 493 home runs in a Yankee uniform, and was forced to retire in 1939.  My name is Lou Gehrig.  Why was I forced to retire?", "correct": "I had a disease", "options": ["I was implicated in a gambling scandal", "My pitching arm was hurt in a 1938 game against the Browns", "I was 48 years old in 1939"], "explanation": "\n\n\nI had a disease.\n\n\tGehrig had a love of the game that was well documented.  No matter what, Lou played the game through injuries throughout his record consecutive game playing streak.  Gehrig had some problems with the lifestyle of teammate Babe Ruth, but rarely publicized them.  He won the 1927 and 1936 AL MVP award, and sandwiched the Triple Crown in 1934.  Gehrig went to seven World Series with the Yankees, winning six of them, and out-homering Babe Ruth in the 1928 World Series, 4-3. \n"}, {"text": "Although I had a big problem with the media, I loved to play the game itself.  My 19 seasons with the Red Sox led to two Triple Crown awards and two MVPs.  I led the league four times with the most home runs.  After retiring in 1960, I still loved the game enough to try my hand at managing.  In four seasons as a manager, the media dogged me so much that it wasn't fun anymore, and I ended my entire baseball career.  Who am I?", "correct": "Ted Williams", "options": ["Brooks Robinson", "Ernie Banks", "Al Kaline"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed Williams.\n\n\tThe others were never Boston Red Sox players.  Williams retired with 521 career home runs, even with missing baseball from 1943-1945 due to World War II.  Nobody knows what might have been, as this player bordered on being the greatest of all-time, and what might have been without his three-season absence. \n"}, {"text": "I truly loved the game.  It didn't really matter which league that I played in, as long as I was playing.  I won a bunch of games before becoming a Major Leaguer at the age of 41.  I just loved to pitch, and my final Major League game was as at the age of 58.  Who am I?", "correct": "Satchel Paige", "options": ["Nolan Ryan", "Cy Young", "Fergie Jenkins"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSatchel Paige.\n\n\tAfter winning an undocumented 2500 games in the Negro League, Paige came to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, one season after teammate Larry Doby broke the color-barrier in the American League.  Paige's best Major League season was in 1952 as a St. Louis Brown, going 12-10 and striking out 91.  Satchel won only 28 games in six seasons in the majors, including a one-game comeback in 1965 with the Royals of Kansas City.  He was a Hall of Fame inductee in 1971. \n"}, {"text": "I had almost given up my baseball love until my father who knew Dodger manager Tom Lasorda, asked him for a favor to draft me.  Ok, so I was a 62nd round draft pick, but I was still drafted.  It was just a favor to my Dad, but once Lasorda saw me play in some try-outs, he felt that I had some promise.  I was then the 1993 NL Rookie of the Year, and played with the Dodger-Blue for seven seasons before being traded to the Florida Marlins.  I refused the trade, and eight days later was handed over to the Mets.  Who am I?", "correct": "Mike Piazza", "options": ["Paul Waner", "Gary Sheffield", "Clete Boyer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMike Piazza.\n\n\tMike batted .318 and hit 35 home runs in 1993.  Although his catching prowess was a negative, his bat more than made up for it.  After only five games with the Marlins, he finished the season in 1998 with the Mets, batting .348 and hitting 23 home runs in 109 games.  In 2005, Mike was still in a Mets uniform in his 14th season. \n"}, {"text": "After the age of 19, I played nine seasons with Houston.  In 1971, I was involved in a multi-player trade to the Cincinnati Reds.  It didn't matter as I just wanted to play the game.  It was in Cincinnati that I made my name as a second baseman.  I won five Gold Gloves and two season MVPs as a Red, and was part of the infamous 'Big Red Machine' in the 1970s.  Who am I?", "correct": "Joe Morgan", "options": ["Albie Pearson", "Ron Cey", "Phil Rizzuto"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Morgan.\n\n\tIn Joe's first season with the Reds in 1972, he was named the all-star MVP.  1975 and 1976 brought him NL MVP awards as part of the Big Red Machine which took the Reds to consecutive World Series victories.  After being inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1990, Morgan became a sports analyst. \n"}, {"text": "My entire 22 seasons were with the St. Louis Cardinals.  I went to four World Series with the team, and won three season MVP awards myself.  I went to 20 all-star games just because I loved the game.  I retired with 475 home runs and seven batting titles.  Who am I?", "correct": "Stan Musial", "options": ["Luke Appling", "Luis Aparicio", "Willie Stargell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStan Musial.\n\n\tMusial played from 1941-1963, missing the 1945 season due to World War II.  The number six jersey-wearing Cardinal retired with a .331 batting average and a 1944 World Series home run.  'Stan the Man' was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1969, in the minimal time allowed for inductees of six years. \n"}, {"text": "I loved to play the game.  I knew that I was good, and I loved to pitch.  When scouts discovered me, I tried to get them to look at my brother Paul too, but that didn't work out for some time.  The St. Louis Cardinals gave me my start in the 1930 season, and it was for only one game but I won it.  They kept me on!  I was the 1934 NL MVP with the Gas House Gang Cardinals, winning 30 games in the season.  It would be the last time that anyone won 30 until Denny McLain of the 1968 Tigers.  From 1934-1937, my brother Paul and I finally shared the same mound with the Cardinals.  Who am I?", "correct": "Dizzy Dean", "options": ["Ron Santo", "Joe DiMaggio", "Hank Greenberg"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDizzy Dean.\n\n\tThe others weren't pitchers.  Dizzy had a great career with the Cardinals until he was hit by a ball in the 1937 all-star game.  His career went downhill from there and was sold to the Chicago Cubs where he never won more than eight games in a season again.  He retired in 1947, and was a Hall of Fame inductee in 1953.  Jay Hanna 'Dizzy' Dean died in 1974 at the age of 64. \n"}, {"text": "The front part of my baseball career was great!  I went to three World Series with New York teams in the National League over 14 seasons.  Even with managing the New York Yankees, I was on top of the world by taking them to 10 World Series.  I was on top of everything until 'it' happened.  I was asked to manage the new expansion team New York Mets.  In my first three seasons as a manager, my Mets lost over 100 games in each season.  I couldn't believe that I let that happen.  Who am I?", "correct": "Casey Stengel", "options": ["Tony LaRussa", "Leo Durocher", "Joe Torre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasey Stengel.\n\n\tCasey played mostly for the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants.  He went to one World Series as a Dodger and two as a Giant.  In 1962, after a Cinderella era with the Yankees at the helm, he took on the New York Mets.  Stengel was replaced in his fourth season at the helm by Wes Westrum. \n"}, {"text": "I can't believe that I let myself be a mockery of baseball.  I let Bill Veeck pay me to be a pinch-hitter in 1951, even though I was less than four feet tall.  I didn't know at the time that it would create so much of a farce.  Who am I?", "correct": "Eddie Gaedel", "options": ["Rogers Hornsby", "Milton Berle", "Lou Boudreau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEddie Gaedel.\n\n\tThe 3'7\" small person was a well documented fiasco in Major League baseball with the St. Louis Browns in the 1951 season.  Another of Bill Veeck's publicity stunts, baseball changed its rules after this incident about height requirements.  Gaedel was killed as a result of a mugging in Chicago, 10 days after his 36th birthday in 1961. \n"}, {"text": "I was nicknamed for my playoff-time home run outputs.  It got to the point where it was a home run or nothing.  I guess it got away from me because I retired by being the first player in history to reach 2000 strikeouts, and unfortunately when I retired, I was still the only hitter with 2000 strikeouts, retiring with 2597 in 1987.  Holy cow, I did that!  Who am I?", "correct": "Reggie Jackson", "options": ["Del Crandell", "Boog Powell", "Ozzie Smith"], "explanation": "\n\n\nReggie Jackson.\n\n\tAfter playing with the Athletics, Yankees, Angels, and one season with the Orioles, Reggie had this dubious honor.  Jackson's 18 postseason home runs earned him the nickname, 'Mr. October'.  These included his five home runs in the 1977 World Series.  Jackson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993. \n"}]}
