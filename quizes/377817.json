{"id": "377817", "name": "\"Chutes and Ladders\" Quiz | American Horror Story - Seasons and Episodes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "American Horror Story", "Episodes", "American Horror Story: Hotel"], "questions": [{"text": "Where in the Hotel Cortez does Sally hide Gabriel?", "correct": "In a mattress", "options": ["In a laundry chute", "In the vents", "Under a stairwell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn a mattress.\n\n\tSally, in one of the rooms of the Hotel Cortez, sews Gabriel into the mattress of a bed.  While she told him he'd be free if he listened to her, she lied; he can't cheat death.  She kisses him and pushes him into the bed as a scream is heard through the vents; one of the Swedish tourists is crying for help downstairs-- children are feeding off her arms.  Iris knows the girl will stop screaming eventually...and she does, but only when she's dead.  Elizabeth Taylor wheels the girl into the laundry cupboard and dumps her into the chute...with the other bodies down there.\rIn the childrens' secret room, Iris takes their blood and fills it into a carafe to pass off to The Countess.  Donovan refuses to see his mother, only emerging when she leaves, and the two indulge in their drinks.  The Countess wants to go out to an art show to hunt; since Donovan wants to stay in, she goes alone. \n"}, {"text": "Dr. Lowe, checking in on a house call, finds that her patient has which of the following?", "correct": "The measles", "options": ["The flu", "Polio", "Nothing wrong with them"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe measles.\n\n\tDr. Lowe, making a house call, tells a worried mother that her child has the measles and criticizes her for her stance on vaccination.  Considering her son went missing, she makes a point of warning the mother to protect her child.\rIn Room 64, Det. Lowe wakes up to the sound of his alarm clock turning on.  Shortly after, the maid comes in, asking if he'd like the room turned down.  When she leaves, he's startled by the momentary appearance of a demonic creature, but it disappears.  In the bathroom, ghostly figures in his shower, make their presence known and he wakes up once again, evidently having fallen into a nightmare.  Oddly, the radio is on again.  Getting up out of bed, Lowe looks out into the hall to once again see his missing son, Holden, and he quickly takes up chase through the stairwells and corridors, losing him by the time he reaches the empty lobby. \n"}, {"text": "Det. Lowe admits to Sally that his original vice was which of these?", "correct": "Alcohol", "options": ["Cocaine", "Marijuana", "Heroin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlcohol.\n\n\tDet. Lowe ends up at the bar in the Hotel Cortez where Sally starts asking questions.  While Lowe ends up sipping at a ginger ale, Sally talks about back when she used to write poetry and write songs for Patti Smith.  She used to enjoy doing drugs, but she got lost in the addiction.  Looking to Lowe, she feels as though he's looking to get lost as well.\rLowe tells her his story.  While investigating a double homicide, he took a look around the scene of the crime to find the truth...a man shot himself, but his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning that night.  That was the night he went straight to the bar.  Two days later he returned home and took his family to the beach, but that was the trip he lost his son. \n"}, {"text": "Claudia, one of Will Drake's guests at the Hotel Cortez, writes for what magazine?", "correct": "Vogue", "options": ["Esquire", "Cosmopolitan", "Maxim"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVogue.\n\n\tAt the office, Det. Lowe discovers that the victims in his investigation were both contacted by the same number with the same messages, likely the same person who texted him the earlier night.  Finding a package at his desk from the Hotel Cortez, Lowe calls in the bomb squad.  They open it to find a statuette; he sends it to the lab.\rAt the Hotel Cortez, Will Drake welcomes Claudia, a \"Vogue\" writer, to the preparation for his fashion show while Liz Taylor entertains the party guests.  Det. Lowe returns to the hotel to meet Will, who introduces himself as the new owner, before Scarlett arrives, and they're both invited to stay for the show.  At the front door, Sally makes a scene when she's refused entry to the building.\rThe show begins as The Countess and Donovan take their seats.  Scarlett and Lachlan, Will's son, run off to find something more fun to do, while famous, rebel fashion model Tristan Duffy takes to the catwalk after snorting some cocaine.  Tristan nearly starts a fight during his walk, but when he catches the eyes of The Countess, he stops himself.  Donovan is instantly jealous.\rIn the back room, Tristan announces to Will that he's done with modelling.  To enforce his point, he cuts his face. \n"}, {"text": "How does Tristan find his way to the 7th floor?", "correct": "His elevator stops there", "options": ["He wakes up there", "He's led there by a maid", "He takes the stairs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis elevator stops there.\n\n\tLachlan and Scarlett, heading through the halls of the hotel, make their way down to the empty pool in the basement to find four glass coffins, each one containing one of The Countess' white-haired children...and amongst them is Holden.\rTristan, meanwhile, stalks his way to the penthouse suite of the Hotel Cortez looking for cocaine and breaks in.  Donovan stops him though, and starts to strangle him.  At the last moment, The Countess enters and commands her boyfriend to stop, allowing the former model to escape to the elevator.\rThis proves to be a bad escape route; the elevator screeches to a halt on the 7th floor and Tristan wanders into a room fashioned with decades-old amenities; a record plays in the living room while he steals from the dressers.  Of course...he's found. \n"}, {"text": "Scarlett, finding her brother in the Hotel Cortez, realizes which of these things about him?", "correct": "He hasn't aged", "options": ["He doesn't remember her", "He's freezing cold", "He smells like garbage"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe hasn't aged.\n\n\tTristan is found by the tenant of the room on the 7th floor, a seemingly eccentric man almost removed from time.  With a whistle, the man calls upon his laundress who appears with a prostitute from the bar, tied up.  The man urges Tristan to shoot the girl and end her life to feel the thrill, but when he refuses, the man tears off his scarf to reveal a gash across his neck, and shoots the woman in the head.  Tristan flees down the hall, back to the elevator, and runs into The Countess.\rWhile the clean-up crews work their way through the Hotel Cortez lobby the next day, Scarlett enters, having taken a bus back, to find that the coffins in the pool are now empty.  Finding her way to the secret room in the hallway, she arrives to find her brother, and he's been expecting her.  Unfortunately, he can't go with her.  Scarlett, afraid of the situation, heads out to leave but is caught by Sally in the hallway who, laughing at the girl, grins until her teeth fall out.  Luckily, Scarlett is able to wriggle away and get to the elevator. \n"}, {"text": "In what decade was The Countess born?", "correct": "1900s", "options": ["1930s", "1980s", "1860s"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1900s.\n\n\tScarlett returns home that evening to find the police outside; evidently they were looking for her for five hours.  She tells her parents that she wanted to see if she really saw Holden there.  She asserts that she just talked to her brother, and he's not dead.  She hands her father her phone when she runs to her room and demands that they look at the picture she took, but Holden's not in it; there's a blur where he was.\rTristan talks to The Countess about his newfound immortality-- she's infected him with the virus and restored him to near-flawless health.  She tells him that they have no fangs, but they must feed on the blood of the living.  She also warns him against sunlight as it will sap his vitality.  Her final warning is that his own recklessness will probably undo him, and he should never fall in love.\rTristan discovers that The Countess was born in 1904 and she recounts her favourite times before Donovan returns to the apartment.  She decides that she's throwing him out...and breaking his heart. \n"}, {"text": "The man behind the Hotel Cortez, James March, built it with which visual aesthetic in mind?", "correct": "Art Deco", "options": ["Gothic", "Art Nouveau", "Baroque"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArt Deco.\n\n\tDet. Lowe, angry coming back to the Hotel Cortez, finds Iris behind the desk and handcuffs her, alleging that she is likely an accomplice to murder.  She says that she'll tell him what he wants to know, but he'll need to uncuff her, ask nice, and buy her a drink at the bar.  Liz Taylor pours.  Lowe refuses the glass.\rIris starts the story at the beginning with the man Tristan saw on the 7th floor-- James Patrick March-- the man who put his own internal evil into the construction of the building, which he would use to exact his twisted fantasies.  A design freak from the 1920s, he demanded secret passages, dead ends, and impossible architecture.  Of course, his almost limitless funds...and pulling of puppetstrings...allowed the place to get built. \n"}, {"text": "What was the name of Mr. March's laundress?", "correct": "Miss Evers", "options": ["Miss Bankson", "Miss Royale", "Miss Ellison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMiss Evers.\n\n\tMarch, while building his hotel, was particularly notorious while trying to get it built.  When questioned about the impossible blueprints placed before his builders, he was also killing his foremen and hiding their bodies down chutes, catching young women and bricking them up into the walls, and killing, on average, three people in a week, all while encouraged by his wife. He also had an ardent supporter in his laundress, Miss Evers, who claimed she could get a stain out of any sheet for Mr. March simply through her love.  To say the least, the hotel and the people residing in it were insulated from any suspicion...and not just because of the asbestos lining the walls, muffing out the screams. \n"}, {"text": "Det. Lowe realizes that the serial killer he's trying to follow is murdering based around which of these themes?", "correct": "The Ten Commandments", "options": ["The books of the Old Testament", "The Seven Deadly Sins", "Names in the Bible"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ten Commandments.\n\n\tWhen Mr. March killed a group of workers one afternoon and took the opportunity to make a stand against religion (by bringing the bodies and the Bibles from each room to an open field) he got too sloppy and left his monogrammed handkerchief at the scene of the crime.  It wasn't long before he was turned in; Iris believes it was his wife that did it (for the money).  The day the cops showed up was the day Mr. March shot a willing Miss Evers in the head and slit his own throat.\rDet. Lowe tells Iris that she should write for the movies, but she insists that she's telling the truth.  She informs him that she's staying in the room that was formerly Mr. March's office, effectively the heart of the hotel.\rThe story gets Det. Lowe thinking though.  Back at the office, Det. Lowe draws connections-- the killer he's searching for is picking up where Mr. March left off, killing offenders of the Ten Commandments.\rBack at the Hotel Cortez, Tristan hooks up with a guy from Tinder, bringing him up to the penthouse, stabbing him in the neck, and sharing him with The Countess. \n"}]}
