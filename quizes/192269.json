{"id": "192269", "name": "JFK Assassination: A Conspiracy Theorist's View Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", "     U.S. Presidents", " John F. Kennedy"], "questions": [{"text": "According to conspiracy theorists, which of these was a suspect in the shooting of JFK?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["CIA and Big Oil", "The Mob & The Right Wing", "The Military & Cuban Factions"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tAccording to conspiracy theorists, JFK had intelligence and charm - but he made plenty of enemies. He was perceived by some as being \"soft\" on Communism. He also had to endure the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs (thus alienating both pro-Castro and anti-Castro Cubans). In addition, the Mob (which allegedly had helped JFK get elected) felt betrayed by RFK's \"war on crime\". \n"}, {"text": "What reason has been given by conspiracy theorists for the assassination of JFK?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Vietnam", "The Bay of Pigs", "The War on Crime"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tJFK was supposedly about to pull out of Vietnam (and dismantle or radically revise the FBI and CIA). Some Cubans felt betrayed because he had launched an offensive against Castro at the Bay of Pigs; other Cubans felt betrayed that he had failed to follow through with the invasion and thereby doomed it to failure. The Mob felt betrayed by the war on crime that was launched by the Attorney General, RFK. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these claims has been made about Lee Harvey Oswald?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["He was anti-Castro, but posing as pro-Castro", "He was working with U.S. intelligence", "He was a \"fall guy\" for  the conspiracy"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tNotwithstanding the perfectly reasonable \"lone nut\" theory that has been placed on Oswald (and on Ruby, too), conspiracy theorists love to believe that Oswald worked with U.S. intelligence, posing as a defector in the Soviet Union. They allege that his very visible pro-Castro activities (such as handing out \"Fair Play for Cuba\" pamphlets) was a pose, to cover his anti-Castro activities. Upon being arrested, Oswald denied killing anyone and said that he was merely a \"patsy\". But then he would, wouldn't he? \n"}, {"text": "Conspiracy theorists also have lots of ideas about Jack Ruby. Which of these has been said about him?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["He was connected to the Dallas cops", "He was connected to the Mob", "He was acquainted with Oswald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tConspiracy theorists are convinced that Ruby was connected to the Mob, despite (or more likely because of) the contrary findings of the Warren Commission. He was also said to have been \"tight\" with the Dallas police - thus explaining how he was able to gain easy access to Oswald while Oswald was in custody. Claims have also been made that Oswald and Ruby knew each other prior to Nov. 22. \n"}, {"text": "What claim has been made by conspiracy theorists about J.D. Tippitt?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["He encountered Oswald by chance", "He was supposed to provide transportation for Oswald to escape", "He was supposed to kill Oswald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tPolice Officer Tippitt was killed shortly after JFK was shot. While most sources agree that Tippitt simply came upon Oswald by chance, conspiracy theorists have tried to claim that Tippitt was involved in the events of Nov. 22. Some say that he was supposed to provide transportation away from Dallas (to Cuba, where the assassination could be blamed on Castro). Others say that Tippitt was supposed to kill Oswald, thereby eliminating any possibility that Oswald would reveal what he knew. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these claims has been made by conspiracy theorists about the Warren Commission?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Chief Justice Warren refused Ruby's offer to provide information outside of Dallas", "It ignored evidence that had been provided by various witnesses", "It was misled by the FBI"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tRuby offered to talk if Warren would get him out of Dallas; Warren \"passed\" on the opportunity. Meanwhile, the Commission was handicapped by the fact that it relied on the FBI for information - but J. Edgar Hoover and his men had an interest in perpetuating the \"lone nut\" story. In addition, many witnesses have said that the Commission ignored or misrepresented their testimony. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these claims has been made by conspiracy theorists about the evidence in the JFK assassination case?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["There was tampering with the medical evidence", "An impostor impersonated Oswald", "There was tampering with photographic evidence"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tIt has been said that there was tampering with the Zapruder film and with the so-called \"backyard photos\" of Oswald holding rifles and Communist newspapers. It has also been said that there was tampering with medical evidence - and with the body of JFK. In addition, it has been said that the \"setting up\" of Oswald as the fall guy included impersonators who claimed - loudly enough to make an impression - that they were Oswald. \n"}, {"text": "According to conspiracy theorists, which of the following has been said to have had prior knowledge of the assassination?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["J. Edgar Hoover", "Lyndon B. Johnson", "Richard Nixon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tUnsubstantiated claims have been made that all of these (as well as numerous other people) knew in advance about a plot to assassinate Kennedy. None have ever been shown to be true. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these people apparently died under mysterious circumstances?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["George De Mohrenschildt", "David Ferrie", "Dorothy Kilgallen"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tConspiracy theorists love to make claims about the number of people who died under \"mysterious circumstances\". Apparently, Ferrie died shortly before New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison was going to talk to him; Ferrie's friend, Eladio Del Valle, also died at the same time under mysterious circumstances. De Mohrenschildt, an Oswald \"contact\" when Oswald returned to the U.S. from the Soviet Union (and an intelligence agent), \"committed suicide\" shortly before he was scheduled to testify.Kilgallen, a prominent reporter who interviewed Ruby in jail and claimed to have uncovered valuable information, also died under curious circumstances.\n"}, {"text": "Which of the following has been confidently identified as a shooter responsible for assassinating JFK?", "correct": "All of these", "options": ["Lucien Sarti", "Charles Harrelson", "Roscoe White"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these.\n\n\tHarrelson, father of actor Woody Harrelson, has been identified by some as one of the shooters (and has, at times, admitted to being one). Roscoe White has been identified by his son as one of the shooters. Sarti has been identified by Christian David (imprisoned in a French prison) as a shooter. It remains unclear how they could all have done it, but hey, logic isn't important to the people who make these claims. \n"}]}
