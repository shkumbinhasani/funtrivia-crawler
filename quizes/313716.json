If there's one thing to be learned from John Polidori's story, it's that you shouldn't hang around them too much.  What was the name of this prototypical vampire work?", "correct": "The Vampyre", "options": ["Bloodlust", "The Doppelganger", "Revanant"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Vampyre.\n\n\tPolidori's idea to create this precursor to the vampire genre emerged from a quite famous gathering at Villa Diodati.  While the stories, which emerged from said gathering, included Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", \"The Vampyre\" was also quite monumental in its own right.  Based on a character known as Aubrey, the tale follows a young man who takes himself along in the company of the gentlemanly, aristocratic Lord Ruthven.  Eventually, he comes to discover that there is something not right about the man who has a tendency to allure women around him before they mysteriously disappear.\r Overall this story, a roman a clef, was a thinly-veiled satire.  In real life, Polidori related Lord Ruthven to the famous Lord Byron and Aubrey to himself.  In a sense, it was a matter of making fun of his former boss. Make sure you watch who you're spending your time with! \n"}, {"text": "You're 'sick' of vampires you say?  Do you mean sick 'from' vampires?  Are you infected?\n\nWhich of these isn't a typical characteristic of vampires which I could use to determine your true nature?", "correct": "Vampires are typically much shorter in size than humans", "options": ["Vampires have a natural aversion to religion", "Vampires don't give a reflection in a mirror", "Vampires cannot go into the sunlight"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVampires are typically much shorter in size than humans.\n\n\tGothic literature and folklore has grown over centuries and centuries of retelling that the original characteristics of vampires have changed vastly to appeal to new media.  Originally, the mirror image quirk was never a major concern, at least until literature formed the attribute around the creature.  In many Gothic and Enlightenment works, mirrors are reflective of reality; vampires, having lost their soul already, do not appear in the reflection. Similarly, vampires, since way back, have despised sunlight, feeling intense pain in awakening during daylight hours and experiencing the ultraviolet light. Even J. Sheridan LeFanu's \"Carmilla\" experiences such odd sleeping patterns.  Carmilla also avoids saying her prayers and walking on religious ground.  Perhaps the most frightening is the fact that many vampires will assume their regular forms.  Although you'd be undead, your image would remain the same, blending into the crowd; if anything, some vampires show an increase in stature.  I hope this doesn't escalate your fear... \n"}, {"text": "Afraid to go out at night?  Perhaps you needn't worry about popping on a turtleneck to go out on the town.\n\nAre vampire bats physically able to feed off living humans?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tWell, it has been known to happen in a few instances, but the occurrence is quite rare.  Vampire bats are similar to most other bats out there, emerging at night to feed because of their nocturnal pattern and using echolocation and such, but the difference is that vampire bats also retain sustenance from blood, whether it be human or any other mammal.  Vampire bats are found in North and South America (far enough from Transylvania) and they've been around longer than the first vampire story was ever told, but their name was attributed to the species based on early Gothic horror stories.  \"Dracula\", for example, makes good use of the species as the titular vampire is able to transform back and forth into one of these creatures at will.\r Sure, it'll drive you batty, but I'm sure you have nothing to fear.  Just carry a tennis racket (not a bat...we don't need the reminder) around with you. \n"}, {"text": "One thing we can do is ward off any vampires if your concern is a horrible truth.  What is the term used for such a ritual?", "correct": "Apotropaic Ritual", "options": ["Revenant Ward", "De-Resurrection", "Exorcism"], "explanation": "\n\n\nApotropaic Ritual.\n\n\tApotropaic rituals are preventative measures which can be used to stop vampires either before they rise from the grave or during their onslaught.  The implementation of garlic, for example, will stop a vampire from advancing in most cases as well as the use of religious artifacts such as rosaries or crucifixes. Some vampire lore states that crossing running water will stop a vampire from catching you while some states that herbal remedies will prevent vampires from coming anywhere near you.  In Eastern European countries, people used to wear cloves of garlic around their necks to protect themselves. Burying bodies properly before the shift into the vampire was also a necessity.  Some cemeteries buried bodies with nets (as if that would fool them), buried them upside-down (again, seriously), or spread poppy seeds around graves. \n"}, {"text": "If ever attacked by a vampire, it's probably best to know how to destroy it.  One night, you'll probably be walking alone in a vampiric part of town and BAM, vampire on your neck.  You just don't want that.\n\nPerhaps the most common method of killing a vampire is with a wooden stake.  Where must the stake be plunged?", "correct": "Into the heart", "options": ["Into the brain", "Into the stomach", "Into the neck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInto the heart.\n\n\tAlthough most lore, stories, and movies lead the stake directly to the heart, some instances in real life have reported to stakes being used in the mouth (to prevent vampires from biting victims) and the brain to stop their thoughts.  During the Vampire Epidemics in Europe in the 1700s, many bodies were staked in the heart after death as an apotropaic ritual.  Better safe than sorry, right?\r Some tales say that vampires must and can only be killed through sunlight or decapitation while others say that complicated procedures such as drowning in holy water are the only method.  Buffy makes it look so easy. \n"}, {"text": "I wouldn't trust film actors.  Just because they appeared on screens as vampires doesn't mean they're acting!  It just means they fit the role.\n\nWhich of these actors wouldn't be a vampire by this standard?", "correct": "Christian Bale", "options": ["Antonio Banderas", "Tom Cruise", "Brad Pitt"], "explanation": "\n\n\nChristian Bale.\n\n\tThe three incorrect answers all appeared in the adaptation of Anne Rice's \"Interview with a Vampire\", the first of her works in the series to be adapted as a film.  Tom Cruise starred as Lestat, Brad Pitt starred as Louis de Pointe du Lac, and Antonio Banderas starred as Armand.  The film also starred the (I assure you, real vampires who are) Kirsten Dunst and Stephen Rea.  Other vampire actors to watch out for include Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Wesley Snipes, and Salma Hayek.  If you see ANY of these people in real life, reach for the crucifix.\rChristian Bale has yet to be bitten.  Let me repeat: being the Batman does not make you a vampire.  You can tell he's trying though. \n"}, {"text": "Do some research before you set up shop.  Moving, we know, can be a horribly stressful ordeal, but a simple digging-up of information can go a long way.\n\nWhich of these locations should be vampire-free?", "correct": "Harper's Island", "options": ["Sunnydale", "Salem's Lot", "Los Angeles"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarper's Island.\n\n\tAlthough none of these places is particularly safe (though Los Angeles is the safest...I mean, you have the numbers working with you), Harper's Island is particularly known for being home to a vicious serial killer, known for more than one spree in his lifetime.  The 2009 TV show \"Harper's Island\" outlined the obscure murders which happened on the island when a wedding party was held there.\r Vampire-ophobe?  Sunnydale is home to \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Los Angeles\" is home to \"Angel\", the spin-off of the former show, and \"'Salem's Lot\" is home to Stephen King's vampires in his second published novel.  A movie and a mini-series have been made regarding this one.  Sure, your bloodsucking real estate agents and lawyers want you to move there, but should you really trust them? \n"}, {"text": "See!  Even if we were to have vampires, you'd have nothing to worry about.  Predetermined 'slayers' will arrive to quell the unnecessary spread of the zombie populous.\n\nWhich of these actresses portrayed such a role?", "correct": "Sarah Michelle Gellar", "options": ["Milla Jovovich", "Jessica Alba", "Lucy Liu"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar.\n\n\tIn a role originally occupied by Kristy Swanson in the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" movie released in 1992, Sarah Michelle Gellar became famous for her role on this show, inevitably becoming a 'scream queen' so to speak.  After and during production of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", Gellar appeared in \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"Scream 2\", two Americanized \"Grudge\" films, \"The Return\", and two \"Scooby-Doo\" films (both of which were infinitely scarier...believe me).  The \"Buffy\" TV show propelled the WB network's ratings and grew a Joss Whedon cult following (many members of which are also kind of like vampires).  Milla Jovovich starred in the vampire-like film \"Ultraviolet\", but she's more of a zombie film actress (case in point: \"Resident Evil\" franchise). \n"}, {"text": "Quick!  Turn off the TV!  Too many vampires there too!\n\nWhat HBO vampire TV show stars Anna Paquin?", "correct": "True Blood", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue Blood.\n\n\tBased on a series of novels by Charlaine Harris, Anna Paquin stars in \"True Blood\" as Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who can read minds in Louisiana (is there nowhere these vampires won't go?).  Soon, she discovers the presence of vampires in her quiet little town.  The show has since been quite popular reaching the status of HBO's other highly-rated shows \"Sex and the City\" and \"The Sopranos\", both of which completed their runs years before \"True Blood\" began. A single season of the TV show \"Blade\" also aired on Spike TV a few years prior and the Canadian TV show \"Blood Ties\" ran two seasons in 2007 proving that vampires have indeed forced their way onto the small screen. No one is safe. \n"}, {"text": "Don't walk into book stores anymore!  It's a haven for vampire literature; tomes of preteen joy sit on the shelves waiting to strike.  Stephanie Meyer becomes a name to fear.  Which of these stories (which she wrote) is vampire-free?", "correct": "The Host", "options": ["Breaking Dawn", "New Moon", "Eclipse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Host.\n\n\tAlthough all of the rest of the options are sequels to \"Twilight\" (you've heard of it...trust me), \"The Host\" was released before \"Breaking Dawn\".  \"The Host\", rather than revolving around vampire teenagers who can walk outside during the day and who enjoy partaking in America's pastime in thunderstorms, instead focuses on a supernatural theme of alien invasion through the minds and thoughts of humans. These 'souls' regulate human thought to essentially take over, and in effect they remove the very part of humans that make them free-thinking and individualized.  It's kind of like handing a copy of \"Twilight\" to a young girl. As for advertisements for her other, vampire-full books, just rip out the front and back pages.  That should do it. \n"}]}
