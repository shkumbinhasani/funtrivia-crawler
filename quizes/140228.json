Janet Van Dyne, better known as the Wasp was a founding member of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  Greer Nelson served aboard the West Coast branch of the Avengers as Tigra.

She served as a reserve member of the Avengers until her untimely death at the hands of Iron Man. \n"}, {"text": "The Scarlet Spider of the dreaded 'Spider-Man: Clone Saga' was merely but a clone of the original Peter Parker.  In order to create a separate life for himself, he took the name Ben Reilly.  Where did Ben take the name 'Reilly' from?", "correct": "Aunt May's Maiden Name", "options": ["Peter's brother who passed away in infacy", "May and Ben Parker's stillborn child", "Richard and Mary Parker's adopted son"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAunt May's Maiden Name.\n\n\tDid anything good come of the Clone Saga?  My answer to that question is always a resounding Yes.  From the Clone Saga, Spider-Man's greatest villain return, Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin.  Osborn was found to be behind all of the plotting of the Clone Saga, even going as far as to kidnap Peter and Mary Jane's newborn baby, and replacing it with a stillborn child.  Will the Spider-Baby ever return? \n"}, {"text": "Which of the Black Knights listed below fought with the Masters of Evil?", "correct": "Black Knight II - Nathan Garrett", "options": ["Black Knight III - Dane Whitman", "Black Knight IV - Arthur Pendragon", "Black Knight I - Sir Percy of Scandia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBlack Knight II - Nathan Garrett.\n\n\tThe second man to wear the mantle of the Black Knight in the Marvel Universe was that of Nathan Garrett, uncle to the third Black Knight, and Avenger, Dane Whitman.  Garrett perished in battle with the Avengers when his robotic steed malfunctioned and fell to the ground.

Black Mamba is a female member of the Serpent Society, foes of Captain America.  Black Crow is a Native American avenging spirit in mystic warrior form of Jesse Black Crow, a disabled construction worker.  Black Fox is an elderly thief who has been thwarted by Spider-Man on numerous occasions, but always let go because the ol' web head feels bad for the old guy.  I think he needs to visit the Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa Simpson. \n"}, {"text": "The original Black Widow, Natalie (formerly Natasha) Romanov was married to what costumed identity?", "correct": "The Red Guardian", "options": ["The Red Avenger", "The Red Raven", "The Red Ghost"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Red Guardian.\n\n\tThe Red Guardian was the Russian equivalent of Captain America.

They are absorbed by a victim via skin or nasal passage, rendering the individual(s) completely within Killgrave's control.  Only a few people have been recorded to be completely unaffected by the pheromones namely Dr. Doom and the good ol' Ionic Avenger himself, Wonder Man.  The Purple Man's thugs use projective gas emitters to release what Killgrave has deemed his 'Purple Will-Deadening Gas'. \n"}, {"text": "Which one of these characters never took up the mantle of the Green Goblin?", "correct": "Jason Macendale", "options": ["Barton Hamilton", "Harry Osborn", "Phil Urich"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason Macendale.\n\n\tJason Philip Macendale, a ruthless mercenary, first wore the guise of the Jack O' Lantern, and later the second Hobgoblin, but never wore the Green Goblin armor.  Harry Osborn was the son of the original Green Goblin, and the second to wear the Goblin suit.  While being hospitalized for insanity, Harry's psychiatrist, Dr. Barton Hamilton learned of his dual identity and took up the mantle of the third Green Goblin for financial gain.

The Skull climbed the Nazi ranks quickly, eventually ascending to the second in command, only behind Adolph Hitler himself. \n"}]}
