City Editor Joe Robertson (Bill Nunn) gets about four lines in the scenes at the DAILY BUGLE. Dr. Connors -- the alter ego of the super-villain known as the Lizard in the comics -- is mentioned as the man who fires Peter Parker from his part-time job, but we never see him. No mention whatsoever is made of Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doctor Octopus...until the sequel. \n"}, {"text": "What is the designation of the laboratory in which Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) exposes himself to the treatments that turn him into the Green Goblin?", "correct": "C35", "options": ["D35", "C33", "D33"], "explanation": "\n\n\nC35.\n\n\tAs Mendel Stromm reluctantly assists Osborn with his plan to use himself as a guinea pig, we get a clear shot of a wall labeled with the words 'LAB C35'. \n"}, {"text": "Harry Osborn (James Franco) is uncomfortable about letting his classmates see that his father Norman has brought him to a school field trip in a certain type of automobile. What is the make of the car?", "correct": "Rolls Royce", "options": ["Lamborghini", "Porsche", "Jaguar"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRolls Royce.\n\n\tHarry points out that his classmates are public school kids, and that they might react adversely to seeing him step out of a Rolls. \n"}, {"text": "Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) tells Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) that her performance as Cinderella once brought tears to his eyes. MJ quickly notes that said performance took place quite some time ago. In what grade were Peter and MJ when she played Cinderella?", "correct": "the first grade", "options": ["the second grade", "the third grade", "the fourth grade"], "explanation": "\n\n\nthe first grade.\n\n\tMJ: 'Peter -- that was in first grade.' Oddly, Harry later tells his father that Peter has been in love with MJ since the *fourth* grade. Why the gap? \n"}, {"text": "Once Peter gains his powers, his first idea for the name he should go by is *not* 'Spider-Man.' What is it?", "correct": "The Human Spider & Human Spider & 'Human Spider' & 'The Human Spider'", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Human Spider & Human Spider & 'Human Spider' & 'The Human Spider'.\n\n\tWhen Peter first dons a mask and attends the free-for-all wrestling match, he tells the announcer that his name is 'The Human Spider.' The announcer (frequent Sam Raimi collaborator Bruce Campbell) deems this a stupid name, however, and introduces Peter as 'The amazing Spider-Man.' \n"}, {"text": "True or False: the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity before Spider-Man discovers the Green Goblin's secret identity.", "correct": "true & t & yes & y", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ntrue & t & yes & y.\n\n\tNorman Osborn deduces that Peter is Spider-Man based on a laceration on Peter's forearm that Norman, as the Goblin, saw Spider-Man suffer only hours before.

Peter blows off the chore, but Ben and May's note to him (once he gets home late, and the kitchen has been painted without him) still calls him 'Michaelangelo' without, it seems, a trace of sarcasm or rancor. \n"}, {"text": "According to the movie, what college does Peter Parker attend?", "correct": "It's never specified", "options": ["Columbia University", "Empire State University", "He never attends college in the movie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIt's never specified.\n\n\tOddly, Peter's college is never specified, nor is he ever shown going to classes. In the comics, Peter attended the fictional Empire State University, but there's no mention of that school in the film. There's a Columbia sticker (or is it a magnet?) on the side of the refrigerator in Peter and Harry's apartment, but if either of them actually attends classes there, it's never stated outright by anyone in the movie. Aunt May, while in the hospital, complains that Peter is doing too much, what with 'college and a job,' but were it not for that line, we'd have no indication that Peter goes to college at all!\r Empire State University is formally identified as Peter's school in 'Spider-Man 2.' \n"}, {"text": "Finish Uncle Ben's favorite axiom, which serves as the theme of the movie: 'With great power ________________________________.'", "correct": "comes great responsibility", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\ncomes great responsibility.\n\n\tI was both surprised and pleased when fully a quarter of the audience said those words along with Ben (and me!) when that essential line was spoken in the theater. \n"}, {"text": "Which soda brand snagged a lucrative product placement in this movie?", "correct": "Dr. Pepper", "options": ["Pepsi", "Coke", "Sprite"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDr. Pepper\n\n\tPeter uses a prominently featured Dr. Pepper can as one of his 'targets' for testing out his web-shooting abilities in his bedroom.

Which is NOT one of them?", "correct": "Electro", "options": ["Green Goblin II", "Venom", "The Lizard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nElectro.\n\n\tDAILY BUGLE employee Eddie Brock -- who, in the comics, acts as the human host for the arch-villain Venom -- is mentioned in passing during a discussion between J. Jonah Jameson and Joe 'Robbie' Robertson. Curt Connors, the Lizard, is the unseen scientist who fires Peter Parker after he misses too much work. Harry Osborn vows to avenge his father's death at the hands (so he thinks) of Spider-Man; his transformation into the second Green Goblin is practically guaranteed. \r Max Dillon, the New York Power and Light lineman who (in the comics) becomes Electro, is not seen or mentioned in the movie. \n"}, {"text": "Marvel Comics guru Stan Lee manages to make a cameo appearance in most filmed productions based on his creations, and 'Spider-Man' is no exception.
