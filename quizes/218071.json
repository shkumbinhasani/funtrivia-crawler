{"id": "218071", "name": "Hardest Bad, Bad, Bad: More Movie Villains Trivia Quiz | Movies | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", " Something in Common", "Movie Villains"], "questions": [{"text": "We have two villains for the price of one here.  Which movie features two evil fellows, one the Nazi henchman named Colonel Dietrich, and the other a French archaeologist named Dr. Rene Belloq?", "correct": "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "options": ["Judgment at Nuremburg", "Casablanca", "The Great Dictator"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark.\n\n\tFans of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' probably took a few days to shake the nightmarish vision of the creepy Colonel Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) from their minds.  Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) is more subtle, but just as creepy if one really considers his character.  Together, they create quite a formidable challenge for our hero, Indiana Jones, who is in a race against these Nazi hirelings to discover the mysterious Ark of the Covenant. \n"}, {"text": "Everyone always talks about 'Darth Vader this' and 'Darth Vader that' when they think of 'Star Wars' baddies.  Let us not forget this chap, though, the insidious emperor who pulls Darth Vader's strings.  What is his name?", "correct": "Palpatine", "options": ["Tarken", "Dooku", "Dodonna"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPalpatine.\n\n\tBeginning his career as a mere evil senator, Palpatine quickly moves up the ranks to emperor during the second 'Star Wars' trilogy.  By the film 'The Return of the Jedi', the shrivelled Palpatine has full control of his galactic empire and exploits his power in an attempt to destroy Luke Skywalker and his 'pitiful rebel alliance'. \n"}, {"text": "The unforgettable question 'Is it safe?' is asked over and over by the demonic Dr. Szell in the movie 'Marathon Man' of 1976.  Who ably plays this wicked Nazi in that anxiety-inducing film? ", "correct": "Laurence Olivier", "options": ["Robert Shaw", "Michael Caine", "John Gielgud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLaurence Olivier.\n\n\tWow, talk about a cure for ever wanting to go to the dentist again, just watch 'Marathon Man'.  Dustin Hoffman stars as the unwitting Thomas 'Babe' Levy, the object of Dr. Szell's torture methods.  John Schlesinger directs this thriller. \n"}, {"text": "Alex De Large, a young man completely bereft of any social conscience, is the main character in the 1971 dystopian classic 'A Clockwork Orange'.  Who directs this frightening but also darkly funny film?", "correct": "Stanley Kubrick", "options": ["Peter Bogdanovich", "Sidney Lumet", "John Carpenter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStanley Kubrick.\n\n\tStanley Kubrick squeezes every inch of evil he possibly can out of actor Malcolm McDowell who portrays Alex in this movie based on the Anthony Burgess novel.  Interestingly, Alex is both villain and victim in this film that forces the viewer to consider how and why punishment is meted out. \n"}, {"text": "Which actor, most famous for having appeared as a long-time game show host, portrayed the dastardly Killian in the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle 'The Running Man'?", "correct": "Richard Dawson", "options": ["Pat Sajak", "Wink Martindale", "Chuck Woolery"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRichard Dawson.\n\n\tRichard Dawson takes a surprise turn as the villain in this corny but reasonably entertaining movie about a futuristic game show that puts its contestant's lives on the line.  The film is based on a Stephen King novel, and also features Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown as superbaddies. \n"}, {"text": "Perhaps the biggest bad guy of them all, the reptilian Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is the chief antagonist (and assistant) to Clarice Starling in the 1991 horror-thriller 'The Silence of the Lambs'.  Upon whose book was this film based?", "correct": "Thomas Harris", "options": ["Stephen King", "Bram Stoker", "Anne Rice"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThomas Harris.\n\n\tHas anyone ever succeeded in scaring audiences, while at the same time gaining their sympathy, like Anthony Hopkins in his 1991 performance as Hannibal Lecter?  Naturally, Hopkins won an Academy Award for his performance, as did Jodie Foster in her performance as the vulnerable yet strong-willed FBI agent, Clarice Starling.  Ted Levine is also very spooky as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb in this film masterpiece directed by Jonathan Demme. \n"}, {"text": "One of the all-time wicked performances was submitted by which actress as the seemingly unassuming but ultimately scheming and shameless Eve Harrington in 'All About Eve'.  Which actress successfully held her own opposite Bette Davis as the artful title character in the film?", "correct": "Anne Baxter", "options": ["Vera Miles", "Claudette Colbert", "Carole Lombard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnne Baxter.\n\n\tAnne Baxter, who made a living playing shady women such as Sophie in 'The Razor's Edge' and Nefretiri in 'The Ten Commandments', seemed right at home as the guileful Eve in this 1950 classic.  Some say she even upstaged Bette Davis, fulfilling her character Eve's ultimate goal! \n"}, {"text": "Nothing is more frightful than an evil man with absolute power.  Such is precisely the case for Amon Goeth, a Nazi commandant played by Ralph Fiennes, in which beautifully made film?", "correct": "Schindler's List", "options": ["Stalag 17", "The Pianist", "The Diary of Anne Frank"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSchindler's List.\n\n\tAmon Goeth seems completely indifferent to those people suffering under his watch in the Nazi concentration camp at Krakow.  Ralph Fiennes is able to imbue a sense of callousness to this character that completely repels the viewer.  At the same time, however, there is something sadly coldly human remaining in Goeth that makes one realize that individuals such as him could emerge in any society, given the right conditions. \n"}, {"text": "The stern, ruthless Captain Bligh has been the object of many Hollywood portrayals over the years.  Which of these actors did not play the grim-faced Captain in a version of the classic story about the mutiny on the ship HMAV Bounty?", "correct": "Spencer Tracy", "options": ["Charles Laughton", "Anthony Hopkins", "Trevor Howard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpencer Tracy.\n\n\tIn the 1935 film 'Mutiny on the Bounty', Charles Laughton took his turn as the steely-eyed Captain.  Trevor Howard appeared as the Rhadamanthine Bligh in the 1962 version of the same title.  Anthony Hopkins also appeared as the draconian Captain in the 1984 version of the classic story, entitled 'The Bounty'. \n"}, {"text": "Another bad guy characterized by his insensate evil is the king of vampires, Count Dracula.  Many actors have had the opportunity to play this diabolical fiend, but who portrayed this popular character of European legend in the original 1931 classic entitled 'Dracula'?", "correct": "Bela Lugosi", "options": ["Lon Chaney Jr.", "John Carradine", "Boris Karloff"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBela Lugosi.\n\n\tIn the minds of many, Bela Lugosi will always be the quintessential Dracula.  Tod Browning directed Lugosi in the 1931 version.  Though Lugosi's version is probably best known, actor Christopher Lee has portrayed Dracula the most times of any actor, with a total of 10 films under his belt portraying the lord of vampires.\r I hope you have enjoyed this quiz, thank you for playing! \n"}]}
