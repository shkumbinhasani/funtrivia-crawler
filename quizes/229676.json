How long, in miles, does this marathon span? ", "correct": "120 miles", "options": ["60 miles", "52 miles", "104 miles"], "explanation": "\n\n\n120 miles.\n\n\tCatherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) mentions this number to Gil Grissom (William Petersen) in the teaser of the episode.  Apparently, their team consists of 20 CSI's sharing the 120-mile run. \n"}, {"text": "Two of the police officers in town for the marathon in \"Dead Ringer\" wind up being shot dead in a hotel room.  The man and woman in question were both married, though not to each other.  Who shot them dead?", "correct": "His wife", "options": ["Both", "Her husband", "Neither"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis wife.\n\n\tThe wife of Manny Senteno walked in on what she thought was a romantic encounter between her husband and his colleague, a female cop named Patricia Fielding.  She fatally shot the two of them.  Unfortunately, as Catherine informs her, Mrs. Senteno shot the wrong woman:  Manny was cheating on her with a different woman entirely.  Patricia Fielding and Manny were just friends! \n"}, {"text": "Episode 20, \"Turn of the Screws\", centers around a rollercoaster accident that results in the death of several people.  Where did the rollercoaster land once it launched free of its track?", "correct": "In the parking lot of the amusement park", "options": ["At the entrance of a concession stand", "In the middle of the ferris wheel", "Atop the merry-go-round"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the parking lot of the amusement park.\n\n\tThe rollercoaster, called \"Pharaoh's Fever\", left the confines of the amusement park completely, crashing directly on top of a red car in the parking lot.  Six people died in the accident. \n"}, {"text": "Gil Grissom (William Petersen) throws out yet another somewhat obscure quote in \"Turn of the Screws\", this time while looking for evidence with about half of his crew.  The quote is as follows:  \"There are three things in human life that are important. The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.\"  Which author is he quoting?", "correct": "Henry James", "options": ["William Shakespeare", "James Thurber", "George Bernard Shaw"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHenry James.\n\n\tHenry James, whose classic gothic tale \"The Turn of the Screw\" is the obvious inspiration for the title of this episode, is the author being quoted by Grissom in this scene. \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"Turn of the Screws\", Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) investigate the murder of a 13-year-old named Tessa Press.  Who killed her?", "correct": "her mother", "options": ["a male classmate", "her mother's boyfriend", "a complete stranger"], "explanation": "\n\n\nher mother.\n\n\tRaina Press murdered her own daughter because she felt that Tessa was trying to steal her boyfriend.  A sample of her sicko dialogue: \"I bought Tessa a bus pass, and that little slut still gets my guy to pick her up after school.\"  If only these things happened exclusively in the realm of fiction... \n"}, {"text": "In episode 22, \"No More Bets\", we meet a couple of guys who come up with a pretty clever way of cheating a casino out of money...and eventually end up dead.  At what game do they cheat?", "correct": "roulette", "options": ["craps", "poker", "blackjack"], "explanation": "\n\n\nroulette.\n\n\tThrough a complicated system (including a computer in a shoe, operated by one of the men's toes!), three young men manage to cheat at roulette and win over $400,000. \n"}, {"text": "The casino that has been ripped off in \"No More Bets\" is owned by recurring character Sam Braun (Scott Wilson).  \nTrue or False:  Sam did not murder either of the men killed in this episode.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tThe man who killed the young scammers is Joe Greene, an old enemy of Sam Braun's who tried to frame Braun for the double homicide.  Sam skates away scot free yet again! \n"}, {"text": "In the \"B\" story of \"No More Bets\", Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) learns that Gil Grissom has recommended Nick Stokes (George Eads) for the \"Key CSI\" position instead of her.  When she asks Grissom why he apparently thought that Nick was the best candidate for the promotion, what is Grissom's response?", "correct": "\"Because he didn't care whether he got the job or not.\"", "options": ["\"Because he's better than you are.\"", "\"Because I'm not in love with Nick.\"", "\"Because Nick understands that a life outside of this lab is a requirement of the job.\""], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Because he didn't care whether he got the job or not.\"\n\n\tIn the end, it turns out to be a moot point:  due to budget cuts, the \"Key CSI\" position is eliminated.  Sara, though, clearly remains upset that Nick was chosen \"over\" her. \n"}, {"text": "In episode 23, \"Bloodlines\", a man named Todd Coombs (George Newbern) is accused of rape and murder.  What does he do for a living?", "correct": "He is a psychiatrist.", "options": ["He is a security guard.", "He is an auto mechanic.", "He is a pit boss at a casino."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe is a psychiatrist.\n\n\tTodd has brothers who hold some of the other jobs listed as possible answers, but Todd himself is a psychiatrist.  We even see him being arrested in the middle of a session with a patient. \n"}, {"text": "Ever the geek, Gil Grissom compares suspect Todd Coombs to a mythological creature near the end of the episode.  Which one?", "correct": "chimera", "options": ["griffin", "basilisk", "hydra"], "explanation": "\n\n\nchimera.\n\n\tTodd Coombs has a unique body chemistry that baffles the CSI team for most of this episode.  Thanks to the fact that he \"absorbed\" an unborn twin while he was still in the womb, Dr. Coombs actually has two separate and distinct DNA patterns, which is why his original DNA tests only \"half-matched\" the evidence recovered from the rape victim; this exonerated him, and sent Grissom's team looking for one of Todd's numerous brothers.\r Grissom finally figures it out, though, and compares Todd to a chimera, a mythological creature that, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, is \"a fire-breathing [monster] in Greek mythology having a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail\", or \"an imaginary monster compounded of incongruous parts\".  This term has also, in science, come to refer to exactly what Todd is:  an organism exhibiting two or more distinct genetic signatures. \r And that wraps it up for season four.  Season five quizzes will be coming soon, so don't go away! \n"}]}
