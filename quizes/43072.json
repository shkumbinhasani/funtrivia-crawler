{"id": "43072", "name": "Vectors Quiz | Math | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Science Trivia", "Math", "Specific Math Topics"], "questions": [{"text": "What are the two basic characteristics of a vector?", "correct": "magnitude and direction", "options": ["curvature and sign (positive or negative)", "magnitude and sign (positive or negative)", "curvature and direction"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmagnitude and direction.\n\n\tA scalar quantity, which has only size, is any ordinary number like 13 or -2. A vector would be something like 15 mph going NNE, or 3 in the direction of 85 degrees above the horizontal. The magnitude of a vector is an absolute value: it's never negative. \n"}, {"text": "Vectors are often split into two or more orthogonal components. What is true of these components in relation to each other?", "correct": "They are perpendicular.", "options": ["They are antiparallel.", "They are the same magnitude.", "They are the same curvature."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThey are perpendicular.\n\n\tThe vector itself can be thought of as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the two legs are the components. In Cartesian coordinates, a vector is expressed in terms of its {coordinates;} a size-2 vector in the y-direction would be (0,2) -- 0 directed along the x-axis and 2 directed along the y-axis. \n"}, {"text": "Where 'a' is the length of the vector and 'B' is the angle it makes with the x-axis, what is the length of its component along the x-axis?", "correct": "a cosB", "options": ["a tanB", "a sinB", "B cosa"], "explanation": "\n\n\na cosB.\n\n\tThis comes from basic trigonometry. The length of the component along the y-axis would be a*sinB. \n"}, {"text": "How are vectors represented graphically?", "correct": "As arrows", "options": ["As straight lines", "As oriented curves", "As squiggly lines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAs arrows.\n\n\tThis method allows both magnitude (the length of the arrow) and direction to be represented. \n"}, {"text": "What is a 'unit vector'?", "correct": "a vector with a magnitude of 1", "options": ["a vector in the horizontal direction", "a vector with uniform curvature (like an arc of a circle)", "equal to one one-thousandth of a kilovector"], "explanation": "\n\n\na vector with a magnitude of 1.\n\n\tUnit vectors are used to define direction. The three most commonly used are i, j, and k, defining the directions of the x, y, and z axes, respectively. \n"}, {"text": "How do you add two vectors graphically?", "correct": "Place them head-to-tail and draw the addition vector from the tail of one to the head of the other.", "options": ["This can't be done; vectors can only be added algebraically.", "Place them head-to-tail and draw the addition vector from the head of one to the tail of the other.", "Place them tail-to-tail and draw the addition vector connecting the two heads."], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlace them head-to-tail and draw the addition vector from the tail of one to the head of the other.\n\n\tRemember, the direction of the addition vector is as important as its length. The addition of two vectors is equivalent to traveling the vectors consecutively: you eventually reach the same place relative to your starting point. \n"}, {"text": "How do you add two vectors algebraically?", "correct": "Break the vectors into components. Then add x-components, y-components, etc, algebraically.", "options": ["Break the vectors into components, then add the lengths of all of them together.", "This can't be done; vectors can only be added graphically.", "Add each of the characteristics from Q1."], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreak the vectors into components. Then add x-components, y-components, etc, algebraically.\n\n\tThis method is also called component addition. Analysis reveals that this method is mathematically equivalent to the graphical method. \n"}, {"text": "The norm of a vector, found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the components, is equal to what quantity?", "correct": "magnitude", "options": ["angle with respect to horizontal", "degree of curvature", "average component"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmagnitude.\n\n\tThe norm of vector r is often indicated by enclosing r in absolute-value signs. A Euclidean norm is found by the method described above - you'll encounter other varieties of norms as you progress in math and physics, but they're all equal to the magnitude. \n"}, {"text": "The dot product is used to multiply two vectors for a scalar result. When you dot vectors r and s, with angle Q between them, the answer is equal to which of the following values?", "correct": "(norm of r) (norm of s) (cosQ)", "options": ["(norm of r) (norm of s) (sinQ)", "(norm of r) (norm of s) (tanQ)", "Qcos((norm of r) (norm of s))"], "explanation": "\n\n\n(norm of r) (norm of s) (cosQ).\n\n\tAnother way to calculate the dot product is by multiplying the x-components by each other, the y-components by each other, and so on -- then you add all the products. It's interesting to note that the dot product of any two perpendicular vectors is zero. \n"}, {"text": "The cross product is a way of multiplying two vectors for a result that is a vector. What geometrical quantity does its length represent?", "correct": "area of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors", "options": ["statistical mean of the two vectors", "area of the triangle defined by the two vectors", "area of the circle sector defined by the two vectors"], "explanation": "\n\n\narea of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors.\n\n\tThe cross product is defined only in three dimensions and higher, since that vector is always perpendicular to both the original two vectors. So if you drew two vectors on a sheet of paper and took their cross product, the resultant would either rise out of or sink into the page. The magnitude has the value (magnitude of r)(magnitude of s)(sinQ). \n"}]}
