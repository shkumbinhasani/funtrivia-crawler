The Moabite Stone gives us much of the information we know about Moab today.

The weight is usually made of metal or stone. It was used in building to make sure the walls were straight. In Amos, the vision may have signaled that Israel was built straight but had turned from God (i.e. it was no longer straight) and therefore would be destroyed. \n"}, {"text": "What is the last word in Amos in the King James Version?", "correct": "God", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGod.\n\n\tAmos 9:15 \"And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.\"\r Thank you for taking my quiz.
