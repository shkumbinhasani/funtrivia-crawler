What phrase was used for the eventual return of said half of the universe?", "correct": "The Blip", "options": ["The Snapback", "The Unsnap", "The Refresh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blip.\n\n\tIn the ruins of Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrive to find the community rebuilding after a recent mysterious cyclone that many believe to have seen the appearance of a face upon.  They have no reason to believe that their call to action is any sort of sign of something worse on the horizon, but their arrival is quickly interrupted by the appearance of a hero and a villain, the latter being an earthen creature that rises from the ground to destroy their vehicle.\r The students of Midtown Technical High School, however, are none the wiser.  As the world recovers from the events of Thanos' apocalypse, they mourn the fallen heroes of the Avengers and pick up the pieces left behind.  If Thanos' actions were known as 'The Snap', the return of half the universe, five years later, was known as 'The Blip'.  All those returned from their vanishing had come back unaged despite the time change, and as such, Midtown Tech decided to restart the school year.  Now, it's the end of that year, and there's a lot to think about as the students move on to a new phase of their lives.\r And with that, Peter Parker has a plan. \n"}, {"text": "To which destination do Peter and his class travel first?", "correct": "Venice", "options": ["Paris", "Rome", "Berlin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVenice.\n\n\tPeter, heading off to Europe with his classmates for summer vacation, plans to take the opportunity to spend time getting closer to MJ (and that plan is pretty elaborate, tracking several smaller opportunities to express himself before revealing his true feelings atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris).  His best friend, Ned, suggests not doing any of it.  They can be bachelors in Europe if he doesn't.\r In the meantime, Peter has been heading to charity galas as Spider-Man.  Working at a Salvation Army function with his Aunt May, he's met by Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's former bodyguard, who comes bearing a giant novelty cheque from Pepper Potts and the news that Peter is likely to be called by Nick Fury.  He's not wrong; the call comes almost immediately.  Peter decides to ghost Nick Fury, sending him to voicemail while the crowd of news reporters outside ask him heavy questions about the future of The Avengers.\r But there's more to worry about-- Peter has to pack for his trip.  May suggests he pack his suit, just in case, but he avoids it. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these does Peter buy for MJ during the trip?", "correct": "A glass necklace", "options": ["Flowers", "A coffee", "A greeting card"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA glass necklace.\n\n\tPeter's class flies from New York to Venice and the flight, while uneventful for Peter, leads to some interesting dynamics.  Besides MJ being sat next to a rival for her affections (Brad), Ned and Betty, another classmate, find out that they have a lot in common.  Things only get weirder when Peter finds out that May packed his Spider-Man costume in his luggage.\r While his classmates do some sightseeing, Peter buys a glass necklace from a local shop, planning to give it to MJ as part of his plan.  As the two of them walk around however, something terrible happens-- an elemental creature emerges from the canals and begins to destroy the city.  Peter, still keeping his abilities a secret, has no choice but to hide himself as a hero - none other than the same man who met Nick Fury and Maria Hill in Mexico, shows up to fight.  When the threat is abated, the hero leaves without a word.  Later that evening, Parker and his classmates, watching the Italian news, misunderstand that his name might be 'Mysterio', the Italian word for mystery. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these Elementals, according to Quentin, was responsible for destroying his world, Earth-833?", "correct": "Fire", "options": ["Air", "Earth", "Water"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFire.\n\n\tAs the class prepares to visit Paris as the next stop on their itinerary, Peter and Ned head up to their room only to find Nick Fury waiting for them (having been unable to contact Parker).  While Ned is incapacitated by a tranquilizer, Fury lays out the issues at hand.  Between the events in Mexico, Morocco, and now Venice, there's clearly a pattern.  Fury also notes, in a late-night boat ride through the Venice canals, that Tony Stark left items to be handed off to Parker in the event of his death, the most notable of these being a pair of high-tech glasses.\r When the pair reach their destination, a secret base hidden in a cavernous tunnel, Parker is introduced to Maria Hill and Quentin Beck, the man who his classmates had been calling 'Mysterio'.  He reveals himself to be from another world and Fury indicates that while Beck is from Earth, he's from another alternate version of Earth.  While Peter is on Earth-616, Beck is from Earth-833.  The multiverse exists.\r Beck explains that what they're up against are beings made from the primal elements-- air, water, fire, and earth.  The myths of the olden eras were real.  The Elementals destroyed Beck's world, but they have arrived on Earth-616 and only the fire Elemental remains, the one that destroyed Earth-833.  Maria has discovered that the fire Elemental will be in Prague in forty-eight hours and it's Peter's job to go there.  Peter asks for some reconsideration; if his class finds out he's Spider-Man, the whole world won't be long to follow.  Fury sends him back to his summer vacation, but the next morning, Peter realizes he's hijacked the trip; his class is put on a bus to Prague instead of a train to Paris. \n"}, {"text": "What is the acronym attributed to Tony Stark's high-tech glasses?", "correct": "E.D.I.T.H.", "options": ["V.I.S.I.O.N.", "F.R.I.D.A.Y.", "J.A.R.V.I.S."], "explanation": "\n\n\nE.D.I.T.H.\n\n\tRiding the bus through Austria, Peter tries Stark's glasses on for the first time and, reading a note, boots up E.D.I.T.H., Tony Stark's augmented reality security and defence system.  E.D.I.T.H., which stands for 'Even Dead I'm The Hero', has access to the Stark global security network.  Its capabilities are immediately apparent as he can read his classmates' text messages.  An unfortunate misunderstanding and a compromising photo lead Parker to accidentally misuse E.D.I.T.H.'s capabilities to nearly kill one of his classmates.  Fortunately, he's able to solve the issue with some creative thinking.\r Arriving in Prague, the class checks into their five-star hotel and Peter is quickly distracted.  Fury, Hill, and Beck, already set up in a new base in the city, brief a frustrated Parker on the situation at hand and prepare for the Elemental's appearance. \n"}, {"text": "To prevent his classmates from encountering the fire Elemental, Peter manages to trick them into staying put in which of these locations?", "correct": "Opera house", "options": ["Dance club", "Museum", "Movie theatre"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOpera house.\n\n\tThe entire battle situation leads to an argument between Parker and Fury, the latter of whom is frustrated by the circumstances post-Blip and the fact that Stark bestowed a multi-billion dollar AI system to Spider-Man, but the concern has to go by the wayside.  Beck later confides in Parker that while he deserves his vacation as such a young hero, there's clearly more at stake, especially since his classmates are in town.\r Using E.D.I.T.H., Parker manages to get his classmates off the streets and into a four-hour opera performance just in time for him to slip away and help Mysterio, but he doesn't notice as MJ, Ned, and Betty sneak off after him (and into the Festival of Lights raging on outside).  The Elemental strikes right in the midst of the festivities and only with their combined powers are Parker and Beck able to bring down the world-ending foe.  Beck, punching through the creature and striking it from within, blasts it to smithereens and barely survives.\r Following the fight, Fury asks Beck and Parker to join himself and Hill in Berlin to discuss the start of a new Avenger-esque squad.  The world needs it; the Elemental won't be the last threat they face.\r Beck invites Peter to a nearby bar to celebrate over a drink and it's there that Beck asks Peter what he wants.  Peter is candid about his wants-- the trip, the girl, the life.  When Peter puts on the E.D.I.T.H. glasses, he realizes that Beck might be the right person to be the next Tony Stark.  He happily hands over the glasses; it's the choice he thinks Stark intended for him to make.  He transfers control and departs to rejoin his class, but the minute he leaves the bar, Beck ends the charade and turns off the holograms that have been surrounding them the whole time. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these reveals to Peter and MJ that Quentin Beck is the mastermind behind the Elementals?", "correct": "A projector", "options": ["A scrap of clothing", "A drone", "A news report"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA projector.\n\n\tWhen Beck brings down the holograms, he's left in the bar with a smaller crowd, but a crowd nonetheless.  He removes the bulk of his costume to announce a toast celebrating the death of their former boss, Tony Stark, who he and his entourage felt was not fit to wield his technologies.  Tony took his holographic tech (which he gave the acronym B.A.R.F.) and fired Beck from Stark Industries, alleging him to be unstable.  Every member of his group managed to sort out a part of the plan, and it would finally be time for the little guy to rise.  Mysterio would stand for that.\r Peter returns to the hotel to find that the class is planning to head home what with all of the evildoer sightings along their itinerary.  Peter and MJ manage to get some time alone and head off together to sight-see.  Peter nearly admits how much he likes her, but this gets put on the back burner when she reveals she guessed he was Spider-Man.  After all, she was there for Washington D.C...and Venice...and Prague.  She also nabbed a piece of machinery covered in webs, but before they can dig deeper into that, the item bursts to life, revealing a projection of a smoky air Elemental on the Charles Bridge.  And in that projection is none other than Mysterio, fighting off that 'threat'.\r Beck, meanwhile, is in the studio using E.D.I.T.H.'s drones to map out the next Avengers-level threat.  The next target: London.  He discovers that one of the drones is missing a projector and, with E.D.I.T.H. in-hand, finds out that it's in Parker's possession. \n"}, {"text": "During a fight in Berlin, Peter is hit by which of these?", "correct": "A train", "options": ["A bus", "A baseball bat", "A bullet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA train.\n\n\tPeter arrives in Berlin by the next day and standing in front of the train station he's met by Nick Fury, who rolls up in a nondescript vehicle.  When they're in a secure room of the Europol building, Fury and Hill ask him to explain himself, so Parker spills the beans.  He has the projector and he knows Beck's plan.  The only problem is that Parker doesn't realize Beck knows, and it only takes a few moments for the charade to break down as Peter finds himself in a construction site bolstered by holograms.  The fight forces Peter into environments he can't trust, facing off against terrifying visions he struggles to comprehend, but it comes to an end when Nick Fury puts a bullet into Quentin's back.\r While Fury's authorities circle the fallen Mysterio, Fury approaches Parker and asks for insight into who else could be in danger-- anyone who knew of Beck's plot-- and Peter spills the beans, noting that MJ and Ned know, and possibly Betty.  It turns out, however, that Fury isn't there; Beck orchestrated his death in the vision.  Beck causes Peter to misstep onto some train tracks where he is promptly hit by a high-speed train, and immediately after he asks E.D.I.T.H. to reroute Peter's class to London. \n"}, {"text": "Where are MJ and the rest of Peter's class when Beck attacks them in London?", "correct": "The Tower Bridge", "options": ["The London Eye", "Piccadilly Circus", "Big Ben"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Tower Bridge.\n\n\tPeter manages to survive the train and stows away inside before passing out.  He wakes up in a holding cell in the Netherlands and breaks out with minimal effort.  He has to get to London, after all.  He borrows a phone off a Dutch food-seller and phones Happy asking for a way out of (what turns out to be) the town of Broek Op Langedijk.  When Happy arrives, he's able to prove he is who he appears to be.  The two of them commiserate, but there's little time to waste.\r Peter's class arrives in London and boards a double-decker bus bound for the Tower Bridge as Fury and Hill set up camp in the city.  Beck arrives at their signal to perform a perimeter sweep but the truth is that he's not there; he's near the Thames orchestrating his plan, an Avengers-level threat, an amalgamation of the four Elementals.  Beck warns Fury to leave, but Fury, who received a coded message from Happy en route, stands his ground. \n"}, {"text": "Peter Parker makes it back to New York City, but who reveals his identity to the world upon his return?", "correct": "J. Jonah Jameson", "options": ["Happy Hogan", "Brad", "Nick Fury"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJ. Jonah Jameson\n\n\tPeter descends into the manufactured Maelstrom and begins taking down E.D.I.T.H.'s drones from within while Maria Hill ascends to the top of the shard with a massive weapon in tow.  Beck looks into the droneworks to find Peter breaking things down and has no choice but to get his hands dirty.  He temporarily brings Peter down and decides to cut the light-show to reveal the drones.  Happy lands the Stark Jet to collect MJ and the others but Beck, spotting it landing near Potter's Field Park, blasts it to bits.  He decides to chase after the kids (and into the vault containing the Crown Jewels) while sending the drones after Spider-Man.\r It takes a colossal amount of effort, especially after he loses his webslinging devices, but Peter reaches Beck's vantage point atop the bridge and fights him directly.  Beck, loaded with contingencies, plunges Peter into a drone-fuelled holographic vision, but Peter is able to use his senses and intuition to fight back through the fakery.  Beck, unhinged, orders E.D.I.T.H.'s drones to attack, even with him in close proximity, and he accidentally gets himself shot by the machines.  Peter approaches and asks for the glasses, fully knowing that it's yet another illusion.  When he reaches out to the side, he's able to prevent Beck from putting a bullet in his head.  He takes back the glasses, logs back into E.D.I.T.H., and cancels the drones.  Beck dies, but not before warning Peter that people need to believe...and they'll believe anything.\r From a warehouse, one of Beck's associates absconds with the data for the Elementals.\r Peter and MJ reunite on the Tower Bridge and she reveals that Happy gave her the necklace...but it broke in the rush away from the danger.  He apologizes for not being able to go through with his plan, but it doesn't matter; the two of them share a few kisses on the bridge before splitting off to deal with what happened.  They head back to New York together, flying back to Newark.  Peter wonders if anyone else figured out the truth and MJ reassures him that his cover hasn't been blown.  Once they start dating, however, things might change.\r After taking MJ on a web-slinging tour of New York City, he spots himself on the news on the screen at Madison Square Gardens.  Doctored footage provided from E.D.I.T.H.'s drones made its way to TheDailyBugle.net and J. Jonah Jameson has the scoop.  Oh yeah, and Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker. \n"}]}
