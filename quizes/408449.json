In 1948, the Globetrotters defeated the all-white Minneapolis Lakers showing that African Americans could compete against the best the NBA had to offer. That game, along with the fact that the EPBL was becoming increasingly integrated and remaining popular motivated the NBA to begin adding black players. \n"}, {"text": "In 1951 a point shaving scandal rocked the collegiate basketball world.
