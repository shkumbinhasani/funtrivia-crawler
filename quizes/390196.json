{"id": "390196", "name": "\"Will the Wise\" Trivia Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television Q-T", "Stranger Things"], "questions": [{"text": "Where do Joyce and the boys find Will when he's captured by the beast?", "correct": "In the field at school", "options": ["In his house", "In the forest", "In the gymnasium at school"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the field at school.\n\n\tJoyce drives recklessly to the school to retrieve Will, but most of the kids and staff have already left.  She checks the AV club room only to find Dustin and Max still searching.  Lucas informs them all that Will's out in the field.  He's standing there having what Mike says is 'another episode'.  The creature on the other side finally ceases its assault on his body.\rJoyce takes Will home while the others stay back and talk about how things are getting worse.  At home, Joyce asks Will to remember what happened, but he can't, it seems.  She doesn't really believe him though.  She shows Will the shape she drew from the video and assures him that he believes bad things are still happening and he finally admits that it's real.  He doesn't know what it wants, but it got him.  He can still feel it. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper has no choice but to ground Eleven, banning her from Eggos and which of these luxuries?", "correct": "Television", "options": ["Sunlight", "Radio", "Books"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTelevision.\n\n\tEleven returns to the cabin after nightfall to find Hopped waiting out front for her.  The argument is almost immediate and Hopper insists she tell the truth because the mother and her child saw her earlier and that put them at serious risk.  Eleven argues that Hopper promised her that something would change, but nothing ever does, and Hopper says that if she can't follow his rules, then she'll never learn. For defying him, he grounds her, throwing out her Eggos and banning them for a week, and then escalating his punishment when she continues to act out, eventually making the television inoperable. Eleven's tantrum goes one step further when she heads to her room, screams, and blows out the windows of the cabin. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce takes Will's temperature, discovering he's running a high fever.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThe next day, Nancy tells her family she's planning to go to Stacey's for a slumber party for the night.  Really, she's heading out with Jonathan to enact their plan together.\rJoyce ends up waking up and trying to contact Hopper at the police station but he's late to arrive.  Will wakes up still feeling bad, but when Joyce puts a thermometer in his mouth she finds that he's abnormally cold.  She runs a bath for him to help.\rDustin, meanwhile, feeds Dart before getting ready to head to school  When he arrives, he finds Lucas, Mike, and Max still looking for Dart.  Will never makes it for a lesson about natural fight or flight reactions.\rWill is actually at home dreading getting into the bath.  He tells his mother it's too hot but Joyce says they need to get his temperature back up.  Will gives a firm 'no' though, saying that 'he likes it cold'. \n"}, {"text": "Joyce, worried about Will, calls who of these people eight times?", "correct": "Hopper", "options": ["Mrs. Wheeler", "Dr. Owens", "Bob"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHopper.\n\n\tHopper wakes up in the morning and finishes covering the windows of the cabin with wood.  He apologizes to Eleven through her door in his own way, saying he wants the place cleaned when he gets back so that he'll reconsider fixing the television.  When Hopper gets to his radio in his truck, he finds out that Joyce has called the station eight times.\rAt school, Steve continues to fight with Billy during a game of basketball.  In the showers, he finds out that Nancy has skipped the day with Jonathan, as per rumours going around.\rJonathan and Nancy are actually at the park, prepared for their talk with Barb's mother.  The two of them are a bit leery though, since anyone could be a government agent watching them.  Nancy suggests they leave, and they rush to Jonathan's vehicle and hop in but it won't start.  They find themselves surrounded and a man knocks on their window and offers a ride. \n"}, {"text": "Will tells Hopper and Joyce that the creature inside him has allowed him to see which of these?", "correct": "Memories", "options": ["The Upside-Down", "New colours", "Life forces"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMemories.\n\n\tHobber arrives at the Byers household to find the front door open and Joyce tells him to leave it that way.  They check in on Will who's sitting up in his room with the window open and his shirt off because he wants it cold.  Hopper asks if the thing is talking to him, but Will says that he just knows things now; it's like old memories, but they aren't his memories.  They seem to be happening all at once, but in the present.  Joyce asks Will to draw what he sees, and he immediately takes to the idea.\rThe phone, meanwhile, rings in the kitchen and it turns out to be Mike who, with the guys, can't seem to find out where Will is.  He tells them to talk in the AV room, but without Max, and they talk about the shadow creature and True Sight.  Mike says he'll go visit Will and see what's wrong, but the others have to find Dart because he could be what they need to help Will. \n"}, {"text": "Eleven finds a crawlspace full of boxes under Hopper's cabin.  She reads through one with which label?", "correct": "Hawkins Lab", "options": ["Washington D.C.", "Atlantis", "Area 51"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHawkins Lab.\n\n\tAfter Hopper leaves, Eleven immediately tries to work at fixing the television but finds that she can't, so she cleans up a bit instead, starting with righting a bookcase she knocked over and sweeping up some glass.  Doing this though, she locates a trapdoor beneath the cabin and a crawlspace underneath containing a number of boxes, one of which is labeled 'Hawkins Lab'.  Inside are files, so she starts sifting through them.\rAt the lab, Jonathan and Nancy are met in an interrogation room by Dr. Owens and they're asked to take a walk.  He admits that his predecessors made a lot of mistakes, but he's there to fix them.  They enter the basement lab and see the entrance to the Upside-Down and he says they can't get rid of their mistakes necessarily, but they can keep them from spreading.  The more attention they bring to the mistakes, the more the enemies will know. \n"}, {"text": "Hopper deduces that Will, when asked to draw what he sees, is drawing which of these?", "correct": "Vines", "options": ["Lightning", "Tunnels", "Roots"], "explanation": "\n\n\nVines.\n\n\tAt home, Will continues to make his drawings, colouring abstract pictures that Joyce and Hopper can't seem to make heads or tails of.  Joyce is the one to figure out that the pictures connect though, and once they clear enough space to lay them out and piece together the puzzle, they can begin forming what it all is...and it turns out to be a bit of a mess, sprawling around the room like a labyrinth.  Joyce says it's not like the lighting Will saw in the Upside-Down since that was red, but Hopper theorizes he's drawing vines before rushing out of the house. \n"}, {"text": "Where does Hopper decide to begin digging?", "correct": "Beneath a pumpkin patch", "options": ["Next to the lab", "In a forest", "Behind the Byers house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeneath a pumpkin patch.\n\n\tWhen the bell rings at school, Lucas tries to talk to Max but she continuously gives him the cold shoulder because he and the other guys keep leaving her out of their talks.  Lucas says there's things they can't tell her for her own safety and she decides she's out; she doesn't want to be friends anymore.  When Billy meets her at the car, he gives her grief about talking to Lucas and violently urges her to stay away from kids like him.\rHopper, meanwhile, grabs a shovel and heads out into one of the pumpkin patches to begin digging.\rEleven, meanwhile, continues to read through the Hawkins Lab box until she finds an article about Terry Ives, who claimed her daughter, Jane, was taken as a baby.  An attached photo shows Terry with her father. \n"}, {"text": "Based on what Eleven learns from the files she reads, what was her name before her time in the lab?", "correct": "Jane", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJane.\n\n\tEleven, knowing the television is beyond her repair, grabs a radio off a shelf and turns it on, changing to an empty frequency and blindfolding herself.  Using the image, she loses herself in the static and returns to the blackness to find Terry Ives seated in a rocking chair, mumbling to herself.  Terry opens her eyes and sees Eleven immediately, referring to her as Jane.  When Eleven grabs her though, she disappears, breaking into a cloud of dust.  She knows, though, that she is her mother.\rMike arrives at Will's house to be greeted at the door by Joyce, but she won't let him in...at least not until he mentions the shadow monster. \n"}, {"text": "Dart, as it is revealed, is a small Demogorgon.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tJonathan and Nancy are allowed to leave the lab after reclaiming Jonathan's now-functioning car.  When they get away from the lab, they drive out of Hawkins and Nancy pulls a tape recorder out of her back, revealing that she got everything she needed from the conversation with Dr. Owens to be able to bring down the lab altogether.\rDustin gets home and rushes to his room to find that Dart has done a couple things.  Firstly, he's escaped the terrarium.  Secondly, he's shed his skin.  Dustin ends up finding him in the corner of the room, biting into his cat; he turns around and lets out a horrible noise, revealing that he's a young Demogorgon.\rHopper keeps digging down, meanwhile, unearthing a large amount of soil in the field until he comes across something concerning...and gooey.  What he finds down there, when he pushes himself down into the hole he's created, is a long tunnel covered in vines, almost like in the Upside-Down. \n"}]}
