{"id": "187881", "name": "NBA Retired Jerseys Online Trivia | NBA Players | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "   NBA Players", "  NBA Names & Numbers"], "questions": [{"text": "The Boston Celtics have retired by far the most jersey numbers in NBA history.  Which player has his '00' (double zero) number retired by Boston?", "correct": "Robert Parish", "options": ["Kevin McHale", "Jo Jo White", "Bill Russell"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRobert Parish.\n\n\tRobert Parish, aka the Chief, wore the uniform number 00 during his NBA playing career.  This is quite an ironic number when one considers that he had played more NBA games than anyone else by the time of his retirement after the 2001-02 season.  He played a total of 21 NBA seasons! \n"}, {"text": "Besides the Utah Jazz, which other NBA team retired Pete Maravich's uniform number (#7)?", "correct": "New Orleans Hornets", "options": ["Miami Heat", "Atlanta Hawks", "San Antonio Spurs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew Orleans Hornets.\n\n\tThe Jazz retired Pete Maravich's uniform number in 1985, despite the fact that Maravich only played one season with the team in Utah.  Maravich was the first player in Jazz history after being traded to the New Orleans Jazz by Atlanta in 1974.  A native of Louisiana, Maravich played five seasons in New Orleans before the team moved to Utah after the 1978-79 season.  The Hornets decided to retire Maravich's number after moving from Charlotte to New Orleans in order to honor Pistol Pete's legacy. \n"}, {"text": "Which NBA team has retired the numbers of Elvin Hayes, Gus Johnson and Wes Unseld?", "correct": "Washington Wizards", "options": ["Atlanta Hawks", "Houston Rockets", "Seattle Supersonics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWashington Wizards.\n\n\tThe Wizards, formerly known as the Washington (and Baltimore) Bullets, have retired the numbers of Hayes, who wore number 11, Williams, who wore number 25, and Unself, who donned the number 41 jersey for the franchise. \n"}, {"text": "The Sacramento Kings and Charlotte Hornets (now in New Orleans) retired the #6.  For whom did both retire this number?", "correct": "The fans", "options": ["Ownership", "Coaches", "Broadcast team"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe fans.\n\n\tFor some reason, I find the idea of retiring the #6 (meaning, presumably, 'sixth man') for fans to be rather silly, but these two teams have done just that.  Especially ironic is the fact that the Charlotte Hornets retired this number for their fans only to have their fan base abandon them, eventually forcing the team's move to New Orleans.  Hopefully, the Charlotte Bobcats will have better luck! \n"}, {"text": "Clyde Drexler is one of the rare NBA players to have his number retired for two teams.  Type the name of either one of these teams in the blank.", "correct": "The Houston Rockets & Houston Rockets & Houston & Rockets & The Rockets & Portland Trailblazers & Portland & Trailblazers & Blazers & Trail Blazers & Portland Trail Blazers & The Trail Blazers & The Trailblazers & The Blazers & The Portland Trailblazers &", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets & Houston Rockets & Houston & Rockets & The Rockets & Portland Trailblazers & Portland & Trailblazers & Blazers & Trail Blazers & Portland Trail Blazers & The Trail Blazers & The Trailblazers & The Blazers & The Portland Trailblazers &.\n\n\tClyde 'The Glyde' Drexler has had his number 22 retired for both the Portland Trailblazers and the Houston Rockets.  Drexler led the Trailblazers to the NBA finals twice, and returned to the finals with the Houston Rockets in the 1994-95 season, winning his first and only NBA championship. \n"}, {"text": "Wilt Chamberlain has his number 13 retired by three NBA teams.  Which of these teams is not one of them?", "correct": "Boston Celtics", "options": ["Los Angeles Lakers", "Philadelphia 76ers", "Golden State Warriors"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoston Celtics.\n\n\tShame on you if you picked the Celtics!  \r Wilt played for five years with the warrior franchise, first in Philadelphia and later in San Francisco, before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers during the 1964-65 season.  After three full seasons with the 76ers, Chamberlain went to the Los Angeles Lakers and played there for his final five seasons.  He won championships with the 76ers and the Lakers, but surprisingly not with the Warriors. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these NBA franchises has had the longest stretch with no retired numbers?", "correct": "Los Angeles Clippers", "options": ["Minnesota Timberwolves", "Dallas Mavericks", "Atlanta Hawks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLos Angeles Clippers.\n\n\tSadly, though the Los Angeles Clippers have existed as a franchise since 1970 (first as the Buffalo Braves and later as the San Diego Clippers), they had no retired player numbers following the 2003-04 season.  It may be safe to say that the Clippers are the NBA's all-time most inept franchise.  The Minnesota Timberwolves, who began in the league in 1989, retired their first number in the year 2000, that of Malik Sealy who had passed away in a car accident.  The Mavericks have retired several numbers, including Rolando Blackman's #22.  The Hawks have retired Bob Pettit's #9, among others. \n"}, {"text": "Tom Chambers was among the NBA elite scorers, logging over 20,000 points during his career.  For which team is his #24 retired?", "correct": "Phoenix Suns", "options": ["Utah Jazz", "Seattle Supersonics", "Los Angeles Clippers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhoenix Suns.\n\n\tChambers played two seasons with the Clippers, five with the Supersonics, five with Phoenix and two with the Utah Jazz.

During his first two years with Phoenix Chambers hit his peak, averaging 25.7 and 27.5 points per game, respectively (1988-89, 1989-90 seasons). \n"}, {"text": "Oscar Robertson had his uniform number retired by two different NBA franchises.  His #14 has been retired by the Sacramento Kings franchise, but which other team has retired his number and what number would that be?", "correct": "Milwaukee Bucks (#1)", "options": ["Indiana Pacers (#24)", "Detroit Pistons (#6)", "Cleveland Cavaliers (#33)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (#1).\n\n\tThe Big O, Oscar Robertson, played for the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) for ten seasons before moving on to the Milwaukee Bucks for his last four seasons.  His career stats are simply amazing: 25.7 points per game, 9.5 assists per game and 7.5 rebounds per game.  Stats for steals were not counted during the first 13 years of his career, else he might be among the all-time leaders in that category as well.  Robertson averaged over 30 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists per game for each of his first five NBA seasons.  Michael Jordan, eat your heart out! \n"}, {"text": "Doug Moe was the long time basketball coach for the Denver Nuggets, has had his 'uniform number' retired by the team.  Which number is retired in his honor?", "correct": "432", "options": ["13", "0", "12"], "explanation": "\n\n\n432.\n\n\tThe number 432 has been reserved forever for Coach Moe.  It equals the number of regular season wins that Doug Moe had with the franchise.  His total record as head coach of Denver was 432-359.  If you think that's a ridiculous number to retire, consider Red Holtzman, former coach of the New York Knicks.  His 'number' 613 has been retired in honor of his total regular season wins with the Knicks franchise.\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it and will try some more of my stuff. \n"}]}
