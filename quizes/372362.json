In the first series it is referred to by the Bishop during the episode 'The Passion of Saint Tibulus' and again in the episode 'Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest' in which Father Ted makes the erroneous assumption that a visitor to Craggy Island is from the police and is trying to catch him out. \n"}, {"text": "Of the following, what was the main attraction at Funland, a travelling funfair, during its visit to Craggy Island in the first episode, 'Good Luck, Father Ted', at least as far as Father Dougal McGuire is concerned?

I wouldn't have much interest in that type of thing myself, to be honest\" says Father Ted Crilly to Dougal McGuire.\r\"They've got a spider baby; it's a kind of freak show thing.  It's got the body of a spider but it's actually a baby\" explains Father Dougal.\r\"How is it a baby?\" asks Father Ted, \"Does it have a nappy?\"\r\"No\" replies Father Dougal.\r\"Well... Does it have the head of a baby?\"\r\"No\"\r\"Well... If it looks like a spider and it doesn't actually gurgle at you or anything, how do you know it's actually a baby?\"\rFather Dougal ponders the question for a few moments and replies, \"They keep it in a pram!\" \n"}, {"text": "In this same episode and on arrival at Craggy Island, a television crew encounter one of the local characters, a man named Tom.

Tom also has a penchant for confessing to having committed a crime, usually using the line \"Father, I've killed a man\".  In a future episode, Tom agrees to help Father Ted with a rabbit problem. Father Ted believes that Tom will look after the rabbits in, as Father Ted puts it, \"a Julie Andrews sort of way\" when in actual fact Tom looks as if he will take care of the rabbits in \"an Al Pacino sort of way\" using a vice, a sledgehammer, a chainsaw and a samurai sword; no prizes for guessing how Tom intends to take care of business! \n"}, {"text": "What is the cause of the hospitalisation of Father Paul Stone in the episode, 'Entertaining Father Stone'?", "correct": "Lightning strike", "options": ["Spilling a pot of scalding hot tea", "A collision with a milk float", "Falling through a window"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLightning strike.\n\n\tFather Paul Stone is the world's most boring priest and, unfortunately, stays at Craggy Island's parochial house for his holidays much to the chagrin of Ted, Dougal, Jack and Mrs Doyle; although it's Ted's fault as he invited him to stay after feeling sorry for him!  Late one night a distraught and tearful Father Ted prays for relief from Father Stone's enthralling company.  The very next day, during a thunderstorm, Ted and Dougal are playing a round at Craggy Island's crazy golf course when they are joined by Father Stone.  After encouraging Father Stone to have a go, his golf club is struck by a bolt of lightning resulting in him being taken off to hospital.  \r\"Father Stone's been in there a long time hasn't he; do you think he's dead?\" Dougal asks Ted.\r\"They're probably doing tests\" replies a concerned Ted.\r\"What sort of tests?\" asks Dougal; \"General Knowledge?\"\r\"No...

It was rumoured that Bishop Brennan had engaged in an illicit affair with a woman and had fathered a son; mother and son were also believed to be living in the United States but this had not been confirmed...at least not until Father Jack discovered the video and watched it in the company of Fathers Ted and Dougal!  Bishop Brennan's threats to send Ted to an island off of the coast of Suriname and Dougal to the Philippines would not come to pass! \n"}, {"text": "Television celebrity Henry Sellars travels to Craggy Island to compere and judge in the annual All-Priests Look-a-Like competition in the episode, 'Competition Time'.

When we were in Rome!\" says Ted.\r\"That little fella in the art gallery?\" asks Dougal.\r\"That was the Vatican!\"\rNot many celebrities visit Craggy Island and Father Dougal is excited at the prospect of meeting Henry Sellars, even if he is something of a has-been.  Unbeknown to Father Ted and Father Dougal and, more importantly, Mrs Doyle, Henry Sellars' career is on a downward spiral after he had been sacked from the BBC for being an alcoholic.  Just after his arrival on Craggy Island, Mrs Doyle encourages Henry to have a small glass of sherry which he initially declines but accepts after coming under some pressure.  Needless to say, Henry immediately falls off the wagon and wrecks the living room before leaping through the window and escaping into the wilds of Craggy Island where, the following day, he is hunted down and tranquilized by the local police sergeant. \n"}, {"text": "At the All-Priests Look-a-Like competition, arch rivals from Rugged Island enter the contest with an impression of which all-girl Motown singing group?", "correct": "Diana Ross and The Supremes", "options": ["All Saints", "The Spice Girls", "The Runaways"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDiana Ross and The Supremes.\n\n\tFather Dick Byrne, the priest from Rugged Island, and his colleagues enter the All-Priests Look-a-Like Competition as Diana Ross and two of The Supremes.

On the plus side, at least Father Ted wins his bet with Father Dick Byrne, walking away from the competition with the amazing sum of five pounds! \n"}, {"text": "In the episode, 'And God Created Woman', the character played by actress Gemma Craven, Miss Polly Clark, works at which artistic occupation?", "correct": "Novelist", "options": ["Weaver", "Painter", "Photographer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNovelist.\n\n\t\"Good luck with the book\", said Father Ted; at the book-signing, in the lift, inside the car park and whilst waiting at some traffic lights.  Ted Crilly, as usual, grasps the wrong end of the stick in his dealings with the lovely novelist Polly Clark, assuming that she wants the same from their relationship as he does.  Unfortunately for Ted, she is looking for a retreat on Craggy Island where she can find some peace and maybe pursue her ambition of becoming a nun.  Trying to impress Polly, Father Ted leaves a selection of classic literature on the dining table in the living room.\r\"Do you like Dostoyevsky\" asks Polly.\r\"Oh yes, he's one of my favourites; I must've read that book ['Crime and Punishment'] about ten times!\" replies Ted.\r\"Ha, I see you're reading it again; there's a bookmark here on page seven\"\rAfter a brief discussion of the work, the conversation returns again to the subject of Polly's husband;\r\"Oh, you know it's great to talk to someone about these things.

That's heavy\" exclaims Ted passing Tom a shotgun shaped parcel as the van screeches to a halt outside the post office.  Tom races into the building and a moment later two shots ring out just before Tom flees the building and jumps back into his van.\r\"You haven't been up to your old tricks again, have you Tom?\" asks Father Ted.\r\"No Father, it's my money, I just didn't want to fill out the forms!\" replies Tom as he slams the van door and screeches away. \n"}, {"text": "During a visit by a very attractive young female solicitor, the two priests disbelieve that she could be a solicitor.  \"If you're a solicitor, I'm ____!\"  Who does Father Dougal say that he is?", "correct": "Boy George", "options": ["George Washington", "George Best", "George Michael"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBoy George.\n\n\tLaura Sweeney from Corless, Corless and Sweeney, the firm of solicitors representing Father Jack, arrives at Craggy Island's parochial house to inform Ted and Dougal that they have been left the sum of half a million pounds, to be shared between them, in his will.  It is in this episode, as mentioned earlier, that Ted believes that this visitor has bad news for him relating to his embezzlement of funds, explaining that it was \"just a routine relocation of funds\".  Miss Sweeney also explains that Father Jack has a terror of being buried alive and it is a condition of them both receiving his estate that they stand a vigil with his remains overnight before his funeral.  At this point neither Ted, Dougal or Mrs Doyle believe that such an attractive young lady could possibly be a senior partner in a solicitor's and insist that they will discuss Father Jack's business when they eventually speak to his legal advisor; with this the young solicitor begins to lose her temper with them both.  Cut to a scene in a dark and austere chapel where Father Jack's body is laid and we see Father Dougal gently rocking back and forth quietly singing 'Karma Chameleon' and Ted nursing a head wound!\r\"Oh, how's your head Ted?\" asks Dougal.\r\"Not too bad, it's true what they say about these career women, they're very aggressive\" replies Ted.\r\"Oh, and that language out of her; you wouldn't hear it from a docker!\" added Ted.\r\"Aye you would\" replies Dougal, \"They use very bad language!\" \n"}]}
