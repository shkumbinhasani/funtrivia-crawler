{"id": "354828", "name": "\"Kingdom Hearts\" - Spell It Out Trivia Game  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "  Video Games G-K", "Kingdom Hearts Games"], "questions": [{"text": "Haley Joel Osment voices the main character of the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series (US version). What is the name of this character?", "correct": "Sora", "options": ["Riku", "Roxas", "Cloud"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSora.\n\n\tSora is the main character throughout the main series (though there are some spinoff games where he does not appear). In the first game of the series, he is separated from his friends, Kairi and Riku, and goes on an adventure to find them. Of course, he also journeys to seal keyholes and find King Mickey, but his friends are usually first on his mind. \n"}, {"text": "While in the Hundred Acre Wood, one character needs help finding his tail. Which one?", "correct": "Eeyore", "options": ["Piglet", "Pooh", "Owl"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEeyore.\n\n\tEeyore is a gray-blue, and blue (as in sad), donkey originally created by A. A. Milne. In one mission in the Hundred Acre Wood level, Sora helps Pooh and his friends locate Eeyore's beloved appendage. \n"}, {"text": "One character in the series does not deem you worthy of \"hero\" status, but trains you for the games anyway. Who considers you a \"junior hero\"?", "correct": "Phil", "options": ["Hydra", "Meg", "Hercules"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPhil.\n\n\tPhil, which is short for Philoctetes, is the little fawn that trained Hercules to become a hero, and is now training Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Though he doesn't find the trio worthy, he allows them to receive passes to play the games at the Coliseum anyway.\r Interesting fact: in original Greek mythology, Philoctetes was a centaur, not a fawn. In the Disney film \"Hercules\", as well as in \"Kingdom Hearts\", he was apparently deemed better as a two-legged creature instead of the centaur he was in original myth. \n"}, {"text": "Though Donald the Duck's three nephews often change their outfit colors, in \"Kingdom Hearts\" it remains consistent. Who wears red?", "correct": "Huey", "options": ["Louie", "Dewey", "Donald"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHuey.\n\n\tThe colors of the three changed frequently until the 1980s, when the colors were finally decided matter-of-factly. The colors do still change from time to time, and is excused by saying they borrow each others clothes. However, the colors for Huey, Dewey, and Louie are red, blue, and green, respectively.\r To quote Dave Smith, from \"Disney A-Z\": \"Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.\" That should help if, like me, you ever forget which is which! \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is a bird you fought in Agrabah, but later befriended?", "correct": "Iago", "options": ["Mushu", "Zazu", "Kerchak"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIago.\n\n\tIago is a bird from the \"Aladdin\" series of Disney films. He is the parrot minion of Jafar. Though evil in the first game, he turns over a new feather in \"Kingdom Hearts II\"; or does he? \n"}, {"text": "Which of these is Sora's Nobody, also the main character of \"358/2 Days\"?", "correct": "Roxas", "options": ["Vexen", "Xemnas", "Axel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRoxas.\n\n\tRoxas is Sora's Nobody (a Nobody is created when a strong-hearted person becomes a Heartless). Roxas was part of Organization XIII, whose members are all special Nobodies. Interestingly, these Nobodies' names are the original person's name scrambled and with an X added.\r Roxas - Sora + X\rXemnas - Ansem + X\rAxel - Lea + X\rVexen - Even + X \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters, one of Maleficent's henchmen, was fought in Halloween Town?", "correct": "Oogie Boogie", "options": ["Hades", "Jafar", "Captain Hook"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOogie Boogie.\n\n\tOogie Boogie was fought inside his manor in Halloweentown, and then again when he somehow became the manor itself.

Which of them fights with a wooden stick?", "correct": "Tidus", "options": ["Selphie", "Wakka", "Riku"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTidus.\n\n\tTidus, originally from the \"Final Fantasy\" series, is seen as a younger version in \"Kingdom Hearts\". He uses a stick to attack. Selphie uses her jump rope as a weapon (which, in my opinion, is the toughest to fight), and Wakka uses a beach ball. Riku is a bit tougher than these three, and attacks very similarly to Sora. \n"}, {"text": "Many enemies are so large that only their head can be fought, and while in flight (or water). Which of these is fought on the ground?", "correct": "Hades", "options": ["Ansem", "Ursula", "Chernabog"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHades.\n\n\tHades is fought in a few places throughout the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, including the Underworld and Coliseum. He is from the Disney film \"Hercules\". Ursula was fought in Atlantica several times, a few times as a giant head (though one \"fight\" was through song), Chernabog was fought on Bald Mountain just before the End of the World level, and Ansem was fought several times in the End of the World in many different forms, some being as a large head. \n"}, {"text": "If you have correctly identified the first nine characters, this should be easy. Using the first letters of each answer, you can spell out the name of an optional boss of \"Kingdom Hearts\". Who is it?", "correct": "Sephiroth", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSephiroth.\n\n\tIn the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, many optional bosses are hidden throughout. One such boss is Sephiroth, who you can fight many times. In the first game, for instance, he can be fought in the Coliseum as the Platinum Match. He was originally the main enemy from \"Final Fantasy VII\", and was deemed one of the toughest bosses of video games.He lived up to this in \"Kingdom Hearts\", where even a fully leveled and equipped player can struggle to defeat him. He was also deemed one of the toughest in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", where you can fight him just before the Great Maw (after visiting the maw at least once). \n"}]}
