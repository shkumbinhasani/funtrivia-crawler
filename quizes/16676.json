{"id": "16676", "name": "Love Story Quiz | Love Story | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "  Movies L-P", "Love Story"], "questions": [{"text": "'Love Story' tracks Jenny's relationship with a fellow she calls Barrett. What's his full name?", "correct": "Oliver Barrett IV", "options": ["Barrett Philipson Emers", "Christopher Everett Barrett III", "Barrett Brookings Jr."], "explanation": "\n\n\nOliver Barrett IV.\n\n\tAccording to the movie, Barrett's great-grandfather donated Barrett Hall to Harvard. \n"}, {"text": "What does Jenny's father do for a living?", "correct": "He bakes pastries", "options": ["He lays bricks", "He sits around and looks important", "He stars in cheesy films"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe bakes pastries.\n\n\tPastries! NOT cookies! Or so Jenny insists. \n"}, {"text": "How do Jenny and Barrett feel about the 'church bit' (and the 'God bit')?", "correct": "negative", "options": ["positive", "comfortable", "uncomfortable"], "explanation": "\n\n\nnegative.\n\n\tThis causes Jenny's Catholic father some concern. \n"}, {"text": "Barrett's falling-out with his father causes some difficulty when it comes time for Barrett to pay for what?", "correct": "law school", "options": ["student loans", "a car", "a house"], "explanation": "\n\n\nlaw school.\n\n\tHe doesn't receive financial aid because he's a Barrett, and Barretts don't NEED financial aid. \n"}, {"text": "What is Jenny's great unsatisfied interest?", "correct": "music", "options": ["Frisbee", "painting", "economics"], "explanation": "\n\n\nmusic.\n\n\tShe gave up a scholarship to study music in Paris so that she could marry Barrett. (Aw! Ain't that SWEET?) \n"}, {"text": "What does the doctor tell Barrett Jenny is dying of?", "correct": "He doesn't specify", "options": ["A broken heart", "Cancer", "Bubonic plague"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHe doesn't specify.\n\n\tSeemed odd that Barrett never questioned that rather sketchy diagnosis ... \n"}, {"text": "What sport did Barrett play at Harvard?", "correct": "ice hockey", "options": ["football", "Frisbee!!", "baseball"], "explanation": "\n\n\nice hockey.\n\n\tBarrett was singlehandedly responsible for losing the title to Cornell (so sad!) And yes, ballroom dancing is a sport. The Australian movie 'Strictly Ballroom' is hilarious, by the way. It's a much, much better movie than 'Love Story.' \n"}, {"text": "When Barrett gives Jenny his father's phone number and she dials, many audience members become amused. Why?", "correct": "She isn't dialing the number he gave her! She's dialing 555-5555!", "options": ["It's all about the look on Barrett's face.", "It's a Pacific Bell phone in Washington, DC!

She's dialing 555-5555!.\n\n\tThe Pacific Bell payphone in Washington DC was actually a gaffe from the film 'Die Hard 2'. \n"}, {"text": "Jenny and Barrett move to what city in order to pursue Barrett's career?", "correct": "New York City", "options": ["Boston", "Los Angeles", "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNew York City.\n\n\tJenny dies in New York. \n"}, {"text": "Early in the movie, Barrett asks Jenny, 'Who's Phil?' after she ends a phone call. So, for $64,000, who IS Phil?", "correct": "Jenny's father", "options": ["Jenny's lover", "Jenny's best friend", "Jenny's pet gerbil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJenny's father.\n\n\tPhil doesn't believe in titles like 'Dad' or 'Mister.' He's enlightened, and everything. I think he's supposed to be the comic relief, but I'm not sure, because he wasn't comic. He was, however, just about the sole likeable person in the entire movie. (IMHO) \n"}]}
