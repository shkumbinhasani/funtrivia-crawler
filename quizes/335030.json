Dick's short story \"The Minority Report\", this movie starred Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell.  In the movie, Cruise starred as a PreCrime agent in the year 2054.

At midnight, the population of the entire city, plunged into eternal night, would fall asleep and be manipulated by the powers-that-be.  Soon, however, John discovered that his own powers rivaled those of The Strangers, and with the help of a scientist (played by Kiefer Sutherland) they could finally see the sun.\rAlex Proyas also directed \"The Crow\" and \"I, Robot\".  \"Dark City\" was his third feature film and it received relatively good reviews from critics while earning about $27,000,000 in the box office. \n"}, {"text": "Fifteen minutes in the future is all you may wish to spend in this 2007 film set aboard a spaceship and heading to the sun.

As they neared the sun, they faced off against their own minds and the horrors that lay waiting in space.\rAlthough director Danny Boyle had directed \"Trainspotting\" and \"28 Days Later\" prior to \"Sunshine\", his popularity had failed to allow the movie to recover its costs- it only took in $32,000,000 in the box office.

Theo raced across the UK and into the refugee zones to reach a possible safe haven, a research ship known only as Tomorrow, facing off against the military, terrorists, and others along the way.  The movie also starred Julianne Moore and Michael Caine.\rDirector Alfonso Cuaron had previously directed \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" and the third \"Harry Potter\" film.  \"Children of Men\" topped a number of critics' lists of top films in 2006 and was nominated for three Oscars.

What movie was this?", "correct": "Planet of the Apes", "options": ["Alien", "2001: A Space Odyessy", "Gorillas in the Mist"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPlanet of the Apes.\n\n\tAlthough most of this movie seemed like it would lead up to the humans from the future landing on a distant planet where humans were captured and apes ruled the land, it was not to be.  Instead, Charlton Heston discovered that they had inadvertently landed back on Earth in the future in a time when apes had taken over and destroyed human civilization.  It took another four movies to discover the roundabout story as to how this all came to happen.  This movie was later remade in 2001 by Tim Burton.

Dick's \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\".\rThis one earned over $250,000,000, hit number one in the box office, and became a relatively well-received film (as per critics).

This included four stones and their protector, Leeloo, played by Milla Jovovich.  The movie also starred Gary Oldman, Chris Tucker (as the obnoxious, eccentric Ruby Rhod), and Ian Holm.
