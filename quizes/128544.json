{"id": "128544", "name": "\"Swallows and Amazons\" Part 2 Quiz | Kid Lit Authors L - Z | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Kid Lit Authors L - Z", " Arthur Ransome"], "questions": [{"text": "Which is the first book in the series of twelve?", "correct": "Swallows and Amazons", "options": ["Swallowdale", "Great Northern", "Peter Duck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwallows and Amazons.\n\n\tRoger is the first ever character mentioned by Arthur Ransome. He is pretending to be a sailing ship as he carries his father's telegram from his mother back to the others.In two books neither the Swallows nor the Amazons appear. These are \"Coot Club\" and \"The Big Six\" where Dick and Dorothea are the main characters. \n"}, {"text": "Which is the last book in the series of twelve?", "correct": "Great Northern?", "options": ["The Picts and the Martyrs", "The Big Six", "Missee Lee"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGreat Northern?.\n\n\tAn unfinished book which Hugh Brogan entitled \"Coots in the North\" suggests that Ransome wanted to write another book in which the Amazons met the Death and Glories. Notice the question mark on the end of the title \"Great Northern?\" That's because the children weren't really sure what sort of bird Dick had spotted. \n"}, {"text": "Which characters make their first appearance in \"Winter Holiday\"?", "correct": "Dick and Dorothea", "options": ["Nancy and Peggy", "Tom Dudgeon and Mrs. Barrable", "Port and Starboard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDick and Dorothea.\n\n\tWe meet Dick and Dorothea at the beginning of \"Winter Holiday\" and see the ways in which they gradually make friends with John, Susan, Titty, Roger, Nancy and Peggy. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the girls is the one who finds water by dowsing or water divining with a hazel twig in \"Pigeon Post\"?", "correct": "Titty", "options": ["Peggy", "Susan", "Dorothea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTitty.\n\n\tIt has to be Titty. She is the character that has the most imagination and the most sensitive nature. That is why the experience proves to be so frightening for her. It all seems worthwhile when she sees the little hedgehog drinking from the small well that they make. \n"}, {"text": "To which country do John, Susan, Titty and Roger sail in \"We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea\"?", "correct": "Holland or the Netherlands", "options": ["France", "Belgium", "Denmark"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHolland or the Netherlands.\n\n\tThey end up in the port of Flushing in Holland.

In the end the Margoletta has to be rescued by the crew of the Death and Glory. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Missee Lee\" who or what is the main cause of the sinking of the Wild Cat?", "correct": "Gibber the monkey", "options": ["A pirate attack", "A sudden typhoon", "A collision with an underwater reef."], "explanation": "\n\n\nGibber the monkey.\n\n\tIt is all caused by Gibber the monkey getting hold of Captain Flint's cigar - another good example of the dangers of smoking! \n"}, {"text": "What is the main crime that has to be investigated by the big six detectives in \"The Big Six\"?", "correct": "The problem of who is setting boats adrift on the Norfolk Broads.", "options": ["The problem of who is attacking the local birds.", "The problem of who is stealing food from the inn.", "The problem of who is stealing cars from local residents."], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe problem of who is setting boats adrift on the Norfolk Broads.\n\n\tIt is the Death and Glories (Joe, Bill and Pete) who come under suspicion.
