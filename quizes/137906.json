{"id": "137906", "name": "M*A*S*H - 'Officer of the Day' Quiz | Television | 15 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "M*A*S*H", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "As we fade in to another episode of 'M*A*S*H' we see the flags of South Korea, the United States and the U.N. being lowered.  Yes, Frank Burns is once again in charge while Henry is away, and naturally he has ordered an inspection.  Before the inspection, Ferret Face orders an ill-advised ceremonial salute that targets Radar's bugle.  Which character reluctantly fires the cannon salute? ", "correct": "Igor", "options": ["Klinger", "Goldman", "Zale"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIgor.\n\n\tFrank Burns doesn't need Murphy's Law to operate, he is an automatic walking disaster.  He orders Igor to fire a salute with Radar standing virtually in the way.  Fortunately, the only things that are damaged from the cannon fire are Radar's bugle (Burghoff is an awful bugle player anyway!) and his pride.  Radar's reaction to this assault is always worth a good laugh! \n"}, {"text": "After ordering arms, Frank Burns makes a little speech to the camp, announcing his authority to all those concerned.  He also introduces his 'fine adjutant', Margaret Houlihan.  Finish this Frank Burns quote: 'Talking to the Major (Houlihan) is like talking to me since we are ________ with each other at all times!' (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Intimate", "options": ["Privy", "Familiar", "Quartered"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIntimate.\n\n\tMargaret's sour expression after this comment is lovely to behold, as is Frank's realization of his grave error (as if anyone in the camp doesn't know about the relationship between the two!)  Radar saves the day by calling for the men to present arms for inspection. \n"}, {"text": "During the company inspection, Frank puts one of the men on report for which of the following 'infractions'?", "correct": "Heavy beard in combat zone", "options": ["Excessive nose hair for an enlisted man", "Yawning while wielding a firearm", "Shirt untucked too close to the front lines"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeavy beard in combat zone.\n\n\tThe nose hair joke was already seized upon by Harry Morgan, playing General Steele, in 'The General Flipped at Dawn'.  Frank tries to one-up the nutty general with the 'heavy beard' comment after noticing that one of the privates is not clean shaven.  This goes along with Frank's suggestion to Hawkeye (twice, in other episodes) to 'take one step closer to the razor.' \n"}, {"text": "Next up, Klinger.  Naturally, the disgruntled Toledoan doesn't disappoint, wearing an assortment of feminine accessories.  Which of these delightful adornments does Frank complain about first?", "correct": "Fingernail polish", "options": ["High heels", "Earrings", "Pearl ring"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFingernail polish.\n\n\tWe find out that Klinger wears 'Flame D'Amour' fingernail polish, and if that is not enough, earrings, a very large ring and white high heels.  This is enough to compel Frank to comment that Klinger is 'a disgrace to American man- and womanhood!' \n"}, {"text": "We discover at this point that Frank has selected Hawkeye to be officer of the day.  When Frank discovers that neither Trapper nor Hawkeye made it to inspection (naturally) he immediately heads toward the Swamp where Hawkeye is still sleeping.  Frank is known for making oddball replies to innocuous greetings by Trapper.  How does Frank respond to Trapper's 'Hi, Frank' in this episode?", "correct": "That doesn't scare me one bit!", "options": ["What's that supposed to mean?", "Well, same to you pal!", "Wouldn't you like to know?"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThat doesn't scare me one bit!.\n\n\tAnyone who watches the first several seasons of 'M*A*S*H' must be familar with Frank's strange little responses to Trapper.  It's as if he is automatically programmed to be insulted, and hence fires off these defensive little comments reflexively.  His response to Trapper's 'Bye, Frank'?  'That was totally uncalled for!'  As for Hawkeye, Frank rudely interrupts his sleep, insisting that the poor chap serve as officer-of-the-day.  Let the fun begin! \n"}, {"text": "After being rudely hoisted from his cot by Frank Burns, Hawkeye describes his dream, which includes himself and his mother walking along the beach.  He claims to see a 'giant, bleached out _______ lying on the sand.'  (Fill in the blank)", "correct": "Frank Burns", "options": ["Octopus", "Shark", "Jellyfish"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFrank Burns.\n\n\tHe continues, 'It's white belly shining in the sun.  Mommy, can I touch it?  She said, 'Be careful son, the dullness rubs off.'  I'm not sure what this story means, other than that it relates how dull Frank Burns is.  For some reason, this 'M*A*S*H' moment has been burned into my memory! \n"}, {"text": "When Frank hands Hawkeye a gun in holster as part of his O.D. uniform, Hawkeye is prompted to make his now-famous speech about not wearing a sidearm.  Which of these does he not include in his legendary 'carry' speech?", "correct": "Harry Carey", "options": ["Cary Grant", "Carry me back to old Virginia", "Hara-kiri"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHarry Carey.\n\n\tHere's the transcript:\r 'I will not carry a gun, Frank.  When I got into this war I had a very clear understanding with the Pentagon, no guns!  I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash and carry, carry me back to old Virginia, I'll even hara-kiri if you show me how, but I will not carry a gun!'\r Classic... \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye reluctantly accepts his new position as O.D. and is immediately set upon by the rapacious Radar, who insists on collecting Hawkeye's signature on the daily camp forms.  Hawkeye is also requested to change the guard, and the daily password.  Which daily password is decided on for the guards?", "correct": "Betty Boop", "options": ["Mickey Mouse", "Betty Grable", "Harry Truman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBetty Boop.\n\n\tBetty Boop was the password the day before, and will remain so because Hawkeye is of the opinion that it is 'an unpretentious little password, but it's got sex!'  Hawkeye orders the guards to 'be brave, be loyal and be true...but keep your white flags ready just in case.' \n"}, {"text": "Hawkeye immediately proceeds to Henry's office where he begins 'inspecting the inside of his eyelids'.  Radar rudely awakens Hawkeye because an LIP (Local Indigenous Personnel) needs medical attention.  This fellow is the first of several folks with the identical name.  What is this repeating name of the day?", "correct": "Kim Luck", "options": ["Chung Lee", "Park Chee", "Sang Min"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKim Luck.\n\n\tIn all, Hawkeye sees five Kim Lucks during his day as O.D., a new record for the 4077th.  As Hawkeye puts it, 'this must be our Kim Luck-y day.' \n"}, {"text": "As if having filling out forms, seeing to LIPs and generally missing out on sleep is not enough, Hawkeye must next confront that madcap 'intelligence' man Colonel Flagg.  Approaching Flagg, Hawkeye introduces himself by his O.D. arm band, announcing himself as which famous actress?", "correct": "Olivia de Havilland & Olivia deHavilland & de Havilland & deHavilland & Havilland", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nOlivia de Havilland & Olivia deHavilland & de Havilland & deHavilland & Havilland.\n\n\tFlagg of course sees right through this ruse, recognizing Hawkeye as 'Perkins.  Captain Perkins!'  When Hawkeye corrects Flagg by saying, 'Pierce', Flagg replies, 'That's what I said, Captain Pierce', to which Hawkeye responds, 'Right, Perkins.' \n"}, {"text": "Flagg has arrived at camp with a wounded North Korean soldier that he wants patched up quickly so that the Colonel can execute him over the weekend.", "correct": "True", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrue.\n\n\tFlagg's crazy plan does not go over well with Hawkeye, or Trapper, who is assigned to operate on the wounded soldier.  Naturally, the two doctors conspire to foil Flagg's plan! \n"}, {"text": "One of the sub-plots of this episode involves a tailor, Mr. Yu, who is creating a new suit for Trapper.  Not only is Mr. Yu a rotten tailor, his two sons, Marshall and Elroy, cause big problems with their kleptomania.  Among the items they steal from the camp is which of these vital objects?", "correct": "Radar's teddy bear", "options": ["Trapper's watch", "Hawkeye's swizzle stick", "Frank's mother's picture"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRadar's teddy bear.\n\n\tIf you'll recall, the other three items mentioned were stolen in the year one episode called 'I Hate a Mystery'.  In this episode, as Hawkeye puts it, 'one of our teddy bears has gone missing.' \n"}, {"text": "Trapper and Hawkeye, performing in their typical subversive manner, refuse to cooperate with Colonel Flagg's plans, prompting the latter to call the two doctors a couple of...?", "correct": "Cutie pies", "options": ["Sweethearts", "Fruit cakes", "Pastry puffs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCutie pies.\n\n\tHe also says, 'You clowns are pushing me around pretty good, cooperation-wise.' to which Hawkeye retorts, 'Not to mention wise-guy-wise.'  It's pretty clear that the writers of this television show do not hold 'military intelligence' in high regard, based on the Flagg character.  In fact, Trapper calls 'military intelligence' a 'contradiction in terms' during the episode. \n"}, {"text": "Another sub-plot in this episode revolves around Corporal Klinger, who is desperate for a three-day pass to Seoul.  He attempts to escape several times during the episode.  Does he finally get his wish?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAfter dressing as a nun and a 'business girl', Klinger finally makes it out of camp via the ambulance.  Trapper and Hawkeye place him on the gurney to substitute for the wounded North Korean soldier, thus killing two birds with one stone!  Won't Flagg be surprised when he sees how large the young soldier's nose is? \n"}, {"text": "At the end of the episode, we see the result of Mr. Yu's tailoring, but there is something wrong with the suit he has made for Trapper.  What, exactly, is the problem?", "correct": "The pinstripes are horizontal", "options": ["The pants have three legs", "There are no pockets", "It's a one piece suit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe pinstripes are horizontal.\n\n\tIt's actually not a bad looking suit, and a unique style too!  The good-natured Trapper sure doesn't seem to mind...\r Thank you for trying this quiz, I hope you have enjoyed it...and if so, please have a look at my other 'M*A*S*H' episode quizzes. \n"}]}
