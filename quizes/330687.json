{"id": "330687", "name": "Oh No!  A Cliche Horror Film! Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Horror Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "Jack and Sally aren't even in this part of the movie; instead, their friend sets the tone of the film by (ironically) watching a cliche horror movie in her house before she's attacked by an unknown assailant.\n\nThe opening sequence of a film is often the best chance to exhibit a gratuitous kill to set the mood.  Which of these films did not include a death before its title card appeared onscreen?", "correct": "The Blair Witch Project", "options": ["Scream", "Saw 2", "Hatchet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Blair Witch Project.\n\n\tCertainly the killer opening, Jack and Sally don't find out about their victim friend until the next day at school when the news of his or her death sends a shockwave of gossip through their classmates.  Who could this murderer be?  Will he strike again?  Unrest is afoot.\r \"Scream\", Wes Craven's 1996 satirical horror flick, was clever in this approach.  Starting off the film by killing off already-popular Drew Barrymore, the writer/director subverted film-goers' expectations while providing a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the way horror movies were generally constructed.  Later parody films like \"Scary Movie\" and \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th\" would do the same thing (with less tact) in later years.  Proceeding titles in the \"Scream\" series continued to kill off major cast members before the film title appeared on screen.  \"Hatchet\", Adam Green's 2006 romp into 'old-school American' horror (yes, another tongue-in-cheek homage) did the same thing killing of Robert Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame) in the first few minutes.  \"Saw II\" was the first in the extensive franchise (released in 2005 and directed by Darren Lynn Bousman) to feature a deadly trap before the opening.\r \"The Blair Witch Project\" is the odd one out.  Because this semi-realistic mockumentary was filmed by its actors over the course of eight days, no one died until much later in the film to encourage realism.  The movie was a forerunner in the 'shaky-cam' style of horror filmmaking years before the likes of \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Cloverfield\", and it became the most profitable film until the former was released in 2009. \n"}, {"text": "Considering the recent murders, Jack and Sally stay at home and lock the doors and windows.  Some of their other, more skeptical, friends decide not to take precautions and one of Jack's peers is gruesomely dispatched while out on an unnecessary stroll.\n\nThe great outdoors can be a stark setting for the perfect murder.  In which movie was at least one of the victims killed outdoors?", "correct": "Funny Games", "options": ["The Strangers", "Quarantine", "Resident Evil"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFunny Games.\n\n\tSome people just laugh at death; some people go against every obvious smart idea.  Jack and Sally are now one friend down as per this idiotic move from one of their friends.  And so the body count rises.\r \"Funny Games\", an Austrian film released in 1997 (and re-released as a shot-for-shot remake in 2008 by the same director), was created by Michael Haneke.  Certainly a weird entry into the thriller/horror genre, the movie constantly breaks the fourth wall and subverts its own realities to mess with its helpless victims and its audience.  In the remake, starring Tim Roth and Naomi Watts, Watts' character is tied up and simply pushed into a lake.\r \"The Strangers\", released in 2008 as well, saw its deaths in a single house.  The same goes for the 2008 handi-cam film \"Quarantine\" while \"Resident Evil\", based on the video game series of the same name, took place in the underground facility known as The Hive.  It was released in 2002. \n"}, {"text": "Okay - now people realize it's all a serious issue.  A killer is on the loose.  Everyone in town decides to head home before an instated curfew.  One of Sally's girlfriends, Barbara, closes down the diner she works at just before the clock strikes the hour.  Her remains are found in a dumpster behind the restaurant.\n\nWhich of these famous films explicitly featured a character named Barbara?", "correct": "Night of the Living Dead", "options": ["The Uninvited", "28 Days Later", "I Know What You Did Last Summer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNight of the Living Dead.\n\n\t\"They're coming to get you, Barbara!\"  Alas, this victim should've seen her own fate coming.  When Sally and Jack realize the severity of their situation, they realize that everyone is in grave danger.  Soon, a pattern develops, and they head out to warn the rest of their friends.\r A true horror forefather, \"Night of the Living Dead\" was released as a black and white film by famous horror director George A. Romero (who would go on to make tons of zombie films in later years).  Released in 1968, the film was a benchmark for the genre.  Not only was the film regarded by critics and viewers as a true game-changer, but they thought it was actually scary!  Zombie films, in later decades, became a subgenre in itself with books, video games, and franchises devoted to the shambling undead.  Barbara was one of the characters seen in the very beginning of the film; she and her brother were heading to the cemetery to visit their father.  She came face to face with one of the early zombies.  Her brother's line, \"They're coming to get you, Barbara\", is iconic. \n"}, {"text": "When Sally goes to warn another of her friends that she may be next, the two of them are ambushed by the killer!  Sally gets away, but her friend isn't so lucky; she's thrown from the balcony of a sorority house.  She runs back to Jack's consoling embrace and back into their house.\n\nA gratuitous setting with obvious intents in a cliche horror film, which of these movies did not involve deaths at a sorority house?", "correct": "Valentine", "options": ["Black Christmas", "Decoys", "Sorority Row"], "explanation": "\n\n\nValentine.\n\n\tUh oh!  It's too late as once more, the killer strikes again.  Maybe everyone should just stick together, not investigate the sounds in the basement, or make sure that they get reception on their cell phones.  Then again... this is a cliche horror film...\r Sally's sorority friend was dispatched in a scene similar to one in \"Scream 2\" in which Sarah Michelle Gellar's 'disposable' character was tossed off the front balcony of her sorority house while a party was held across campus.  \"Valentine\", created by \"Urban Legend\" director Jamie Blanks, featured several female casualties at the hand of a disgruntled face from their past, but this 2001 film did not include this cliche setting seen in the other movies.\r \"Black Christmas\", regarded by fans as one of the first slasher films, was directed by Bob Clark and released in 1974.  It featured sorority girls stalked by a murderer hiding in their attic.  \"Sorority Row\" was a 2009 remake of \"The House on Sorority Row\" (originally released as a slasher film in 1983).  Both, clearly, contain sorority houses.  \"Decoys\" was an alien flick released in 2004 and set on a college campus (including the sorority house). \n"}, {"text": "Jack and Sally call the police looking for help.  Informing them that many of their friends have been murdered, Jack and Sally wait for a squad car to pull up and take them to safety.  The squad car never arrives.\n\nSometimes the scariest fear comes from the supposedly secure becoming the unsafe.  In which horror movie were the police actually the enemies?", "correct": "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)", "options": ["Slither", "Splinter", "Halloween (2007)"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003).\n\n\tJack and Sally have no choice but to wonder, could the police be behind it all?  Who can they trust?  No - the police aren't behind it.  The cops called to protect them were attacked by the killer first.  No one's coming to help them, and no one knows they're unsafe.\r While the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", directed in 1974 by Tobe Hooper, did not feature an evil sheriff, the remake, released in 2003 under the Platinum Dunes name, did contain one.  Also starring Jessica Biel, the remake of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" made over $100,000,000 in the box office and was the first to be created under Michael Bay's production company.  A sequel (subtitled \"The Beginning\") was released three years later.\rIn the three other choices, \"Slither\", \"Splinter', and Rob Zombie's 2007 \"Halloween\" remake, the police tried to help, often failing to do so.  After all, if you could simply ask the police to solve things, it wouldn't be as horrific, would it? \n"}, {"text": "Before any safety can come to Jack and Sally, a momentary talk between the two of them is interrupted by a pickax thrown directly between them (though it misses and strikes a nearby wall).  The two of them are forced to flee into a dark, reputedly haunted forest.\n\nAh!  3D gimmicks - can't have enough of those in our cliche horror film.  In which of these 3D movies are you likely to see a 3D pickax thrown towards the camera?", "correct": "My Bloody Valentine 3D", "options": ["The Final Destination", "Resident Evil: Afterlife", "Saw 3D"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMy Bloody Valentine 3D.\n\n\tYes, this being a blockbuster horror film and all, 3D technology needs to make its way in there somehow.  Unfortunately, our cliche horror film was conceived before 3D made its reemergence in cinema and all of the enhancement work was done in post-production.  Since our movie languished on the shelves an extra year (darn distributors... claiming that they can't find a release date) it never got around to all the early hype.  It looks perfectly fine though... right?  Right?\r \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\", released early in 2009, was one of the first films in the horror genre to bring back the 3D technology which, in many cases, can be described as hideously unnecessary.  Remaking a notoriously graphic Canadian horror film of the same name (sans the 3D) released in 1981, Jensen Ackles starred and the movie took in over $100,000,000.  Not only was it in 3D... it was a remake too.  How cliche.\r \"The Final Destination\" (2009), \"Resident Evil: Afterlife\" (2010), and \"Saw 3D\" (2010) all utilized 3D technology as well, and all of them made oodles of money. \n"}, {"text": "After several near-misses at the hands of the killer, Jack and Sally both decide to set a trap to catch their killer once and for all.  With Macgyver-like cleverness, the two create a semi-elaborate snare and successfully trap their masked murderer.\n\nUsually, horror villains don't fall for this type of ruse, but in our film, it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.  In which of these films were the victims able to turn the tables on their killers with a trap?", "correct": "P2", "options": ["28 Weeks Later", "Devil", "The Crazies"], "explanation": "\n\n\nP2.\n\n\tWith only a small length of rope, a piece of twine pulled from the elastic of a pair of underwear, two large tree branches, a sharpened stick, Sally's hairpin, and perseverance, the two manage to construct a trap that catches their killer.  They embrace and decide to go for help... but not before discovering the truth.\r \"P2\", directed by Franck Khalfoun, showed up in theaters in 2007.  While not the most profitable film, this thriller was an unexpected gem from the mind of Alexandre Aja.  A woman headed home on Christmas and was the last to reach her car in her office's parking garage.  Little did she know, one of the security guards had plans for her.  In the final sequence of the film, the victim was able to trap her crazed predator using a pair of handcuffs and convincing acting. \n"}, {"text": "Jack and Sally unmask the killer to find that *GASP* it was Jack's half-brother all along.  They should've known - all the evidence pointed to him!  It all falls into place... little do they know, though, that their captive killer is already loosening himself from their trap.\n\nIn which of these horror films was the evil killer literally unmasked?", "correct": "Darkness Falls", "options": ["A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Paranormal Activity", "Pulse"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDarkness Falls.\n\n\tAlas!  The killer is someone expected to be quite close to our male protagonist.  Nonetheless, the duo is shocked to discover the truth.  Little do they know, their killer is already working to free himself from their clever trap.\r Although fairly supernatural, the creature seen in the 2003 film \"Darkness Falls\" wore a mask to cover her severely-burned face.  The Tooth Fairy, as she was known, had her mask removed in the final scenes of the movie (set in a lighthouse) and she exploded in a blast of light.  Although many famous horror icons (Jason, Michael Myers, Ghostface etc.) wore masks, many were much creepier without.  \"A Nightmare on Elm Street's\" Freddy Krueger, the unseen ghosts of \"Paranormal Activity\", and the technological ghosts of \"Pulse\" didn't need to wear masks - they were scary enough! \n"}, {"text": "Oh no!  The killer has broken free!  Jack and Sally run from their unmasked man but find themselves on the edge of a ravine.  In a heroic act, Jack sacrifices himself to tackle his half-brother over the cliffside!  Aieeee!\n\nIn which of these films was a female character the only survivor?", "correct": "Friday the 13th (1980)", "options": ["Predator", "Deep Blue Sea", "The Thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFriday the 13th (1980).\n\n\tThis horror genre trope is known as the 'final girl'.\r In Sean S. Cunningham's memorable horror film \"Friday the 13th\", only one girl, Alice, remained in the finale.  The same could be said for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in \"Halloween\", Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in \"Alien\", and Sidney (Neve Campbell) in the \"Scream\" films.  The other three films listed (\"Deep Blue Sea\", \"Predator\" and \"The Thing\") did not see any female characters as their sole survivors; \"The Thing\" actually contained no female characters whatsoever.\r As the two plunge over the edge of the cliff, Sally screams in fear.  Her boyfriend and his half-brother hurtle to the ground below; surely, both will never survive the fall.  This is the moment the police arrive... moments too late.  Sally is safe and the nightmare is over.  Or is it? \n"}, {"text": "It seems everything has returned to its stasis.  As the camera zooms into the killer's corpse at the bottom of the ravine, his hand clenches into a fist.  Is it truly the end?!\n\nIn which of these movies did the killer survive to wreak havoc in a sequel?", "correct": "Saw", "options": ["1408", "The Unborn", "Orphan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSaw.\n\n\tThe Jigsaw Killer (played by Tobin Bell) in several (hundred) \"Saw\" films debuted in the first movie of the series released in 2004.  The series, quite the popular franchise, grossed upwards of $750,000,000 over the course of six films.  Becoming, arguably, one of the most important series of films in the 2000s, the \"Saw\" films put the 'torture porn' subgenre out there every single year making Halloween \"Saw\" territory in theaters.  Tobin Bell's character was killed in the end of the third entry of the series... though he appeared in flashbacks in all of the rest of them.\r \"1408\" and \"The Unborn\" were both supernatural horror films and did not contain a flesh-and-blood killer.  \"Orphan\", on the other hand, saw its killer meet their fate in the end (and oh was it satisfying). \n"}]}
