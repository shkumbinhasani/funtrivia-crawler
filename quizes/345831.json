{"id": "345831", "name": "Born This Way Online Trivia | Beauty Accessories & Fashion | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "     Beauty Accessories & Fashion", "Fashion & Beauty Mixture"], "questions": [{"text": "You see, I was born with luxurious locks-- you know, ones that tumble from my head, blow in the wind, and catch the light just right.\n\nSome people have to dye their hair.  Some men opt to use a metallic pigmentation to cover greys.  What is this popular 'dye' option known as?", "correct": "Grecian formula", "options": ["Highlights", "Hydrogen peroxide", "Hair club"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrecian formula.\n\n\tAlthough there are many hair dyes out there on the market, many older men opt to purchase the Grecian Formula, a chemical containing metal shades that darken with each subsequent use or with more concentrated solutions.  Many Grecian Formula products say that they will regenerate hair to it's original colour, but really it just progresses closer and closer to blackness.  It is, in effect, just as much a dye as any other.\rLead acetate, one of the chemicals in this particular product, is also used in paints and varnishes.  As such, some countries pay close attention to the ingredients and ban those without safer replacements; it could cause lead poisoning.\r This is why it pays to be born with beautiful, never-damaged hair...like me. \n"}, {"text": "The hair I was born with is beautiful-- you don't even know!  Well, you would if you saw it.  I make sure to keep it unrestrained, free to the world.\n\nWhich of these objects would be fine to wear if I didn't want to cover my hair?", "correct": "Croc", "options": ["Trilby", "Fedora", "Bowler"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCroc.\n\n\tA Croc is a single shoe made of thick foam that molds to the size of the foot and as such it is not something one would place on their head.  Love them or hate them, Crocs found popularity as an everyday shoe with foot health benefits despite being named one of the worst inventions of the 2000s by \"Time\" magazine.\r The other choices are all hats.  A bowler (also known as a derby) is a round hat from the mid-19th century; the fedora and trilby are both longer hats, pinched in the crown.  All three are usually made of felt but can also be made of wool.\r Of course, none of these hats matter if you're like me and want to keep your hair free. \n"}, {"text": "I was born with the perfect lips.  Need I say more?  They just work well with my face; the ladies can't seem to get enough of them; they're ideal.\n\nWhich of these ingredients are you least likely to find in lipstick?", "correct": "Watermelon seeds", "options": ["Mica", "Fish scales", "Pig fat"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWatermelon seeds.\n\n\tLipstick is an odd mixture of ingredients.  Since there are so many styles of lipstick, lip chap, lip balm, lip gloss, and so on, there are different types of waxes used as a base, pigments used to create thousands upon thousands of shades and colours, and all sorts of wacky ingredients.  Specifically, fish scales and different minerals (eg. mica) are used to create shinier lipsticks.  Pig fat does the same thing with non-metallic colours.  That's not to say you can't find lipstick containing no animal by-products, or course.\r Hey-- if you're lucky, you won't need to worry about any of this.  Being born with lips like these is a blessing. \n"}, {"text": "Some would say that my fingernails are an affront to the Gods.  I was born with wonderful fingernails.  I would never want to colour them.\n\nIf they happened to be coloured, I'd use a nail polish remover to return them to normal.  What chemical are you likely to find in nail polish remover that allows colours to lift off?", "correct": "Acetone", "options": ["Acrylic", "Keratin", "Linoleic acid"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAcetone.\n\n\tAcetone is (CH3)2CO, also known as dimethyl formaldehyde., and you'll probably know it by its smell.  Acetone is what removes fingernail/toenail polish, but it's also an active ingredient in most commercial paint thinners.  In small doses, acetone isn't a big deal but in higher concentrations it's potentially harmful, particularly as an irritant.  Nail polishes can be found in many different colours; each is created by the addition of pigments to an acetate and other components.\r But you know what?  I don't touch the stuff.  I was born with perfect nails. \n"}, {"text": "I smell great.  In fact, I was born with a wonderful smell.  You wouldn't even think I sweat.\n\nThe body normally contains many types of smells, but halitosis can possibly be improved by which of these?", "correct": "Whitened teeth", "options": ["Foot powder", "Deodorant", "Laser skin treatment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWhitened teeth.\n\n\tWhile studies haven't proven that professionally-whitened teeth are able to cure halitosis, bad breath, this process is a fairly popular one for most dental visitors, usually for a cosmetic sake.  Whitening teeth can reduce decay and improve tooth enamel.  Halitosis wouldn't be improved by any of the other options; you wouldn't want to get rid of that smell with those items/treatments.  Deodorant is a spray or bar used to reduce the scent of perspiration, foot powder is used to relieve feet of different ailments, and laser skin treatment is used by some as a cosmetic process to eliminate surface scars or issues (eg. acne).  These don't even get into the smells of cologne and perfume!\r Not that I need any of these, of course.  If you remember, I was born virtually perfect.  No need for tooth bleach or artificial odours. \n"}, {"text": "You're right-- I do have perfect posture and an idyllic figure.  I was born with it, you see.\n\nTo alter their figures, many men and women of the past wore corsets designed to fit around which of these body parts?", "correct": "Torsos", "options": ["Legs", "Arms", "Heads"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTorsos.\n\n\tThe corset is a fashionable item made with thick material (eg. wood and bone in the past, plastic in the present) covered by fabric such as wool or cloth.  The corset was tied around the torso and pulled taught to constrict the body, creating a thinner, tighter body shape.  Many women of the Victorian period wore these to create hourglass figures; some men did the same to thin themselves.  Unfortunately, this led to a great deal of fainting.  Corsets reemerged with goth culture in the late twentieth century, but contemporary corsets were only meant to appear thinning and mimic the style without actually tightening.\r But me?  In one of those?  That would be insulting.  There's no reason to mess with what I was born with. \n"}, {"text": "Why would anyone cut into this body?  The last thing I need is augmentative surgery.  What do you think needs to be improved?  (I'd say nothing-- I was born an impeccable being.)\n\nA liposuction is a plastic surgery procedure which is also associated with what name?", "correct": "Tummy tuck", "options": ["Brow lift", "Breast enhancement", "Nose job"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTummy tuck.\n\n\tLiposuction involves the removal of fat from larger areas of the body.  While this procedure is usually cosmetic, it can also be done for medical reasons, especially on obese patients (for example, morbidly-obese patients with diabetes and other complications).  A tummy tuck is an informal term for a similar procedure known as abdominoplasty, which relates to the removal of fat and reshaping of the abdomen area; during this procedure, a liposuction is usually performed.\r Unsurprisingly, plastic surgery is all-the-rage.  I don't need it though.  I was born this way and I don't need to change. \n"}, {"text": "I may have been born a certain way, but underwear is a necessity.  There's no denying the importance of a fitting pair.\n\nWhich usually contains the most material?", "correct": "Men's boxers", "options": ["Men or women's thong", "Men's briefs", "Women's G-string"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMen's boxers.\n\n\tUnderwear is funny business, mostly because of the fierce preferences between different people and the uncanny desire of some to know what others are wearing (the immortal \"boxers or briefs?\").  Men's boxers contain the most material; they're loose, fitting, but longer than briefs which tend to be more form-fitting, shorter, and more elastic.  There is a hybrid-- the boxer-briefs, which are longer, but snugger.  Thongs contain less material.  They're thin all around.  The G-string contains even less.  Most women wear these to conceal pantylines.  Men seem to have no excuses.\r Despite the way I was born, it's no surprise that I wear underwear.  Sometimes it doesn't matter how perfect you are physically. \n"}, {"text": "I think I've mentioned my perfect skin before; I was born with amazing skin.  Some people aren't so lucky, however.\n\nEpilation refers to the removal of which of these bodily features, often for cosmetic reasons?", "correct": "Hair", "options": ["Birthmarks", "Warts", "Scars"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHair.\n\n\tEpilation is a technical term for hair removal.  This can apply to waxing, shaving, plucking, etc.  To improve body image, many men and women will wax their legs, chests, eyebrows, and other features; men often 'sculpt' themselves in a technique known as 'manscaping' (serious term) which involves precise shaving of chest and face to appear more attractive.  Some women opt for a more painful treatment, bikini waxing, to remove hair from less appropriate regions.  Hair removal can also be performed with lasers, but what can't be performed with lasers these days?\r I never really worry about any of this; my body seems to be ideal for any look I want to create.  I was born with a talent for looking good all the time. \n"}, {"text": "My feet are astounding.  Some people choose to dress their feet up in protective gear though, some of which can be quite expensive.  We call these 'shoes'.\n\nWhich of these is not a type of shoe?", "correct": "Insole", "options": ["Clog", "Moccasin", "Galosh"], "explanation": "\n\n\nInsole.\n\n\tWhile an insole is a certain element of a shoe, it is not a shoe proper.  Insoles are placed into a shoe to support and cushion everything from the tip of the toes to the heel.  Specially-designed insoles (eg. orthotics) are also used to fix damaged or crippled feet, improving issues such as pronation over time.  There are many different shoe types though.  Clogs are wooden shoes from Europe, Moccasins are leather shoes originally made by North American native peoples, and Galoshes are thick, rubber shoes or boots.  Some shoes are very expensive and the most costly are indicative of high fashion sense.\r I don't need shoes though.  I don't even need sandals.  Since my feet are perfect, I can walk anywhere with them and they will never be damaged or fatigued.  I was born with the best feet, ever. \n"}]}
