Since her debut, she's gone on to win the Best Actress Oscar (for \"Black Swan\"), act as a spokesmodel for Dior, and contribute significantly to charitable causes ranging from support for all-girls African schools to speaking out during the Time's Up/#MeToo campaign.  She appeared in \"Vox Lux\" in 2018. \n"}, {"text": "You may remember a BOSSING JAG from \"American Pie\" or \"Orange Is the New Black\".", "correct": "Jason Biggs", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJason Biggs.\n\n\tJason hit it big as Jim from the original cast of \"American Pie\", following the series through its first trilogy alongside Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Seann William Scott.  While his film career was stop-start in the years following this series, he did have a significant role on one of Netflix's first major TV shows, \"Orange Is the New Black\", playing lead actress Taylor Schilling's fianc\u00e9, Larry Bloom, in a handful of seasons.  Of note, he also appeared as the dirtbag in the music video for Wheatus' \"Teenage Dirtbag\". \n"}, {"text": "The NEW TALK SITE for this actress might be the Atlantic or Easttown, depending on the decade.", "correct": "KATE WINSLET", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nKATE WINSLET.\n\n\tOne of the most celebrated female actors of her generation, Kate Winslet began her career before her recognition in \"Titanic\" (she was Oscar-nominated for \"Hamlet\" two years before!).  She would ultimately win the Best Actress Oscar in 2008 for \"The Reader\".  She's also won Emmy Awards (one for \"Mare of Easttown\") and a Grammy (for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for her audiobook of \"Listen to the Storyteller\").  In 2012 she was also appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. \n"}, {"text": "For a scare you might suggest EYEHOLES JOLT MAN; he can see dead people.", "correct": "HALEY JOEL OSMENT", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nHALEY JOEL OSMENT.\n\n\tThough Osment's earlier roles, notably those in \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Pay It Forward\", may be regarded as his most popular and most celebrated, Osment continued to act through the years, especially in animated shows and as a voice actor in video games (like the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series).  Nonetheless, it's for \"The Sixth Sense\" that Osment received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the age of 11.  It was, then, his sixth movie release. \n"}, {"text": "This congenial actress CAN SKULL BOARD if she understands the gravity of it.", "correct": "SANDRA BULLOCK", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSANDRA BULLOCK.\n\n\tOne of the highest-paid female actors of the 2010s, Sandra Bullock was a hot commodity on the acting circuit as far back as the 1990s when she appeared in action films like \"Demolition Man\" and \"Speed\".  She made more of a name for herself in popular romantic comedies, often leaning into her comedic chops to become a leading lady (\"Miss Congeniality\" comes to mind).  She would win the Oscar for Best Actress in 2010 for her role in \"The Blind Side\". \n"}, {"text": "You'd think this actor would be of the MARVEL ILK, but he actually played Batman.", "correct": "VAL KILMER", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nVAL KILMER.\n\n\tAn action star staking his claim in the 1980s and 1990s, Val Kilmer was, at one time, one of Hollywood's most bankable stars; it's part of why he got the role of Bruce Wayne in Joel Schumacher's \"Batman Forever\".  In the late 2010s, Val Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent surgery that left him unable to act or speak in the same capacity he once did in his more prolific years.  Kilmer would write, shoot, and produce his own autobiographical film, \"Val\", which released in 2021. \n"}, {"text": "This talk show host and former child actress is a WRY DREAM BORER and an Angel.", "correct": "Drew Barrymore", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDrew Barrymore.\n\n\tDrew Barrymore, though part of a family with a long history in cinema, carved a path for herself on her own merits, appearing in films when she was as young as five years old (she was in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" when she was six!).  She has since had a long career in Hollywood cinema, at one time being part of the \"Charlie's Angels\" movie series and in a handful of Adam Sandler comedies.  She also starred on Netflix's \"Santa Clarita Diet\" for three seasons before becoming the host on her own syndicated talk show in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). \n"}, {"text": "COAL PAIN became an Oscar-winner on his eighth nomination.", "correct": "Al Pacino", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nAl Pacino.\n\n\tPacino started accumulating Oscar nods as far back as 1973 (with \"The Godfather\") and it took until 1993's \"Scent of a Woman\" before he finally took the prize (though he was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the same year for \"Glengarry Glen Ross\").  His range, over more than fifty years of acting, has been immense.  Not only has he been one of the grittiest action actors (in \"Scarface\"), but he's been a standard in Scorsese's mob movie roster, the lead in the highly-emotional \"Angels in America\" adaptation, and a multiple-Tony-winning thespian on Broadway. \n"}, {"text": "There's a CHILL REHEARSAL GLEAM when you consider what's at stake for this TV and film actress.", "correct": "SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSARAH MICHELLE GELLAR.\n\n\tThough Sarah Michelle Gellar is likely most well-known for her lead role in TV's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" across its eight seasons, she also persisted as a scream queen throughout the 1990s and 2000s, appearing in many of the teen slasher franchises of the day (and even starring in \"The Grudge\" when the J-horror wave occurred).  She would marry her \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and \"Scooby-Doo\" co-star, Freddie Prinze Jr., in 2002, eventually pivoting back to main roles in TV series like \"Ringer\", \"The Crazy Ones\" (alongside Robin Williams), and Netflix's animated series, \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\". \n"}, {"text": "There's no need to be stuck in the middle with QUARTET NATION INN; this filmmaker is inglourious.", "correct": "QUENTIN TARANTINO", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nQUENTIN TARANTINO.\n\n\tTarantino became a massive auteur filmmaker in the 1990s when \"Pulp Fiction\" won the Palme d'Or, and he continued to release shocking, gritty, genre-glorifying films over the course of his career, careening into blaxploitation in \"Jackie Brown\", martial arts revenge films with \"Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2\", revisionist war stories with \"Inglourious Basterds\", and westerns with \"Django Unchained\" and \"The Hateful Eight\".  Though known for his hot takes, Tarantino is considered by many to be a film junkie and, love him or hate him, he's one of the most celebrated directors of his era. \n"}]}
