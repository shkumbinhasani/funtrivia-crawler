On which city was the strictly-uranium bomb dropped?", "correct": "Hiroshima", "options": ["Kyoto", "Nagasaki", "Tokyo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHiroshima.\n\n\tThe 'Little Boy' bomb is known as a gun-barrel-type atomic bomb. It is estimated that less than 1 kilogram of uranium-235 fissioned, producing an explosion equivalent of 15 to 20 kilotons of TNT. Plutonium was the core material used in the 'Fat Man' bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  It's core was surrounded by uranium which acted as a tamper. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following minerals does NOT contain uranium?", "correct": "gypsum", "options": ["carnotite", "pitchblende", "tobernite"], "explanation": "\n\n\ngypsum.\n\n"}]}
