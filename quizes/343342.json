{"id": "343342", "name": "\"The First Time\" Quiz | 'Glee' - Season 3 | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Glee", "Episodes", "Season 3"], "questions": [{"text": "Who suggests that Blaine and Rachel lose their virginity for the sake of the school play?", "correct": "Artie", "options": ["Santana", "Finn", "Puck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nArtie.\n\n\tArtie rolls through the halls feeling really good about himself; things have been looking up for him since he started directing the school musical and he's realized that the key to getting things done is bossing people around and having opinions on everything-- even things he doesn't have knowledge about. He, Emma, and Bieste oversee a rehearsal of \"Tonight\" performed as a duet by Rachel and Blaine.  Bieste is moved to tears but Artie makes a note that the two of them lack passion.  He asks them, rather blatantly, if they've lost their virginity (at which point both Emma and Bieste leave uncomfortably) and they both claim to be waiting for the right moment. Artie suggests that perhaps they can't convey the proper emotion when they haven't experienced one of the most primal urges of humanity. \n"}, {"text": "According to Blaine, why is tearing Kurt's clothes off too tall an order?", "correct": "Because of the layers", "options": ["Kurt would need to buy a replacement outfit", "Because Kurt giggles too much", "Because neither of them can sew"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBecause of the layers.\n\n\tFinn helps Rachel put up campaign posters in the school hallways and she asks who he's voting for.  When she makes it clear that she's confident and excited for their future he informs her that a football talent scout is coming from Ohio State to recruit for next year.  Rachel is, surprisingly, thrilled with this as it gets him out of Lima on a brighter path.  Finn decides to invite her over since Burt and Carol are out for the week.  She accepts the invitation.\rKurt talks to Blaine about their relationship and Kurt feels horrible for making Blaine wait before they commit to a more physical relationship.  Blaine says he's okay with it though-- he could never be comfortable unless Kurt were comfortable as well.  Kurt asks him why he doesn't, in a fit of passion, just rip his clothes off; Blaine explains that Kurt wears too many layers. \n"}, {"text": "What song by Billy Joel do the Warblers perform with Blaine?", "correct": "Uptown Girl", "options": ["Piano Man", "New York State of Mind", "Only the Good Die Young"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUptown Girl.\n\n\tArtie finds Coach Bieste welding in the auditorium and he asks her about her own relationships (because she fled when he brought up sex earlier).  She does say, however, that she has seen a guy around who she's been interested in: Cooter Menkins.  He's the recruiter from Ohio State but she thinks he's not interested in her.  Little does she know, he actually is very much interested; she just deflects his advances.\rBlaine takes a visit to Dalton Academy to find the Warblers practicing a new version of Billy Joel's \"Uptown Girl\"; he immediately falls into their movements without a hitch and it seems like one new Warbler has eyes for him.  After their performance, Blaine invites them all to see him perform in \"West Side Story\".  The new boy, Sebastian, accepts on their behalf and asks him to coffee. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these characters claims to have a bucket list?", "correct": "Kurt", "options": ["Puck", "Blaine", "Rachel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKurt.\n\n\tOver coffee, Sebastian asks Blaine why he left Dalton Academy and Blaine explains that his heart is at McKinley.  Sebastian suggests that they meet again.  In the meantime, Rachel and Santana rehearse their performance of \"A Boy Like That\" from \"West Side Story\".\rIn the locker room, Finn asks Puck a personal question about protection; Puck instantly thinks that Finn is cheating on Rachel but that's not the case.  He also states that he never uses protection and it's worked out 99% of the time.\rCoach Bieste has the boys sit down for a quick meeting to introduce Cooter Menkins (who, once more, tries to flirt with her).  Finn knows that it's his chance to make a good impression.\rBlaine asks Kurt if he thinks that they're too sheltered and if they should get out and be more adventurous.  Kurt agrees-- his bucket list, for example, has scores of items (including becoming the CEO of Logo and laying a rose at the birthplace of Noel Coward).  Kurt says that they're young and have all the time in the world to be adventurous.  Kurt says that there's no time like the present. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the gay bar in West Lima?", "correct": "Scandals", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nScandals.\n\n\tArtie decides to act as a certain 'director' again and speaks to Cooter Menkins in his office (the auditorium) about Coach Bieste.  Cooter says that Bieste has been rebuffing all of his advances, even the most explicitly obvious ones, so he's at a loss as to what to do.  Artie explains the he needs to ask again, but make it even more audience.\rBlaine heads to the Lima Bean with Sebastian and Blaine says that he has a boyfriend.  Kurt shows up at this point (making Blaine fairly awkward) and sits down, linking his arm in Blaine's.  Sebastian invites the two of them to Scandals in West Lima and Blaine graciously turns him down.  Kurt, on the other hand, thinks it would be a good idea for them to get fake IDs and go to have a good time and to start crossing things off their bucket lists. \n"}, {"text": "Where did Mike's father find out that his son was in the school play?", "correct": "At home while his wife was on the phone", "options": ["At school, walking by the casting list", "While driving by, on a sign", "At the funeral home while reading the program"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAt home while his wife was on the phone.\n\n\tRachel and Finn enjoy dinner together and Rachel suggests that they go and snuggle by the fire.  This progresses almost naturally, but Finn asks her why they're doing this now, especially since she wanted to wait until she won a Tony.  She says that she's doing this because there's no better time than now, with him... and because she needs to before the opening night of the play.  Finn realizes that she's really going ahead with it to improve her acting.\rAt school, Mike's father stops at his locker to tell his son to quit the school play and grow up.  Mike says that he doesn't want to; he wants to be a dancer and not a doctor.  His father says that until he changes his mind, Mike isn't his son.  Mike, stubbornly, responds that he doesn't have a father because he wants to follow his dreams. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the only member of the Celibacy Club to suggest that Rachel sleep with Finn?", "correct": "Tina", "options": ["Santana", "Quinn", "Brittany"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTina.\n\n\tIn the locker room, Cooter speaks with Coach Bieste and hands her a bouquet of flowers, inviting her to dinner.  Bieste is shocked that he would consider doing this and her lack of self-esteem shows through.  He assures her that he thinks she's a beautiful woman and he insists that they're going out for dinner after the big game.\rRachel calls an emergency meeting of the Celibacy Club to ask about what she should do about Finn.  Quinn suggests she wait-- it's not worth it to give up her virginity as she can never get it back.  Santana, likewise, says to wait, but only because she slept with Finn and said it wasn't worth it.  Brittany says her first time was with an alien.  Tina is the only differing view; she had a great experience because she was with someone she loved.  She and Mike took it slow but they knew it was right for them.  Rachel and Santana perform \"I Have a Love\" on stage and Rachel makes her decision. \n"}, {"text": "Kurt runs into a teacher he knows at the gay bar.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tKurt and Blaine arrive at Scandals with their fake IDs and meet with Sebastian at the bar; Blaine gets a beer while Kurt has a Shirley Temple (as he's the designated driver).  Kurt watches Blaine dance before none other than Karofsky appears at the bar.  It turns out he left McKinley after the previous year but he's found comfort at the gay bar; he feels accepted.  They clink their drinks to baby steps, but Kurt decides to jump onto the dance floor, cut between Sebastian and Blaine, and go wild.\rKurt brings Blaine to the car and Blaine tries to convince him to sleep with him in the back seat.  Kurt refuses though, because Blaine had some drinks and because he danced with Sebastian.  Blaine says he's just trying to be spontaneous, but it's too late.  He decides to walk home. \n"}, {"text": "Mike Chang's father appears to watch his son perform in the musical.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tOn opening night, Blaine and Rachel both admit that they're still virgins.  Rachel says she wants to cancel the show so that the audience isn't slighted.  Artie finds that his nerves are shot; he thinks that everything has gone wrong.  The cast appears, however, to thank him for everything they've done.  They hand him a bouquet of flowers and he deeply thanks them for believing in him.  Directing them and bossing them around has given him tons of confidence.\rThe performance begins and the kids take the stage.  Even Rory, who can barely switch his Irish accent around enough to say his lines, makes an appearance.  Soon, the cast starts into the song \"America\" in full swing.  Mike performs for his mother who watches proudly from the audience.  His dad isn't present.\rBlaine and Rachel aren't sure how to follow the performance but they give it their all. \n"}, {"text": "Who does Cooter show interest in in the way of football recruitment?", "correct": "Shane", "options": ["Finn", "Puck", "Mike"], "explanation": "\n\n\nShane.\n\n\tKurt speaks to Blaine after the performance and Kurt congratulates him on his performance.  Blaine states that Sebastian means nothing to him and Kurt says that he's a bit too romantic to have gone through with anything in the parking lot.  They decide to skip Artie's after-party to spend the night together.\rRachel stops at Finn's after the performance and she thanks him for the flowers he sent.  He tells her that he's home alone and the football coach didn't like him.  Instead of showing interest in him, Cooter showed interest in Shane, Mercedes' boyfriend.  Cooter assures him that if his football career ends in high school, his life doesn't.  Rachel says he's growing out of his dreams so they're going to have to find some new ones for him.  Rachel says that she still loves him and she feels ready to remember their moments together for the rest of her life.\rRachel and Blaine duet to \"One Hand, One Heart\".  At Blaine's house, Blaine and Kurt share their bed together.  At Finn's, Rachel and Finn spend the night next to the fireplace. \n"}]}
