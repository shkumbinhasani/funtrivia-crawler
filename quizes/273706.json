{"id": "273706", "name": "Are You Kidding Me? Trivia Quiz | Baseball | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Sports Trivia", "Baseball", "           MLB Awards"], "questions": [{"text": "In 1941, I hit 37 home runs and even batted .406 in the season, yet I lost the MVP award to Joe DiMaggio of the Yankees.  Who am I?  ", "correct": "Ted Williams", "options": ["Lou Boudreau", "Joe Cronin", "Bill Dickey"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTed Williams.\n\n\tThe others weren't in the top ten voting for the MVP in 1941.  DiMaggio hit 43 doubles to Williams' 33, 11 triples to Williams' 3, and had 193 hits to Williams' 185.  This was a somewhat legitimate MVP award, although Ted hit over .400, and Ted had been allegedly 'blackballed' due to his avoidance of the media. \n"}, {"text": "Hello, my name is Jim Palmer.  I pitched for the Baltimore Orioles in 1973, and won the Cy Young award in that season.  I went 22-9 with 158 strikeouts in the season.  Some fans think that I didn't deserve the award being as how another pitcher who went 21-16, struck out a modern day Major League record 383 batters.  Who was this pitcher who finished as the runner-up to me?", "correct": "Nolan Ryan", "options": ["Orlando Pena", "Gaylord Perry", "Woodie Fryman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNolan Ryan.\n\n\tThe 1973 season was the closest that Ryan had ever come to the reality of a Cy Young award.  Nolan broke Sandy Koufax's single season record of 382 strikeouts in 1965, when he struck out the last batter of his season in 1973 as a California Angel.  Gaylord Perry of the Indians went 19-19 in 1973.  Pena of the Orioles went only 1-1 in the season with one save along with only 23 strikeouts.  Fryman went 6-13 for the Tigers.  Woodie's best season was 12-9 as a rookie with the Pirates in 1966. \n"}, {"text": "I took the Toronto Blue Jays to their first World Series appearance in 1992, and even won that World Series over the Braves.  Our team had the best season record in the franchise's history also.  Yet somehow, I finished only fourth in the Manager of the Year award balloting.  Fourth?  That made no sense to me.  Who am I?", "correct": "Cito Gaston", "options": ["Bill Plummer", "Tony LaRussa", "Tom Lasorda"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCito Gaston.\n\n\tThe Manager of the Year award went to LaRussa of the Athletics, who took Oakland to an identical record of 96-66 as the Blue Jays did, and yet lost to the Blue Jays in the AL Championship series.  The other managers listed didn't win more than 65 games in 1992.  Lasorda was with the Dodgers and Plummer with the Mariners.  The second and third place balloting for the Manager of the Year award in 1992 went to Phil Garner of the Brewers, and Johnny Oates of the Orioles, respectively.  Neither the Brewers or the Orioles made it to the playoffs in the season. \n"}, {"text": "My name is Babe Ruth.  Excuse me, the Great Babe Ruth.  I hit 60 home runs in the 1927 season for the Yankees, but yet didn't win the season MVP, while my  teammate who hit only 47 home runs in the season won it.  Who won the MVP in 1927?", "correct": "Lou Gehrig", "options": ["Schoolboy Rowe", "Hank Greenberg", "Bob Feller"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLou Gehrig.\n\n\tThe others were never Yankees, and did not begin their Major League careers until the 1930s.  Although Ruth hit a massive 60 home runs in the season, breaking his own season record of 59 in 1921, he had only 192 hits and batted .356 for the Yankees in the season.  Lou Gehrig, in a quiet way, had 218 hits and batted .373 in the season along with his own 47 home runs.  It was the first of two AL MVPs that Lou would win, including the Triple Crown award in 1934. \n"}, {"text": "My name is Russ Ortiz of the Braves, and I went 21-7 in 2003, but still finished fourth in the Cy Young voting.  The Cy Young winner was a pitcher who went 2-3 in the season.  Who was that pitcher?", "correct": "Eric Gagne", "options": ["Shawn Estes", "Oliver Perez", "Tom Glavine"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEric Gagne.\n\n\tIn 82 innings pitched, Gagne struck out 137 batters with a 1.20 ERA along with 55 saves.  Ortiz helped the 2003 Braves to the NL Eastern Division crown, but lost NL Division series 3-2 to the Chicago Cubs.  Jason Schmidt of the Giants was the runner-up to the Cy, then Mark Prior of the Cubs finished third. \n"}, {"text": "I am Chicago Cubs' first baseman Derrek Lee.  Although I hit more home runs in the 2005 season that the MVP winner, I also had a higher batting average of .335, and yet I finished with only one first place vote.  I finished third?  Who did I lose the MVP award to in that season?", "correct": "Albert Pujols", "options": ["Ken Griffey Jr", "Jim Edmonds", "David Eckstein"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAlbert Pujols.\n\n\tThe others listed did not make into the top 20 of the MVP voting in 2005.  Lee had more hits, more home runs, and a higher season batting average than Pujols.  But, because the Cubs didn't make the playoffs in 2005, supposedly, Lee wasn't a MVP value.  Runner-up  MVP Andruw Jones who hit .263 for the Braves to Lee's .335, also had 45 hits less than Lee.  Pujols of the Cardinals hit 41 home runs with a .330 batting average, compared to Lee's 46 home runs and a .335 average. \n"}, {"text": "Although I won only three games less than the 1993 AL Cy Young winner, I also lost two games less than he did and had a lower ERA in the season.  I even had 150 more strikeouts than he did, but still was the runner-up to the Cy Young award.  My name is Randy Johnson, and I lost the Cy Young award in 1993 to who?  ", "correct": "Jack McDowell", "options": ["Charlie Root", "Christy Mathewson", "Walter Johnson"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJack McDowell.\n\n\tThe Cy Young award began in 1956, and all the others had died long before the Cy Young award was created.  McDowell of the Indians went 22-10 in the season while Johnson went 19-8.  Sam had an ERA of 3.37 to Randy's 3.24.  McDowell also 158 strikeouts to Johnson's 308 in the season.  Johnson would go on to show them all, winning five Cy Young awards in his career. \n"}, {"text": "Willie Randolph took his New York Mets to a NL Eastern Division crown in 2006.  The Mets pulled off a 97-65 record, the most wins that the Mets had experienced in seven seasons.  Willie lost the NL Manager of the Year award to someone who took his team to a fourth place finish and a 78-84 record.  Who did Randolph lose the award to?", "correct": "Joe Girardi", "options": ["Jim Leyland", "Joe Torre", "Mike Scioscia"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe Girardi.\n\n\tThe others were American League managers in 2006.  Girardi and his Florida Marlins finished fourth in the NL East, 19 games behind the Mets.  Girardi did so poorly with the team, that he wasn't asked to return in 2007, but yet still won the award. \n"}, {"text": "In 1947, Boston's Ted Williams led the league in home runs, RBIs, runs, batting average, on-base pct, slugging pct, total bases, walks, and extra base hits.  Even with all this, Ted was still the runner-up MVP to who?", "correct": "Joe DiMaggio", "options": ["George Kell", "Hank Greenberg", "Luke Appling"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJoe DiMaggio.\n\n\tWilliams batted almost .020 points higher and had 12 more home runs than DiMaggio.  Still, because of Williams' dislike for the media, lost yet another MVP.  It was the third time that Ted took a backseat to DiMaggio in the MVP department. \n"}, {"text": "The 1928 MVP balloting was a fiasco.  The winner, Mickey Cochrane of the Athletics, batted .085 points less than the runner-up, hit less home runs, and had 104 less hits.  Who was it that put up Hall of Fame numbers, and yet somehow finished second for the MVP? ", "correct": "Heinie Manush", "options": ["Stan Musial", "Gil Hodges", "Duke Snider"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHeinie Manush.\n\n\tThe others did not begin their careers until the 1940s.  Manush was in his sixth season in the big leagues, and his first with the St. Louis Browns of the American League in 1928.  Heinie set many career highs in 1928, but it was all for not.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1964. \n"}]}
