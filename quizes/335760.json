{"id": "335760", "name": "The 1st Battalion of British Infantry Regiments Quiz | World | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "World Trivia", " Military Matters", "  U.K. Military"], "questions": [{"text": "At which battle of the Crimean War did the 93rd Highland Regiment (Sutherland Highlanders) win the accolade 'The thin red streak tipped with steel' more popularly known as 'The Thin Red Line'?", "correct": "The Battle of Balaklava", "options": ["The Siege of Sevastopol", "The Battle of Alma", "The Battle of Inkerman"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Battle of Balaklava.\n\n\tOn the 25th of October 1854 the Regiment fought off an attack by the massed Russian cavalry.  Correspondent for the Times newspaper, W.H. Russell, described the scene and because of this action the Russians abandoned their attempt at capturing Balaklava.  The Battle of Alma took place on 20th of September 1854, The Battle of Inkerman took place on 5th of November 1854 and the siege of Sevastopol from September 1854 until September 1855. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name given to the unique head-dress worn by members of the Royal Irish Regiment?", "correct": "The Caubeen", "options": ["The Corbett", "The Cauberet", "Cor Boru"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Caubeen.\n\n\tThe Caubeen is a large bonnet which, historically, bears more resemblance to a (Scottish) highland bonnet than to anything in Irish culture.  The Royal Irish Regiment Caubeens are dark green and worn with a dark green hackle (feathers) behind the cap badge. The remainder are figments of my imagination. \n"}, {"text": "From which area in the North of England did that fine Regiment, The Green Howards, predominantly recruit?", "correct": "North Yorkshire", "options": ["Lancashire", "Cumbria", "Tyneside"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNorth Yorkshire.\n\n\tThe Green Howards have always recruited mainly from the North Yorkshire area and their Regimental Museum, which is always worth a visit, is situated in the town of Richmond.  It would be a very brave man that says that they recruited from Lancashire! \n"}, {"text": "The Regimental motto of The Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Cameron) is 'Cuidich'n Righ'. Translated from the Scots Gaelic, what does this mean?", "correct": "Help the King", "options": ["Help Bonnie Prince Charlie", "Help the Queen", "Save the Regiment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHelp the King.\n\n\tThe motto comes from its usage as the motto of the Clan MacKenzie, whose tartan the Regiment also wore. \n"}, {"text": "The Royal Welch Fusiliers wore an embellishment from the collar of their tunics known as 'The Flash'.  It goes back to the time when soldiers often wore pigtails that were powdered and greased and was worn to prevent the tunic becoming soiled.  How many ribbons did 'The Flash' consist of?", "correct": "5", "options": ["4", "6", "7"], "explanation": "\n\n\n5.\n\n\tWhen, in July 1808, the Army instructed that the hair was to be cut close to the neck, \"The Flash\" became superfluous and the Regiment was ordered to remove it.  When King William IV heard this he was pleased to approve the wearing of \"The Flash\", \"as a peculiarity whereby to mark the dress of that distinguished Regiment\". \n"}, {"text": "Chain of Command - Each day, the Commanding Officer of a unit would ensure that his orders were passed down to the men under his command through what means?", "correct": "Battalion Part One Orders", "options": ["By hand written notes through his Adjutant", "Company Detail", "Shouting them out across the parade square"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBattalion Part One Orders.\n\n\tBattalion (Bn) Part One Orders are issued by the Commanding Officer each working day of the week and are published/posted within all departments within the unit.  These orders will include major parade timings, the names of Battalion level staff on duty for the day and any other announcements and instructions that contribute to the smooth daily running of the unit. The CO is far to busy to be issuing hand written notes and when it comes to shouting... well, that is the job of the Regimental Sergeant Major!  Company Detail is published daily, like Part Ones, by each Officer Commanding a sub-unit (Company etc).  These orders also detail parade timings, training requirements and other disciplinary matters. \n"}, {"text": "Which present day Regiment, which used to be one of the largest in the British Army, has battalions known by nicknames such as The Vikings, The Poachers and The Steelbacks?", "correct": "The Royal Anglian Regiment", "options": ["The Rifles", "The Royal Regiment of Scotland", "The Royal Welsh Regiment"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Royal Anglian Regiment.\n\n\tThe Royal Anglian Regiment consists of two Regular Battalions (The Vikings and The Poachers) and one Territorial Battalion (The Steelbacks). The Royal Regiment of Scotland consists of five Regular Battalions and two Territorial Battalions, and The Royal Welsh Regiment consists of two Regular Battalions and one Territorial Battalion. \n"}, {"text": "The British soldier's current personal weapon is of a 'bullpup' design.  What is this weapon known as?", "correct": "SA80", "options": ["H&K G3", "L1A1 SLR", "Colt M16"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSA80.\n\n\tThe current personal weapon issued to infantry soldiers is the SA80 in 5.56mm calibre.  Infamous in recent years for being unreliable and prone to jamming in certain situations and theatres of war, a number of improvements have been made in the last few years and the SA80 is now considered to be a reliable infantry rifle. Even if, in this author's opinion, the ammunition is somewhat underpowered.  This is something that could never be said of its predecessor the L1A1 SLR - If your target went down, he stayed down! \rThe Heckler and Koch G3 in various forms is issued by armed forces all over the world, as is the Colt M16. \n"}, {"text": "What rank structure - junior to senior - can be expected to be found within the officer ranks of a Rifle Company within a British Infantry Battalion?", "correct": "2nd Lieutenant/Lieutenant, Captain and Major", "options": ["Captain, Warrant Officer Class 1, Major", "Lieutenant Colonel, Captain, Colour Sergeant", "Warrant Officer Class 2, Lieutenant, Major"], "explanation": "\n\n\n2nd Lieutenant/Lieutenant, Captain and Major.\n\n\t2nd Lieutenant and Lieutenant are junior officer ranks and would most likely be found commanding a platoon of soldiers.  An officer of the rank of Captain would often hold the post of Company Second-in-Command and would be subordinate to the Company Commander who would usually be at the rank of Major.  Warrant Officer Class 1 and 2 are the most senior Non-Commissioned Officer ranks (NCOs) and a Colour Sergeant holds a rank that falls between Sergeant and Warrant Officer.  A Lieutenant Colonel is a senior commissioned rank and would usually hold the post of Battalion Commanding Officer. \n"}, {"text": "This author, unless you hadn't guessed by now, was a soldier in the British Army for a number of years.  My Regiment features somewhere else within this quiz and its soldiers wore a specific type of parade dress and are most famous for an action during the Crimean War.  Can you identify this Regiment?", "correct": "1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)", "options": ["1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment", "2nd Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment (The Poachers)", "1st Battalion The Green Howards"], "explanation": "\n\n\n1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's).\n\n\tI served for a number of years as a member of a rifle company in 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's). The parade dress that I refer to consisted of kilt, sporran, diced hose, spats and khaki dress jacket all finished off with a glengarry and cap badge.\r The action in which one of my Regiment's forebears took part, and for which  we were most famous, for took place at the Battle of Balaklava on the 25th of October 1854, when the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders repulsed an attack by the massed squadrons of Russian Cavalry.  Not concerned with forming a British Square to defend themselves, the Highlanders formed up in two ranks facing the charging enemy.  At 600 yards the Highlanders delivered their first volley at the Russian forces.  This range proved to be too great and this volley proved to be largely ineffective.  As the Russians galloped forward and reached 200 yards the Highlanders then delivered a second volley.  This withering barrage of shot proved to be highly effective and the charging Russians were stopped virtually dead in their tracks. In the confusion that followed the Russians wheeled around and attempted to take the Highlanders right flank.  Once again they were checked by a furious volley from the Highlanders Grenadier Company and with this the Russian cavalry that remained went \"Files About\" and ran desperately toward the safety of their own guns.\r This action was reported in detail by the Times correspondent, William Russell, whose piece immortalised the Regiment as \"The thin red streak, tipped with steel\" which has, over time, become the \"The Thin Red Line\" a term that has been used to refer to many British Regiments. \n"}]}
