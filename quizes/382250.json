To that point he'd released two albums that were commercial failures despite garnering strong critical acclaim. This single, filled with gothic grandeur amidst a rock and roll fairy tale tinged with a romantic realism, would be the icebreaker that tore down the walls to mainstream acceptance for Bruce.\r The \"Wall of Sound\" was a formula employed by Phil Spector that would imbue the songs he produced with a \"dense orchestral aesthetic\" that sounded bigger on radio. Christgau noted that Springsteen embraced this on \"Born to Run\" indicating that \"it was the fulfillment of everything \"Be My Baby\" was about and lots more.\" Critic Greil Marcus agreed by stating that the song was \"a '56 Chevy running on melted down Crystals' records.\"\r Pollucci19 brings us this question based on a song recommendation from Iceman61. \n"}, {"text": "The first single from Coldplay's fourth album, when translated from Spanish into English, means 'long live life'.

On the album itself, 'Viva la Vida' segues directly into the anti-war song 'Violet Hill'. 'Viva la Vida' is the second song from the album, and is named after a painting by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. It was downloaded so many times that it became iTunes' best-selling song of 2008.\r This hit single was suggested for the Setlist by Fifiona81 and the question was brought to us by Kankurette. \n"}, {"text": "Mungo Jerry were a British rock group that had nine hits in their native UK in the '70s. However what was the name of the song that gave them a worldwide number top ten hit in 1970?", "correct": "In The Summertime", "options": ["Me and You and a Dog Named Boo", "Leaving On a Jet Plane", "The Pushbike Song"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn The Summertime.\n\n\tThe unusually named band comes from \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\", in T.S. Eliot's \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\". \"In the Summertime\" was their debut single and biggest hit. It was one of the the first British songs to sell more than ten million copies, eventually selling thirty million copies.\r Thanks to 1nn1 for this primer on the UK classic suggested by MiraJane. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these songs from The Doors shares its title with an album by the same band?", "correct": "Waiting For the Sun", "options": ["The Unknown Soldier", "Hello, I Love You", "Summer's Almost Gone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWaiting For the Sun.\n\n\t\"Waiting for the Sun\" was originally intended to appear on the album of the same name, the group's third album released in 1968. However, recording for the song was not finished in time. Instead, it appeared two albums later on The Doors' fifth album, \"Morrison Hotel\" (1970).

While it was co-written by Mr Rutherford, it is about his co-writer B.A Robertson's father who passed away prompting Mr Robertson to write the song. Paul Carrack was the vocalist. \"All I Need Is A Miracle\" was another hit for the band. The other two songs were hits for Marc Cohn, \"Silver Thunderbird\" was about the passing of the singer's father. \r Mommakat recommended this song and it was fleshed out into a question by 1nn1. \n"}, {"text": "At the end of which Beatles' track from 1967 can John Lennon be heard saying \"cranberry sauce\", although according to conspiracy theorists, he is saying \"I buried Paul\"?", "correct": "Strawberry Fields Forever", "options": ["Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "Penny Lane", "Getting Better"], "explanation": "\n\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever.\n\n\tConspiracy theorists will have you believe that Paul died 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike. \"Proof\" of his death is widely available with examples such as \"turn me on, dead man\" being heard when \"Revolution 9\" is played backwards, the fact that the Beatles retired from touring in 1967 and of course the (in)famous \"Abbey Road\" album cover in which Lennon is perceived as an angel, Starr as an undertaker, Harrison as a gravedigger and McCartney as a corpse.\r Quizzing is easy with eyes closed...\rThanks to 480154st for this Beatles question!

Because it was released as a B-side \"Colour My World\" never charted on it's own but \"Make Me Smile\" and \"Beginnings\" did.\r Melokia56 brought us this b-side suggestion, but Sally0Malley brought it to our quiz! \n"}, {"text": "Which operatic composition is often played at graduation ceremonies in Latin America and was said to be inspirational to the composer of the Philippines' national anthem, \"Lupang Hinirang\"?", "correct": "Triumphal March", "options": ["The 1812 Overture", "Pomp and Circumstance", "Joyeuse Marche"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTriumphal March.\n\n\tThe \"Triumphal March\", is performed in Act II of \"Aida\", when Radames leads the Egyptian army on its return following their victory over the Ethiopians. \rAlong with the Spanish anthem \"Marcha Real\" and the French anthem \"La Marseillaise\" the march inspired the Philippine National Anthem, according to its composer, Juli\u00e1n Felipe.

Bats appear to fly quickly and erratically, hence the connotation that to fly in that manner is to do so recklessly. During these times they were also linked to witches who, in turn, were linked to Hell.\r The song \"Bat Out of Hell\" is the title track of Meatloaf's debut album, released in 1977. Running at just a shade under ten minutes in length, the track was written by Jim Steinman, who drew influences from a number of sources. Amongst these were a litany of teenage tragedy songs from the 1960s such as \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" and, interestingly, the grandeur in Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run\" song. It seems unsurprising then to find that Roy Bittan (piano and keyboards) and Max Weinberg (drums), both members of Springsteen's E Street Band, made guest appearances on the track.\r Pollucci19 wrote us this question based on a request from Plodd. \n"}, {"text": "What word describes how Madonna feels \"For You\", Beyonce feels \"In Love\" and the state of Ozzy Osbourne's \"Train\" to give a Gnarls Barkley hit from 2006?", "correct": "Crazy", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrazy.\n\n\tOzzy was the first of this \"crazy gang\" to chart with a crazy record when he released \"Crazy Train\" in 1980.
