Ironically, \"Terminator: Salvation\" is the one movie of the series in which no one time travels.  However, it is necessary that you see and understand at least the first \"Terminator\" movie to know what's happening. At the very end of \"Terminator\" it is revealled that Kyle not only was sent back in time by John Connor to stop John Connor's mother from getting killed by the terminator, but he also impregnated her, which resulted in the birth of John Connor, which means Kyle was the father of John Connor, although Kyle had come from the future. In the future, during the war between the people and the machines, John Connor was older than Kyle.  Kyle was still a teenager when he had been captured by the machines.  The \"Resistance\" made plans to blow up the machine headquarters where Kyle and a bunch of people where being held.  John Connor told the \"Resistance\" leaders that they should not kill innocent people, but the leaders insisted this was a chance to destroy most of the machines patrolling that area.  The real reason John Connor said this was to prevent the death of Kyle, which would prevent Kyle from growing up and getting in the time machine in the future to be sent into the past, the year 1984, to become John Connor's father.  This is one of those time travel movies in which it will happen because it did happen (such as \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" and \"Time Rider\", etc.). \n"}, {"text": "In what movie does Freddy Krueger kiss Jason's mother?", "correct": "Freddy Vs Jason", "options": ["Jason Goes to Hell", "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey", "Jason and the Argonauts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFreddy Vs Jason.\n\n\tOne of the many sequels which copies \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\", the movie \"Freddy Vs Jason\" involved killers from \"Friday the 13th Part Two\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" repeatedly \"not killing\" each other.

It all began when a sun went supernova and destroyed planet Romulus in the future.
