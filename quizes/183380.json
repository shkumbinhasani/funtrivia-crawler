Her apparent rebirth to Christianity created strange bedfellows in this battle. In the end, it didn't matter that she was okay with her own death sentence. No matter what happens - she can't win ('if you live they're gonna make you a campaigner - if you die they'll make you a grave') - she lost control of her soul and her life when she took another - just as we do when instituting the death penalty. 'that's why killing don't pay' was meant for us and K. Faye. \" \n"}, {"text": "This song by Emily was an unlisted track on the \"Come On Now Social\" album.
