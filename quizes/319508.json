{"id": "319508", "name": "The Music of \"Glee\" Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television D-G", "Glee"], "questions": [{"text": "Each of the kids in New Directions is forced to audition in the Pilot episode.  Tina performs a song by which artist?", "correct": "Katy Perry", "options": ["Kelly Clarkson", "Lady Gaga", "Taylor Swift"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKaty Perry.\n\n\tGetting the kids to sign up, Will Schuester makes them perform a small audition (and no one is ever cut from the team).  Mercedes performs Aretha Franklin's \"RESPECT\", Kurt performs \"Mr. Cellophane\" from the Broadway and film versions of \"Chicago\", and Tina performs Katy Perry's 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl\" (with obscene gestures and all).  Although Artie also signs up, he is not shown performing.  His first song is \"Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat\" in which he has a solo.  It's also performed in the Pilot episode. \n"}, {"text": "Rachel performs \"On My Own\" to audition for New Directions in the Pilot episode.  What Broadway musical is it from?", "correct": "Les Miserables", "options": ["Rent", "The King and I", "Spring Awakening"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLes Miserables.\n\n\tAfter Rachel gives the story of her past and her future dreams of stardom, she performs her version of the song for Mr. Schuester in the auditorium.  She also performed the song in front of her video camera to put up on her MySpace page.  Although she gets negative comments on it from the Cheerios, she doesn't let it bring her down.\rThe song never appeared on the \"Glee: Volume 1\" soundtrack upon its release.  Coincidentally, Lea Michelle, who plays Rachel on the show, also played Eponine in \"Les Miserables\" and sang the song on Broadway. \n"}, {"text": "\"Can't Fight This Feeling\" is Finn's first song on the show (as seen in the Pilot episode).  Where is he seen singing it?", "correct": "In the shower", "options": ["On the football field", "In his car", "In class"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn the shower.\n\n\tSearching for a male lead for the slowly-growing Glee Club, Mr. Schuester comes across Finn as he's singing REO Speedwagon's \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" in the locker room showers.  After this, Will creates a clever plan to somewhat 'force' Finn into performing as a part of New Directions through blackmail.  Cory Monteith, who plays Finn on the show, auditioned for the role with this song via a video.\r\"Can't Fight This Feeling\" was released by REO Speedwagon in 1984 and it hit #1 on the US Pop Music Chart in the same year. \n"}, {"text": "In the Pilot episode, the first song performed by both Rachel and Finn was \"You're the One That I Want\".  What film is the song from?", "correct": "Grease", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrease.\n\n\tReaching #1 in many countries, \"You're the One That I Want\" is one of the most popular songs from the Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta musical film, \"Grease\".  Rachel and Finn sing as the main characters while Tina, Artie, Kurt, and Mercedes pick up the back-up vocals for the song.  Mercedes cuts off the others part-way through their rehearsal claiming that she's more of a Beyonce than a Kelly Rowland and that she needs a more prevalent part.  When Kurt reminds them all that this is the best they've ever sounded, they decide to sit back and try again.\r\"You're the One That I Want\" was never released as a single and it didn't appear on the \"Glee: Volume 1\". \n"}, {"text": "In the Pilot episode, the Glee Club travels to see Vocal Adrenaline, their rivals and reigning champions.  What song do they perform?", "correct": "\"Rehab\" by Amy Winehouse", "options": ["\"Disturbia\" by Rihanna", "\"Clumsy\" by Fergie", "\"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Rehab\" by Amy Winehouse.\n\n\t\"Rehab\" was the winner of three major Grammy Awards in 2008 and it charted on four different Billboard Charts.\rNew Directions is taken by Will and Emma to Carmel High School's performance night across town so that they can scout out the competition.  When they arrive they find that the school's Glee Club is more than capable of being high-quality performers.  They sit stunned at the end of the performance.\r\"Rehab\" was one of four songs pulled from the Pilot episode to appear on the \"Glee: Volume 1\" album.  Although it appeared on the Billboard charts for two weeks, it never cracked #93.  The original song peaked at #9 on the Top 100.  The cast of Vocal Adrenaline performs the number. \n"}, {"text": "Ending the Pilot episode, which song from the show was the first to appear on the Billboard charts?", "correct": "Don't Stop Believin'", "options": ["I Want to Hold Your Hand", "We Will Rock You", "Leavin' On a Jet Plane"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDon't Stop Believin'.\n\n\tThe first episode of the show culminates with the first six members of the Glee Club, New Directions, on stage singing the Journey rock ballad, \"Don't Stop Believing\".  Released after the Pilot's original airdate in May 2009, \"Don't Stop Believing\" reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming one of the show's most successful musical numbers.  The song charted in four different countries and features Finn and Rachel on lead vocals with Tina, Kurt, and Mercedes doing back-up vocals and Artie on guitar.\rJourney's rendition of \"Don't Stop Believin'\", ironically, only reached #9 on the same Billboard chart.  it has since become one of the most popular rock songs of the 1980s. \n"}, {"text": "When Glee Club says that they need more modern musical choices than Chic's \"Le Freak\" in the second episode of the show, \"Showmance\", what song does Mr. Schuester allow them to sing?", "correct": "\"Gold Digger\" by Kanye West", "options": ["\"Makes Me Wonder\" by Maroon 5", "\"Holiday\" by Green Day", "\"So What\" by Pink"], "explanation": "\n\n\n\"Gold Digger\" by Kanye West.\n\n\tA much more modern alternative to the disco 1978 hit, \"Le Freak\", \"Gold Digger\", by Kanye West, is the first song of the season to feature Mr. Schuester on vocals (outside the Director's Cut of the Pilot episode in which he sings \"Leavin' On a Jet Plane\").  The kids are thrilled to sing the song, but are still miffed by the idea that Will still wants them to sing the disco song at the school's pep assembly the following week.  Instead, the group sings the vocals of \"Gold Digger\" and Mr. Schuester takes the lead for Finn, who claims he's still learning to walk and sing at the same time.  This is the first rap song on the show...and not the last to be performed by Mr. Schuester.\rAlthough \"Gold Digger\" appeared as a single on \"Glee: Volume 1\" it failed to chart in North America. \n"}, {"text": "Opting not to perform a disco hit in front of the school in \"Showmance\", New Directions performs \"Push It\" during an assembly.  Who originally released the song?", "correct": "Salt-N-Pepa", "options": ["Ace of Base", "Sir Mix-A-Lot", "TLC"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSalt-N-Pepa.\n\n\tReleased in 1987, \"Push It\" showed up on three US charts peaking at #1 on the US Rap Chart.  Although not their biggest hit, \"Push It\" proved very popular with audiences.  Rachel offers this song up to the Glee Club over Mr. Schuester's decision to play Chic's \"Le Freak\" in front of the school.  The result is hilarious.  The six members of New Directions go out of their way behind Mr. Schuester's back to perform an overly-sexual rendition of the hit song in front of the entire school.  Luckily, the audience loves it, and while Will is disappointed and Sue Sylvester says it's a bigger travesty than an elementary school performance of \"Hair\" she once saw, Principal Figgins is glad they could motivate the kids and offers them a budget for costumes...pulled straight from the Cheerios' dry cleaning budget.\r\"Push It\" was released as a single but never charted in North America nor did it appear on \"Glee: Volume 1\". \n"}, {"text": "\"I Say a Little Prayer\" is not performed by which of these characters in \"Showmance\"?", "correct": "Mercedes", "options": ["Brittany", "Quinn", "Santana"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMercedes.\n\n\tIn order to hop into the Glee Club to both spy for Sue Sylvester and ensure that Finn and Rachel don't hook up, Quinn enlists the help of two other Cheerios, Santana and Brittany, to perform \"I Say a Little Prayer\", one of the songs allowed by Figgins after the \"Push It\" stunt during the assembly.  This is the first song in which all three of them appear and they're let onto the team as a result.\r\"I Say a Little Prayer\" appeared as a bonus song on \"Glee: Volume 1\" though it was never released as a single.  Originally performed by Dionne Warwick, the song reached #4 on the Billboard charts (the Top 100) and became one of her biggest hits. \n"}, {"text": "In the end of \"Showmance\", Rachel sings which song originally by Rihanna?", "correct": "Take a Bow", "options": ["Umbrella", "Hate That I Love You", "Rehab"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTake a Bow.\n\n\tReaching #1 on two different Billboard charts, #2 on another, and appearing on yet another three, \"Take a Bow\" was one of Rihanna's big singles from the \"Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded\" album (her third).  It reached #1 in five countries.  The \"Glee\" version, sung mainly by Rachel but featuring back-up vocals from Tina and Mercedes, reached #46 on the Billboard Charts when released as a single.\rRachel sings the song upon learning that Quinn is taking her solo from Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" before sectionals.  After spending the episode trying to get Finn's attention, she realizes that she needs to step back from the spotlight and let others have a turn despite the fact that she wants to be famous. \n"}]}
