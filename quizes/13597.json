O'Keeffe was, of course, his wife.\r This record was later overtaken.

Plans are underway for a Buddha statue with a height of 152 m in Uttar Pradesh, India. \n"}, {"text": "What was odd about the Matisse painting 'Le Bateau' that was hanging in the New York MOMA in 1961?", "correct": "Hung upside down", "options": ["It was made from tomato paste.", "It was a forgery", "Someone drew a smiley face on it."], "explanation": "\n\n\nHung upside down.\n\n\tIt hung upside-down for about 2 months before someone finally noticed.

Where Do We Go?' in the 1890s?", "correct": "Gauguin", "options": ["Picasso", "Sickert", "Munch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGauguin.\n\n\tThis was one of many paintings executed in the South Pacific by the French master Paul Gauguin.
