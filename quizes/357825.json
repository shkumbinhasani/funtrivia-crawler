{"id": "357825", "name": "Let's Build.... A Plastic Model Kit! Quiz  | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "For Children Trivia", " Topics for Kids", "Games and Toys for Kids"], "questions": [{"text": "When you go to the shop to buy your model, what is important to think about?", "correct": "You should not buy a kit that is too complicated for you", "options": ["That the best kits are always cost the most", "You should buy the biggest kit you can", "Military vehicles are the best"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou should not buy a kit that is too complicated for you.\n\n\tMany kits have a skill level printed clearly on the box.  Lower numbers mean that the kit is suitable for someone just starting modelling.  If you attempt something too complex you may get frustrated and lose interest altogether. \n"}, {"text": "When you chose your model kit in the hobby shop, you noticed that all the boxes had pairs of numbers on them; 1:72, 1:48 and 1:350.  What do these numbers mean?", "correct": "Scale of the kit", "options": ["The number of parts the kit contains", "It's the age range that the kit is suitable for", "D'oh!... You were looking at the price tag!"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScale of the kit.\n\n\tThe 'scale' of the kit is the size ratio between the subject and the model itself.  Many model airplanes are in 1:72 scale which means the the model is seventy-two times smaller than the actual airplane in real life.  For someone starting out as a modeller, 1:72 is a good scale to choose. \n"}, {"text": "What is the most important part of your kit? It will have drawings and numbers printed on it that might confuse you.", "correct": "The instruction sheet", "options": ["A history leaflet about the subject of your kit", "A model catalogue", "A money-off voucher for your next purchase"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe instruction sheet.\n\n\tThe instructions are often very easy to follow.  A few minutes studying them and learning what the symbols mean before starting to build your kit is time well spent.  You can sometimes find small catalogues in the box showing you the other model kits that you can buy.  Money-off vouchers are very rare though! \n"}, {"text": "Where is the best place to build your kit?", "correct": "On a stable surface in a well lit, well ventilated room", "options": ["In the garden", "Late at night in the dark when its quiet", "In the cupboard under the stairs"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOn a stable surface in a well lit, well ventilated room.\n\n\tIt is always a good idea to use a large table near a window as you will need good light while you are building.  If you are using your mum's best dining table you must put something down to protect the surface from knife marks, glue and paint.  If you don't you will probably find yourself in trouble. \n"}, {"text": "What must you remember about craft knives?", "correct": "All of these are important to remember", "options": ["That their use needs your total concentration", "They are NOT toys to be played with", "They are very, very sharp"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these are important to remember.\n\n\tYou will need a knife to cut the parts from the 'sprue' which is the framework that the parts are attached to.  Special craft knives are very, very sharp and must always be treated with caution.  If you are worried about using your craft knife, always ask an adult to help you.  If your mum and dad are worried about you having a knife, an ideal alternative is a pair of nail clippers! \n"}, {"text": "After a craft knife, what is the next most useful tool for building models?", "correct": "A pair of tweezers", "options": ["An electric drill", "A hammer", "A pair of tweezers ", "A teaspoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA pair of tweezers.\n\n\tA pair of tweezers are always useful to have around.  You may drop a small piece on the floor that you might not be able to pick up easily, you can use your tweezers to hold small parts while you are painting them and they can also be used to hold delicate parts that might be damaged by handling with your fingers too often. \n"}, {"text": "If, after a while, you start to feel a little bit sick and light headed, what would be the best thing to do?", "correct": "Check you have put the cap on your tube of glue", "options": ["Finish off that sandwich that mum made for you", "Sniff your glue or paints to see if this is the cause", "Just ignore it and carry on"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCheck you have put the cap on your tube of glue.\n\n\tSome of the glues that plastic modellers use can give off very powerful fumes that might make you feel ill very quickly.  If this happens, open a window or go outside, get some fresh air and stay away until you feel better. \n"}, {"text": "If you've followed the instructions properly, you should have a model to be proud of.  What should you do next that would make your model look even better?", "correct": "Paint it!", "options": ["Play with it with your friends", "Put it on display straight away", "Throw away any unused parts"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPaint it!.\n\n\tOn the instruction sheet that came with your kit you will also have information about painting.  You can follow these instructions or you can let your imagination run wild... When I was about 9 years old I had a bright blue and yellow model of a Lancaster bomber!  \r Some modelling paints also contain solvents and, like the glue that you've used, these will give off fumes that might make you feel a little nauseous if your work area doesn't have good ventilation.  A good idea is to use water based acrylic paints if you can. \n"}, {"text": "The colourful sheet inside the box will add the finishing touch to your model. They are known as 'logos'.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tThey are known as 'decals' (pronounced dee-cals) or, if you live in the UK, 'transfers', or 'stickers' in Australia.  You will need to cut them out and briefly soak them in warm water before sliding them onto your model and allowing them to dry.  Position your 'decals' using a soft, fine-tip paintbrush and do not handle your kit until they are dry. \n"}, {"text": "Your model looks great!  You should put it on display for your friends to see.  What do modellers call these special displays?", "correct": "A Diorama", "options": ["Showing-off", "Storyboards", "Portrait"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA Diorama.\n\n\tWhatever you have chosen as your model, it will look great if you put it in a display!  Unless you are a natural and talented modeller, it might be some time before your skills are up to building a diorama.  But practice does make perfect and with concentration it should not be long before your models are the envy of your friends! \n"}]}
