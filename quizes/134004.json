Which of these seas is not found along the coast of this high-heeled peninsula?", "correct": "Aegean Sea", "options": ["Adriatic Sea", "Tyrrhenian Sea", "Ionian Sea"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAegean Sea.\n\n\tThe coast of Italy is formed by the Adriatic Sea on the east and by the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west.  To the south lies the Ionian Sea.  These seas are all arms of the Mediterranean Sea.  Between the heel and the toe of the Italian Peninsula lies the Gulf of Taranto, while to the north of the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west coast can be found the Ligurian Sea, another arm of the Mediterranean that borders on Italy.  I have heard that one might find some excellent seafood in restaurants of that fine country... \n"}, {"text": "The world's largest peninsula, at 1,250,000 square miles, can be found in which continent?", "correct": "Asia", "options": ["Africa", "South America", "Europe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAsia.\n\n\tAs you might have guessed, the world's largest peninsula is the Arabian Peninsula.

All told, the Alaskan Peninsula is about 570,000 sq. miles in size, making it not only the largest peninsula in the United States but also the Western Hemisphere. \n"}, {"text": "Ox Bel Ha, the world's largest underwater cave system, is located at which peninsula, also famous for the wonderful scuba diving off its coast?", "correct": "Yucatan & Yucat\u00e1n & Yucatan Peninsula & Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nYucatan & Yucat\u00e1n & Yucatan Peninsula & Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\n\tThe Ox Bel Ha cave system is so large, it has yet to be entirely explored.
