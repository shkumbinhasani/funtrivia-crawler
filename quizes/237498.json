Although they have the power of the Sk\u00f6ldpadda (Can-Tah to \"Desperation\" readers), Callahan is unable to fight off the vampires that he once destroyed and he kills himself with Jake's Ruger as he and Oy escape through the kitchen.\rMeanwhile, Susannah and Mia have given birth to the son of Roland and the Crimson King, Mordred, and he kills Mia in order to grow.  Susannah takes the opportunity to fight back and she kills everybody in the room (including Sayre).  When she shoots at Mordred, she accidentally misses and clips off a single leg of the spider-like creature.  She also shoots out Nigel the robot's eyes fearing that he may be siding with the vampires and low men, but it turns out he wasn't.  Regardless, Nigel carries Mia to the final door linking Fedic to 1999 New York where she waits for the remaining members of the ka-tet. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the property where Roland and Eddie are able to travel to 1999 New York City?", "correct": "Cara Laughs", "options": ["The Emerald City", "Salem's Lot", "Bryn Sturgis"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCara Laughs.\n\n\tAfter discovering a Slow Mutant in Maine, Eddie and Roland meet with John Cullum one last time on Turtleback Lane and he decides to help the two form the Tet Corporation and save the rose in New York City.  To do this he has to talk to Odetta Holmes' parents to assure them that she is not dead, and that they need the money for the company.  After their meeting, Roland and Eddie head to 19 Turtleback Lane (Cara Laughs) and they head through what seems like another doorway. \n"}, {"text": "Which is not one of the three characters who bring the ka-tet to Can-Steek-Tete?", "correct": "Walter", "options": ["Ted", "Stanley", "Dinky"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWalter.\n\n\tAfter the ka-tet reunites in Fedic, they take a breather in Nigel the robot's room as he begins to shut down.  Meanwhile, Mordred watches them from a surveillance room and Walter O'Dim makes his somewhat final appearance in the \"Dark Tower\" series.  Although Walter has come to kill Roland, Mordred is too strong and he is killed by the young demon.\rAfter waking up, the ka-tet walks through Fedic and comes across three men who take them to a room.  Here, they all transport to Can-Steek-Tete more than six miles away and they introduce themselves as Ted, Stanley, and Dinky (who appeared in \"Everything's Eventual\").  After briefing them on the beam situation, Roland reveals that Stanley is actually Sheemie, who he met in the past (as shown in \"Wizard and Glass\"). \n"}, {"text": "What odd thing happens to Ted Brautigan when he uses his powers?", "correct": "His pupils dilate", "options": ["His hair turns white", "His ears wiggle", "His skin turns hard"], "explanation": "\n\n\nHis pupils dilate.\n\n\tAfter the ka-tet meets with the three Breakers from Algul Siento, they rest in preparation for their battle against the evil Breakers, can-tah, and taheen of the land covered by the artificial sun.  On recorded films, Ted Brautigan tells his stories about his past and how he was chosen to be a Breaker.  At this point we also learn about a couple of the characters who run the area, Pimli Prentiss and Finli the taheen. \n"}, {"text": "Who is responsible for firing the last shot at Eddie?", "correct": "Pimli Prentiss", "options": ["Sheemie Ruiz", "Ted Brautigan", "Mordred"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPimli Prentiss.\n\n\tAfter a few nights, the ka-tet invades the Algul and the three Breakers manage to save the other Breakers using their mind powers.  The ka-tet manages to kill all of the can-tah and low men, but Pimli Prentiss manages to shoot Eddie in the eye before he's killed.  Though Eddie is doomed and the ka-tet is destined to break apart, he manages to speak for a bit before he leaves to 'the clearing'.  While Susannah decides to stay with Eddie in Algul Siento to bury him, Roland, Jake, and Oy decide that they must return to 1999 before time's up so that they can prevent Stephen King from getting hit by a car. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the man who nearly kills Stephen King?", "correct": "Bryan Smith", "options": ["Moses Carver", "Raymond Hammond", "Ed Deepneau"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBryan Smith.\n\n\tIn Maine of 1999, Roland, Jake, and Oy find the convenience store where many years earlier, Roland and Eddie were ambushed by Enrico Balazar's men.  In the Path of the Beam they found Irene Tassenbaum who agreed to take them to Lovell to 19 Turtleback Lane (the writer's new home).  Unfortunately, they find that King is on one of his many walks. They arrive at the scene to find King walking down the road with Bryan Smith driving the car on the shoulder of the road.  Roland attempts to jump out to save King, but a painful twinge to his side (ka?) stops him and Jake sacrifices himself to save Stephen King. While Roland hypnotizes the writer, Jake dies with Irene and Oy by his side and Roland buries him nearby.  Although the writer is saved and Roland's quest goes on, he has once again lost his son- this time in the world where time only goes in one direction. \n"}, {"text": "What is not a gift given to Roland at the Tet Corporation Headquarters?", "correct": "A gun", "options": ["A cross", "A book", "A watch"], "explanation": "\n\n\nA gun.\n\n\tAfter placing Jake into his grave, Oy and Roland head to New York City with Irene Tassenbaum.  Their first stop there is 2 Hammerskjold Plaza, the home of the rose.  Here, Roland is taken to the home of the Tet Corporation on the 99th floor by Aaron Deepneau's niece, Nancy.  Finally, Roland gets the chance to meet the final man responsible for bringing the corporation to life, Moses Carver (Odetta's godfather).  At 100 years old, he is the last man remaining in the Ka-Tet of the Rose. At a short meeting, Roland is given a gold watch (which may turn backwards as Roland nears the tower).  He is also given a copy of Stephen King's novel \"Insomnia\", which they feel has major significance to Roland's journey (with the antagonist being named Ed Deepneau).  The final object is Aunt Talitha's cross which was given to John Cullum following the meeting on Turtleback Lane. When John passed away, he gave the cross (which he felt was on loan) to Moses Carver to return to Roland when the time came.  After the meeting, Roland gave the novel to Irene feeling that it would be of little use to him.  He bid her farewell and once again entered the Dixie Pig with Oy.  In Fedic he reunited with Susannah. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these was not one of the people waiting for Susannah, Oy, and Roland at Le Casse Roi Russe?", "correct": "Famelo", "options": ["Feemalo", "Fimelo", "Fumelo"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFamelo.\n\n\tThe three leave Fedic following Roland and Oy's return to the world of the tower and they attempt to navigate the passages beneath Thunderclap.  Here they are nearly attacked by a large monster dwelling in the darkness but they escape and begin the last steps of their trek to the tower.  Along the way they finally arrive at Le Casse Roi Russe on the edge of the White Lands of Empathica and they kill Feemalo and Fumalo (who tempt them with deadly items projected to look like food and warm clothing).  They leave Fimelo for Mordred as they leave. After a month of wandering along the Path of the Beam, they manage to get more food, fire, and clothing before finding a small cabin. \n"}, {"text": "What is Joe Collins' real name?", "correct": "Dandelo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDandelo.\n\n\tAt the small cabin on Odd Lane, Roland and Susannah find shelter with a man named Joe Collins who claims that he also lived in the United States at one point.  After a great dinner, he treats them to his stand-up comedy routine and Susannah accidentally bursts her sore on her face.  When she goes to the bathroom she finds a note (from Stephen King) and she realizes that Odd Lane is an anagram of 'Dandelo', who Eddie and Jake warned her of.  When she returns to the living room, Dandelo/Joe Collins reveals himself to be a vampire and begins to choke Roland to death. Susannah saves him by killing the creature with her gun. They find a man in the basement after this, and it turns out to be Patrick Danville.  Patrick has no tongue (it was taken out by Dandelo) and he has a talent for drawing.  The group sets out with a local robot to the edge of the White Lands of Empathica, and they proceed on the final wheels of their journey. \n"}, {"text": "Does Roland ever make it to the top of the Dark Tower?", "correct": "Yes", "options": ["y", "n"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYes.\n\n\tAfter leaving Empathica, the group travels for three nights before Susannah realizes that Patrick has a special power.  Whatever he draws can come to life.  First she manages to have him erase the sore on her face.  When she realizes what this could mean, she has him draw a door (like the one on the beach).  With this, she decides to head home to New York.\rThe following night, Patrick and Roland both fall asleep and Mordred takes the opportunity to attack his father.  If not for Oy, Roland would have died.  Oy fought the creature before Roland had a chance to shoot Mordred into the fire.  After the fierce battle, Oy passed away.  Patrick and Roland continued alone.\rAt the Scarlet Fields of Can'-Ka No Rey, Roland and Patrick finally arrived at the tower, but upon reaching the field, they were immediately attacked by the Crimson King's sneetches.  After hiding behind a stone pyramid for hours, Roland had Patrick draw the Crimson King, then erase him.  This allowed Roland access to the doors of the tower.  After Roland shouted the names of those that he loved and lost on the journey, he entered the tower and Patrick headed back to Federal.  It is unknown what happened to him.\r This story has two endings.  One is Susannah's, and the other is Roland's.  I'll begin with the former, and you can decide if you want to read both.\r Susannah rolled through the door and into Central Park in 1987.  It's snowing, and she realizes that her (Roland's) gun will no longer work, and she's forced to part with it by dropping it into the trash.  She sees Eddie in front of her, and although he really doesn't know her, he's been dreaming of her.  Jake is there as well, and he's also been hearing voices regarding her.  Although they're not in the Keystone World, the three live happily together in what may possibly be the best ending that ka could have given them.\r And then there was one.  Roland entered the dark tower and climbed each stairway to the floors that recounted his past.  At the penultimate floor was the drawing of the Crimson King's red eyes and he made his way to the final door on his quest.  One marked 'ROLAND'.  When he opened the door he saw what it had come to- himself back in the desert, back where our story began.  This time, he falls into the desert (which he may have done many times before, and which he may do many times following).  This time he has the Horn of Eld on his belt.  It's up to the reader to decide if it will help him this time around as he relives his journey to the dark tower.  \r \"The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.\" \n"}]}
