{"id": "348062", "name": "Hard Steal and Deal Quiz / Test | Entertainment by Themes | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Entertainment Trivia", "Entertainment by Themes", "Thematic People in Entertainment"], "questions": [{"text": "Let's talk about Robin Hood, surely one of the most beloved thieves of all time. (He had good branding, too: you usually see him described as an outlaw.) Which of the following twentieth-century actors NEVER portrayed the archer in green on the silver screen?", "correct": "Clark Gable", "options": ["Errol Flynn", "Kevin Costner", "Cary Elwes"], "explanation": "\n\n\nClark Gable.\n\n\tClark Gable played his share of dashing romantic leads, like Rhett Butler in \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), but never got to Sherwood Forest. Errol Flynn played the English folk hero in 1938's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\" which set the template for pop-culture Robin Hoods for decades. Kevin Costner's version of the legend, in 1991's \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\" added copious grit -- and was soon lampooned in the Mel Brooks comedy \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\" In that 1993 film, Cary Elwes' Robin explained why Prince John should fear him: \"\"Because, unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with a English accent.\" Other characters responded with an impressed \"Ooh.\" \n"}, {"text": "A pair of small-time marijuana dealers, Jay and Silent Bob, were first introduced to the moviegoing public in 1994's \"Clerks.\" From the sidewalk in front of a convenience store, they moved on to bigger and better things -- traveling to Hollywood, saving God, and even dispensing romantic advice. In what director's oeuvre are they recurring characters?", "correct": "Kevin Smith", "options": ["Clint Eastwood", "Spike Lee", "George Lucas"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKevin Smith.\n\n\tKevin Smith's View Askewniverse films, comedies whose heroes could usually be classified as \"losers,\" gained a devoted following for their witty dialogue and oddly charming, misfit characters. The loquacious but uneducated Jay (Jason Mewes) and taciturn but insightful Silent Bob (Smith) were soon fan favorites. Silent Bob gave surprisingly good advice in \"Clerks\" and in \"Chasing Amy\" (1997). The pair intervened, reluctantly, on the side of good in \"Dogma\" (1999), and they got their own road-trip movie in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001). \n"}, {"text": "\"Ocean's Eleven\" is a classic heist movie, whether it's the 1960 original or the 2001 remake. In each, Danny Ocean assembles a crack team of crooks, each with his own specialty, to make a big score against a heavily defended target. What type of institution do both elevens set out to rob?", "correct": "Casino", "options": ["Bank", "Military base", "Art museum"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCasino.\n\n\tLas Vegas casinos keep a lot of money on hand; as the movies explain, what if all the gamblers want to cash out? The vaults, though, are closely guarded, and it's a joy to watch the thieves peel back the layers of security. The details of the schemes differ in the two movies, although both rely on a great deal of planning, a great deal of luck, and well-timed electrical outages. Frank Sinatra, backed by the Rat Pack, played Danny Ocean in the original; George Clooney was the fearless leader in the remake. \n"}, {"text": "Lovable rogues are a fixture of country songs, and sometimes this includes thieves. Consider the case of an auto worker who stole the fittings for a Cadillac \"One Piece at a Time.\" As he later tells a curious truck driver, \"You could say I went down to the factory and picked it up - it's cheaper that way.\" What singer took this song to the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1976?", "correct": "Johnny Cash", "options": ["Patsy Cline", "Willie Nelson", "Hank Williams"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohnny Cash.\n\n\t\"One Piece at a Time,\" written by Wayne Kemp, is a real trip. Our protagonist is an assembly-line worker at a Cadillac plant, and is disappointed to realize that he'll never be able to buy a Cadillac the honest way himself. So he hits on the idea of smuggling the car parts out, one at a time, so that he can assemble them himself into a fancy automobile. Bit by bit, in his lunchbox and in his buddy's mobile home, he steals the parts, large and small - but hilarity ensues when he tries to put them all together. It turns out that there really is a difference between model years! \n"}, {"text": "Drug dealing makes for some interesting character arcs. One television series, launched on AMC in 2008, follows a man who starts out very sympathetic: he's a high-school chemistry teacher with a young family, who's just been told that he's dying of cancer. He's worried about his family's financial security - so he starts making and dealing meth. What show follows his descent into crime?", "correct": "Breaking Bad", "options": ["Angel", "The Sopranos", "Dexter"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBreaking Bad.\n\n\tWalter White (Bryan Cranston) begins as a sympathetic character, but over the course of the series, as he works himself deeper and deeper into drug dealing, he becomes darker and darker; soon he is less a hero than an anti-hero. The series has received multiple awards for its gritty yet morally engaged depiction of life, love, choices and consequences. \n"}, {"text": "Nancy Botwin, protagonist of the Showtime comedy series \"Weeds,\" is another respectable TV citizen who turns to drug dealing in order to support her family. What prompts her to take this step?", "correct": "The sudden death of her husband", "options": ["The loss of her job", "Her child's expensive chronic illness", "A threatened foreclosure on her home"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe sudden death of her husband.\n\n\t\"Weeds\" launched in 2005 with the tagline, \"A Comedy Series about Dealing in the Suburbs.\" Much of the show's appeal lies in the contrast between the Botwin family's upstanding appearance and their increasingly illegal activities, set into motion by the tragic death of the family breadwinner from a heart attack. As in \"Breaking Bad,\" the leading character (Mary-Louise Parker) ends up dragging her family (in this case, her two sons) with her in her descent into the drug trade. \n"}, {"text": "Can theft be educational? Br\u00f8derbund Software thought it could be, and set about trying to teach kids geography by setting them in pursuit of an extremely ambitious thief. Who is this globe-trotting criminal mastermind, who launched a number of video games and a children's television series?", "correct": "Carmen Sandiego", "options": ["Al Capone", "Thomas Crown", "Selina Kyle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCarmen Sandiego.\n\n\tAs the game or show opens, Carmen (or one of her henchmen) has stolen a treasure - which could be as portable as a gargoyle from Notre Dame or as unwieldy as the Cape of Good Hope - and players must follow geographical clues to answer the title question: \"Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?\". The punny adventures began in 1985 and continued apace: a historical version (\"Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?\") was released in 1989, and the children's game show began its four-year run in 1991. I can still sing the chorus of the theme song. \n"}, {"text": "A controversial video-game series, launched in 1997 by DMA Design and Tarantula Studios, asked players to help their characters rise through the ranks of a criminal organization. The title of the series is what designation for a particular type of theft?", "correct": "Grand Theft Auto", "options": ["Petty Larceny", "Embezzlement", "Breaking and Entering"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto.\n\n\t\"Grand theft auto\" refers to the theft of a car - the \"grand\" refers to the monetary value of the stolen goods. In the actual gameplay, car theft is only one way a player can advance: there are also banks to rob, people to assassinate, and general mayhem to advance. These were early and influential examples of open-world game design, in which the player has wide freedom to explore the virtual world and can make substantive choices about what to do in-game. It's quite different from games like, say, \"Super Mario Bros.,\" in which the different settings can only be seen in a particular order. \r The first \"Grand Theft Auto\" was released for multiple platforms: Nintendo's Game Boy, Sony's PlayStation, and both DOS and Microsoft Windows for personal computers. \n"}, {"text": "Terry Pratchett's series of \"Discworld\" books has thrilled fantasy fans for years, but even the Discworld has its problems. Sergeant Detritus, of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, is particularly concerned with the effects of a drug called Slab. To what population is Slab marketed?", "correct": "Trolls", "options": ["Dwarves", "Zombies", "Vampires"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrolls.\n\n\tAll of these groups live in Ankh-Morpork, but only trolls are sensitive to the effects of Slab. Sergeant Detritus, a troll himself, described the drug in \"Feet of Clay\" (1996): \"It are chloric ammonium an' radium mixed up. It give your head a tingle but melts troll brains.\" Never fear, however: the good sergeant has matters well in hand. In the same book, he shows off the public awareness poster he's done up: \"Slab: Just say `AarrghaarghpleeassennononoUGH.'\"\r The \"Discworld\" novels take place on a flat, vaguely early-Industrial-Revolution-era world that is carried through space on the backs of four elephants, who themselves ride on the back of a giant space turtle. Through this unlikely lens, Pratchett explores the foibles of human society with razor wit. \n"}, {"text": "Over five seasons, the television show \"The Wire\" followed the ins and outs of a city's trade in illegal drugs, from importation to distribution, plus the systemic rot in the institutions that are supposed to quash it. In Season 1, which of these characters runs the criminal organization that deals out drugs and death from the Franklin Terrace Towers?", "correct": "Avon Barksdale", "options": ["Lester Freamon", "Jimmy McNulty", "Omar Little"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAvon Barksdale.\n\n\tAt the beginning of the show, the Barksdale Organization has control of some prime real estate for drug dealing, and they guard their assets ruthlessly and brutally. The show's first season centers on the initial efforts of the city police to bring the organization down; subsequent seasons focus on different aspects of corruption and the drug trade, always keeping one eye on the Barksdales. \r Lester Freamon and Jimmy McNulty are police assigned to the major-case unit. Omar Little is a stick-up man whose feud with the Barksdales fueled many a plot point. \n"}]}
