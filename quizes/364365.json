{"id": "364365", "name": "Yeeeeaaahhhh It's The Muppets Quiz | Television | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "TV Trivia", "Television L-P", "Muppets"], "questions": [{"text": "Who plays the drums for Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem?", "correct": "Animal", "options": ["Janice", "Zoot", "Lips"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAnimal.\n\n\tCreated by Michael K. Frith and built by Dave Goelz, Animal was portrayed by Frank Oz from his first appearance on \"The Muppet Show\" until 2000. Frank Oz summed up Animal's character: \"sex, sleep, food, drums and pain\". Due to the often violent nature of his performances, Animal is usually chained to his drum kit during performances by The Mayhems.\rOf the alternatives, Zoot plays the saxophone, Janice the guitar and Lips the trumpet. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's long-suffering assistant?", "correct": "Beaker", "options": ["Test Tube", "Flask", "Funnel"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBeaker.\n\n\tCreated by Jim Henson and voiced by Richard Hunt, Beaker is a magnet for disaster. Honeydew's experiments usually lead to trouble for Beaker -- he gets eaten by monsters, electrocuted, blown up and frequently lost various body parts. Beaker's appearance is best described as disheveled: bulging eyes, a shock of untidy red hair and a drawbridge mouth. \n"}, {"text": "What is the first name of Doctor Strangepork, the chief science officer in the \"Pigs in Space\" sketches?", "correct": "Julius", "options": ["Stephen", "Jason", "Frederick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJulius.\n\n\tCreated by Jim Henson and portrayed by Jerry Nelson, Doctor Julius Strangpork is the the science officer aboard the USS Swinetrek. Other crew members who appear in the regular \"Pigs in Space\" segment are first mate Miss Piggy and Captain Link Hogthrob, gorgeous (to a pig) but stupid. \n"}, {"text": "Which character has a long-standing romantic relationship with The Great Gonzo, the Muppet Theater's stuntman?", "correct": "Camilla the Chicken", "options": ["Rizzo the Rat", "Ohreally Bird", "Gladys the Cafeteria Lady"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCamilla the Chicken.\n\n\tCreated and performed by Dave Goelz, The Great Gonzo began life as one of The Frackles, but quickly developed into a major character. With his blue fur, purple hair (feathers), hooked nose and bug eyes, Gonzo is one of the few Muppets that is neither human nor a recognizable animal species. Indeed, the question of precisely what species Gonzo is part of is a long-running gag on the show. Rizzo the Rat is Gonzo's best friend and roommate. \rThe show's acknowledged expert on chickens, Gonzo has an ongoing romantic relationship with Camilla the Chicken (performed by Jerry Nelson) although, unfortunately, as all chickens look alike even to Gonzo, even he can never be sure which one is Camilla. \n"}, {"text": "Which Muppet, usually seen carrying a plunger box, loves to blow things up?", "correct": "Crazy Harry", "options": ["Norman the Nutter", "Demolition Dan", "Billy the Bang"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCrazy Harry.\n\n\tCreated by Jim Henson and primarily voiced and operated by Jerry Nelson, Crazy Harry is fixated by explosions. Harry has egg-shaped eyes, unruly black hair and a scruffy beard, but his main hallmark is a distinctive cackling laugh that always follows something going up in smoke. Harry's appearances is a running gag in the early series of \"The Muppet Show\". \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of Miss Piggy's pet poodle?", "correct": "Foo-Foo", "options": ["Lulu", "Fang", "Kermie"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFoo-Foo.\n\n\tFoo-Foo is one of the few Muppet animals that do not speak. She was created by Jim Henson, with Steve Whitmire providing her high-pitched yaps. Although there is a Foo-Foo puppet, she is also played by a real-life white poodle in some shots. \n"}, {"text": "What is the name of the blue \"whatnot\", usually seen wearing a frilly, multi-colored shirt, who shows up during musical numbers playing an instrument called a \"muppephone\"?", "correct": "Marvin", "options": ["Vogon", "Arthur", "Ford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMarvin.\n\n\tMarvin Suggs was portrayed by Frank Oz. Jim Henson and Jerry Nelson provided the 'voices' (a series of 'ow' with different tones) of the small, round pink and orange Muppets that make up the muppephone. The noise occurs when Marvin hits them on the head with a mallet. Each of the individual Muppets makes a slightly different sound, creating the effect of a sadist's keyboard instrument. \n"}, {"text": "Who is the resident pianist at the Muppet Theater?", "correct": "Rowlf the Dog", "options": ["Rizzo the Rat", "Lenny the Lizard", "Gorgon Heap"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRowlf the Dog.\n\n\tCreated and portrayed by Jim Henson, the scruffy brown dog with the round black nose and floppy ears is actually the original Muppet. Rowlf the Dog dates back to 1963, when he was a recurring character on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\". Rowlf is particularly noted for his deadpan humor. He is also described as \"a master of the double-take\". \n"}, {"text": "Which character is the troupe's backstage gofer (gopher?) as well as the nephew of the Muppet Theatre's owner?", "correct": "Scooter", "options": ["Thog", "Sweetums", "Yorick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nScooter.\n\n\tCreated by Jim Henson and portrayed by Richard Hunt until his death in 1992, Scooter got the gofer's job because his uncle, J. P. Grosse, owns Muppet Theater. Orange with a shock of dark orange hair, Scooter's principal feature is his glasses -- they have frames but the lens are actually his eyes. It has been commented that it is appropriate that he has the job of the show's gofer, since he also looks like a gopher.\rOne of Scooter's jobs as gofer is to go to the dressing room of the week's guest star and announce \"fifteen seconds to curtain\". There usually follows a joke or short sketch before the opening credits roll. \n"}, {"text": "What nationality is the cleaver-juggling chef?", "correct": "Swedish", "options": ["Belgian", "Chinese", "French"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSwedish.\n\n\tCreated by Jim Henson, Henson originally controlled the head and performed the voice of the Swedish Chef, whilst Frank Oz provided the puppet with live hands. All Swedish Chef sketches begin with him busy cooking whilst singing his signature yodel-esque song in his mock Swedish accent. He always wears a toque blanche, although how he sees to cook when his bushy eyebrows completely obscure his eyes is anybody's guess. \n"}]}
