The whammy was a cartoon character which symbolically took someone's money and prizes away.  If someone landed on four whammies, that person lost the game. A short cartoon was shown each time a contestant landed on a whammy.  One cartoon showed the whammy dressed as Boy George singing \"Who would ever hurt a whammy?\" before the whammy was hit by a large hammer. \n"}, {"text": "Which 1980s game show hosted by Bert Convy involved celebrities drawing pictures?", "correct": "Win, Lose, or Draw", "options": ["Tattletales", "Convy Concentration", "Super Password"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWin, Lose, or Draw.\n\n\tBert Convy hosted at least three game shows involving celebrities.

For example, if someone's name was Rock Hudson, each of three celebrities took turns asking questions, such as \"Is he in the movies?\"  The celebrity who guessed the name kept his or her money, but the others who did not guess had to give the contestant a check for $25. \n"}, {"text": "Which game show had a segment in which people spun a small wheel, but later the show used a big wheel?", "correct": "The New Price Is Right", "options": ["Hollywood Squares", "Wheel of Misfortune", "Card Sharks"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe New Price Is Right.\n\n\tThere had been a half hour show beginning in the 1950s called \"The Price Is Right\".  In the 1970s a show began called \"The New Price Is Right\" which, similar to \"Let's Make a Deal\", involved contestants from the audience playing different games to win prizes.  When a special week of hour-long episodes was made, three contestants spun an upright small wheel to land on numbers to try to add up to close to 100 without going over.  When this became a feature in the permanent hour show, a much larger wheel was used, so no one could see what numbers were on the other side. \n"}, {"text": "In \"The Newlywed Game\", what did couples do to get points?", "correct": "Give the same answer to a question", "options": ["Identify someone in a picture", "Throw a pie plate", "Balance an egg on a spoon"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGive the same answer to a question.\n\n\tBeginning in the 1960s, at various times \"The Newlywed Game\" involved couples who were married less than two years.  The men were asked a set of questions, for example, \"What is the color of your wife's eyes?\"  The women were brought out and answered the same questions.  If the husband and wife each gave the same answer, they would win points.  Later, it was the women who went first and then the husbands gave their answers.  The couple with the most points won a prize. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Tattletales\", who won the money at the end of each episode?", "correct": "The audience", "options": ["An alien ", "The celebrities", "The host"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe audience.\n\n\tLike \"The Newlywed Game\" this involved couples who tried to match the same answer.  In this case it was three couples with a husband or wife or both being a celebrity.  Some of the couples were not married, and some had been married several years.  For example, a question might ask, \"If your wife heard someone say something bad about her in a public restroom, would she confront the person or say nothing?\"  Each couple's section got money for each matching answer.  If one section had more money, they got an extra $1000.  If it were a tie, the sections split the thousand dollars. \n"}, {"text": "In \"Celebrity Name Game\", what's the minimum the winning pair of contestants would win?", "correct": "Three thousand dollars", "options": ["Boat", "Airplane", "Car"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThree thousand dollars.\n\n\t\"Celebrity Name Game\" involved two pairs of contestants playing guessing games with two celebrities.

The first pair to make it to $3000 or more played the fourth round to try to win $20,000 if they guessed all ten items. \n"}, {"text": "Nipsey Russell was a regular in which of these game shows?", "correct": "Rhyme and Reason", "options": ["Some Like It Hot", "Rat Race", "Potluck"], "explanation": "\n\n\nRhyme and Reason.\n\n\tNipsey Russell (Sep 15, 1918 - Oct 2, 2005) made appearances on various game shows in the 1970s, including \"Pyramid\" and \"Match Game\".  Someone decided to do a show which was basically the same thing as \"Match Game\" except that the contestant filled in the blank with a rhyming word that completed a rhyming poem.  They won points if celebrities gave the same answer.  Nipsey Russell was famous for making up funny little rhymes that he said on television, so he was the resident regular celebrity of \"Rhyme and Reason\" (July 7, 1975 - July 9, 1976). \n"}, {"text": "Which game show was hosted by Alex Trebek from July 16, 1973 - June 28, 1974?", "correct": "The Wizard of Odds", "options": ["Classic Concentration", "Jeopardy", "High Rollers"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wizard of Odds.\n\n\tAlex Trebek hosted all four game shows at various times, but the Canadian's first American game show was \"The Wizard of Odds\" in which contestants answered statistical questions.

Each of three contestants got a card when he or she gave a correct answer.  The contestant tried to get 21 or close to 21 without going over, or the contestant could pass a card to another contestant, hoping to make that person go over 21 to bust and lose that round.  The last person not busting, or the first person to hit 21 won that round. Each contestant was given 100 points for a correct answer and 500 points for winning the round.  The two contestants with more points played round three.  The winner of round three played the bonus round.  Getting 21 once gave $1000.  Getting 21 twice gave $5000.  Getting 21 three times gave $25,000.  However, if they risked continuing and got over 21, they lost the bonus money. \n"}]}
