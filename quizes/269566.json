Victor Fleming was the director of this film that still, by some measures, is the all-time box-office champion. \n"}, {"text": "Which of these great actresses was not part of the cast of 'The Women', an all-star comedy from 1939?", "correct": "Bette Davis", "options": ["Joan Crawford", "Rosalind Russell", "Norma Shearer"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBette Davis.\n\n\tPaulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine were also part of the great cast of 'The Women', a film directed by George Cukor.

Starring Joel McCrea and Fay Wray (yes, of 'King Kong' fame), this movie is worthy of a viewing! \n"}, {"text": "Where does the Joad family move to find itself a new life in the touching 1940 film 'The Grapes of Wrath', masterfully put together by director John Ford?", "correct": "California", "options": ["New York", "Washington", "Michigan"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCalifornia.\n\n\tFrom the Oklahoma Dust Bowl the Joad family assembles itself for a hair-raising journey across the U.S. in a ramshackle truck.

In what 1953 film does he appear as a tough guy biker?", "correct": "The Wild One", "options": ["The Big Heat", "Rebel Without a Cause", "The Snake Pit"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Wild One.\n\n\t'The Wild One' was a then-controversial movie about two rival biker gangs that terrorize a tiny town in California.  Not only did Brando appear, but Lee Marvin as well.

Which of these was not one of them?", "correct": "Spencer Tracy", "options": ["Clark Gable", "Charles Laughton", "Franchot Tone"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpencer Tracy.\n\n\tMy personal favorite adaptation of the Bounty story, 1935's 'Mutiny on the Bounty' featured a gruff Laughton as Captain Bligh and an un-moustached Clark Gable as the swashbuckling Fletcher Christian.  Tone almost steals the show as the self-sacrificial Byam. \n"}, {"text": "What is the nationality of the character Manuel, played brilliantly by Spencer Tracy in the 1937 film 'Captains Courageous'?", "correct": "Portuguese", "options": ["Italian", "Spanish", "Mexican"], "explanation": "\n\n\nPortuguese.\n\n\tSpencer Tracy is simply stunning as Manuel, a low-key Portuguese fisherman who charges himself with the duty of teaching the young and arrogant Harvey Cheyne some of life's difficult lesson.

Cornel Wilde, Vincent Price and Jeanne Crain also appear, but it is Tierney who steals the show.  It's no wonder that this film procured for Tierney her one and only Oscar nomination.\r Thanks for playing this quiz, I hope you enjoyed it! \n"}]}
