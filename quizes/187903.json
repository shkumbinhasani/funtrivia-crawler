{"id": "187903", "name": "My Favorite Westerns, Part II Quiz | Movie Mixture | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Movie Trivia", "Movie Mixture", "Westerns and Gangster Films"], "questions": [{"text": "Many believe that the best movie-western director of all time was not American, but rather Italian.  Of course, they would be talking about Sergio Leone.  One of Leone's best films was the 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (aka 'Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo').  Which of these actors did not play a starring role in this work of art?", "correct": "Charles Bronson", "options": ["Lee Van Cleef", "Clint Eastwood", "Eli Wallach"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCharles Bronson.\n\n\tTo see Sergio Leone team up with Charles Bronson you must check out 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.  'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' features a continuing game of one-upmanship between 'the good', Clint Eastwood (aka Blondie), 'the bad', Lee Van Cleef (aka Angel Eyes) and 'the ugly' Eli Wallach (aka Tuco).  From beginning to end this film generates excitement, laughs and suspence as it leads up to the final showdown between the three main stars.  I give it a thumbs up. \n"}, {"text": "'Who are those guys?' is a line you will find said several times over in which of these classic films of the western genre?", "correct": "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "options": ["The Searchers", "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", "The Ox-Bow Incident"], "explanation": "\n\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\n\t'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' stars Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as Sundance.  The film features a very sympathetic story about the two western outlaws as they rob trains, seduce women and get chased halfway across the west by a gang of bounty hunters.  The chemistry between the two main actors is undeniably strong, making for a very entertaining watch. \n"}, {"text": "In the 1948 film 'Red River', John Wayne teams up with old standby Walter Brennan and what relatively new Hollywood talent, as three ranchers who push thousands of cattle from their southern Texas land into Kansas?", "correct": "Montgomery Clift", "options": ["Kirk Douglas", "Lloyd Bridges", "Charlton Heston"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMontgomery Clift.\n\n\t'Red River' marked only the second film by the up-and-coming Hollywood star Montgomery Clift.  He plays Matt Garth alongside Wayne's crusty and weather-worn Thomas Dunson, a man who will stop at nothing to reach his goal.  Alongside the two stars is the old reliable Walter Brennan, who plays Wayne's sidekick Groot Nadine.  Howard Hawks directs this dark but exciting western adventure that also features the only co-appearance of longtime film stars Harry Carey and his son Harry Carey, Jr.  Also look for the gorgeous Joanne Dru! \n"}, {"text": "Another John Wayne film, this time the one that made him a big star...'Stagecoach'.  What is the name of the character that Wayne plays in this classic John Ford adventure?", "correct": "The Ringo Kid", "options": ["Sheriff Roy Brown", "Old Laredo", "The Outlaw from Oklahoma"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Ringo Kid.\n\n\tIf you enjoy a good western, 'Stagecoach' might be the film for you.  Made in 1938, this film really made John Wayne a big Hollywood name. Alongside a great cast, which features the likes of George Bancroft, John Carradine, Claire Trevor and Andy Devine, Wayne does some of his very best work as the wandering Ringo Kid.  Also featured for the first time in a John Ford film is the beautiful Monument Valley of southern Utah.  It would make many other appearances in his work. \n"}, {"text": "In a 1969 revisionist piece, which director made good guys out of a bunch of dirty outlaws, led by William Holden and Ernest Borgnine, in 'The Wild Bunch'?", "correct": "Sam Peckinpah", "options": ["Howard Hawks", "Fred Zinnemann", "George Hill"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSam Peckinpah.\n\n\tPeckinpah's wild bunch featured four Oscar winners: William Holden (Stalag 17), Ernest Borgnine (Marty), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show) and Edmond O'Brien (The Barefoot Contessa).  In addition to that, Robert Ryan also appeared as Deke Thornton, a man who relentlessly pursues the wild bunch as they plan their last crime, the robbery of a train.  The film features over 3,600 editorial cuts, possibly the most ever processed in a single feature film. \n"}, {"text": "1953's 'Shane' was one of the classic westerns of all-time.  The title character refers to a young boy in the film.", "correct": "False", "options": ["t", "f"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFalse.\n\n\tPlayed by Alan Ladd, Shane is very much an adult in this film.  A wanderer, he happens upon the Starretts, one of a group of families who is attempting to settle the wild areas around Jackson, Wyoming.  Shane helps the Starretts battle Rufus Ryker, a local bully who attempts to intimidate these 'squatters' into leaving their newly settled farms.  Does he succeed?  Watch the film and find out. \n"}, {"text": "One of the most successful westerns at both the box office and at the Academy Awards ceremonies was 1990's 'Dances with Wolves'.  Which of these Oscars did this majestic film NOT bring home?", "correct": "Best Actor", "options": ["Best Picture", "Best Director", "Best Writing/Screenplay"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBest Actor.\n\n\t'Dances with Wolves' was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including three acting awards, and won seven of them.  None of the actors nominated (Kevin Costner, Graham Greene and Mary McDonnell) won an Oscar.  Costner did take home two Oscars, however, for Best Director and Best Picture.  Michael Blake, who also wrote the novel, won an Oscar for Best Screenplay.\r If you love this film as much as I, why not check out my quizzes on the film?

Sometimes a good comedy emerges from this genre.  Take, for example, 'Blazing Saddles', Mel Brooks' riotous 1974 western spoof.  Which of these actors plays the clever Sheriff Bart in this comic tale?", "correct": "Cleavon Little", "options": ["Gene Wilder", "Richard Pryor", "Slim Pickens"], "explanation": "\n\n\nCleavon Little.\n\n\tRichard Pryor was originally set to play the role of Bart, but Mel Brooks was forced to look elsewhere by the studio due to Pryor's 'controversial' presence.  Pryor played a big role in creating the script for this very funny film.\r Stepping into the Bart role was the very capable Cleavon Little.  His chemistry with Gene Wilder, who played Jim (The Waco Kid), was marvelous.  As most of you know, Wilder would get the chance to do several later films with his good friend Pryor.\r If you loved this film as much as I, why not try my quiz on 'Blazing Saddles' quotes?

What is this Lawrence Kasdan picture called?", "correct": "Silverado", "options": ["Fort Apache", "Tombstone", "El Dorado"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSilverado.\n\n\tAlong with the actors already mentioned, the star-studded 'Silverado' also features performances by Linda Hunt, Jeff Goldblum, Rosanna Arquette and a number of other good character actors.  'Silverado' has enough comedy, plot twists, action and adventure to satisfy any filmgoer, I would think.  Even John Cleese, the Monty Python funnyman, gets involved in the excitement! \n"}, {"text": "Last but not least we have 'The Magnificent Seven', a 1960 film based on one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.  Who directed this American remake of Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai'?", "correct": "John Sturges", "options": ["Martin Ritt", "Anthony Mann", "John Ford"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJohn Sturges.\n\n\tNot quite reaching the lofty level of its Japanese predecessor (one of the top five films of all time, in my opinion), 'The Magnificent Seven' is still an enjoyable piece of work.  Especially entertaining in this film are the acting performances of Yul Brynner and Eli Wallach.  A touch of spice is added by their various co-stars, particularly Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Steven McQueen.  If you haven't seen this one, you ought to make some time for it.  If you have seen this, but haven't seen 'The Seven Samurai', you must see the latter film as soon as possible!\r Thank you for joining me for this tour through the greatest western films, I hope you found a few of your favorites here.
