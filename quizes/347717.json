What was the name of this seminal horror classic set in the forest?", "correct": "The Evil Dead", "options": ["Evil Darkness", "Evil in the Woods", "The Evil From Below"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Evil Dead.\n\n\tAlthough \"The Evil Dead\" was better known at the time for being banned in a number of countries upon its 1981 release, it has since become one of the most famous possession-style movies and one of the most popular cult horror classics of the 1980s.  Starring Bruce Campbell as Ash, the movie followed a group of friends reading from \"The Necronomicon\" on a trip to a cabin in the woods.  Campbell returned for \"The Evil Dead II\" and \"Army of Darkness\" becoming a horror and cult mainstay.\r\"The Evil Dead\" has since premiered as a musical (in Toronto) which has spread around North America.  Sam Raimi returned to horror in 2010 with the well-received \"Drag Me to Hell\". \n"}, {"text": "In 2002, what Chinese horror film directed by the Pang Brothers featured a woman receiving life-changing surgery only to discover that she could see ghosts?", "correct": "The Eye", "options": ["The Experiment", "The Episode", "The End"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Eye.\n\n\tDirected by the Pang Brothers, \"The Eye\" featured a woman who received a cornea transplant granting her the ability to see after years of blindness.  As is the tendency in horror films, things didn't go too well-- she started seeing ghosts in the following days.  \"The Eye\" received a sequel in 2004, \"The Eye 2\", and another, \"The Eye 10\", in 2005.  India remade it in the same year while it became yet another Americanized Asian horror offering in 2008.  Jessica Alba starred in the U.S. version of \"The Eye\" (with the same name) and it went on to earn nearly $60,000,000 in the box office. On the flipside, despite the money, it was critically-panned and Alba was nominated for a Razzie. Certainly something not worth seeing. \n"}, {"text": "In what 1997 sci-fi-driven horror film does a black hole unleash an interstellar evil upon Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill?", "correct": "Event Horizon", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nEvent Horizon.\n\n\tThe first film to slide into the horror genre by Paul W. S. Anderson, the director of \"Resident Evil\", \"Pandorum\", \"Alien Vs. Predator\", and \"Mortal Kombat\", \"Event Horizon\" was released early into his career - 1997.  The movie featured a crew led by Laurence Fishburne as they set out to discover what happened to a large ship known as the Event Horizon.  What they found was a machine designed to tear open a black hole and, possibly, the entrance to Hell.\rThe movie was a box office failure; it ended up earning less than half of its $60,000,000 budget and found critical disappointment. \n"}, {"text": "Barbara Hershey finds herself stalked by an invisible something as a result of psychological trauma in what 1982 horror movie?", "correct": "The Entity", "options": ["The Edge of Darkness", "Everywhere", "Eye of the Beholder"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Entity.\n\n\tBarbara Hershey played the role of Carla, a woman whose daily actions became dangerous as she was haunted by an invisible entity.  During the film she spoke to a psychologist about the issues plaguing her only to discover that it may have been more than just delusions of past traumas coming back to haunt her.\rBarbara Hershey was nominated for an Oscar for \"The Portrait of a Lady\" and won a number of honours at the Cannes Film Festival.  She later appeared in the horror film \"Insidious\" (2011), which featured a plot similar to \"The Entity\", and \"Black Swan\" (2010). \n"}, {"text": "Horror fans were surprised to find that this 2005 horror film also contained elements of a courtroom drama.  Receiving over $140,000,000 in the box office, what movie directed by Scott Derrickson was supposedly based on a true story? ", "correct": "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", "options": ["Eternal Peril", "Eyes of the Devil", "Evil Incarnate"], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose.\n\n\tScott Derrickson had his theatrical directorial debut with this 2005 film which, surprisingly, hit it big with moviegoers to earn ten times more than its budget.  Derrickson also worked on the screenplays for \"Scream 4\", \"The Messengers\", and the sequel to the 1990s slasher \"Urban Legend\", \"Urban Legend: Final Cut\".\r\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" followed a lawyer played by Laura Linney as she attempted to prove the innocence of a priest responsible for the titular exorcism.  Much of the film took place in flashbacks with the remainder being set in the courtroom.  The film also starred Jennifer Carpenter (of TV's \"Dexter\" and \"Quarantine\" fame) as Emily Rose. \n"}, {"text": "The UK contributed to the horror scene in 2008 with what film about a couple's harrowing encounter with brutal teenagers?", "correct": "Eden Lake", "options": ["Elders", "Every Last One", "Evil Within"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEden Lake.\n\n\tBuilding off a fear of uncontrollable youth, \"Eden Lake\" followed a couple seeking relaxation at a beachside campsite only to get involved in a nightmarish battle against unruly teenagers.  The back-and-forth escalated and the couple found themselves fearing for their lives at the hands of these murderous young adults.\r\"Eden Lake\" was well-received in the UK becoming the third UK film to win the Empire Award for Best Horror (of four to that date).  Director James Watkins later filmed \"The Woman in Black\", starring Daniel Radcliffe, in 2012.  \"Eden Lake\" starred Kelly Reilly and Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. \n"}, {"text": "\"La posesi\u00f3n de Emma Evans\" was a 2010 Spanish horror film known to English-speaking audiences by what single-word name?", "correct": "Exorcismus", "options": ["The Evil of Satan", "Exile", "End of Days"], "explanation": "\n\n\nExorcismus.\n\n\t\"Exorcismus\", while shown in limited release at Spain's Sitges Film Festival, never made it big overseas.  In North America, the film was known to many as \"Exorcismus\" (also its Spanish/European release's name) but it ended up releasing on home video under the title \"The Possession of Emma Evans\" to distance itself from other major exorcism films released around the same time.  The film followed the exorcism of a Spanish teenager who believed she was possessed and her family's attempts to save their daughter. \n"}, {"text": "Famous horror director Tobe Hooper released this film about a man and his killer croc in 1977.  What movie featuring Robert Englund was it?", "correct": "Eaten Alive", "options": ["Eerie Marsh", "Evil Crocs from Outer Space", "Evil Swamp Thing"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEaten Alive.\n\n\t\"Eaten Alive\" was not the most tightly-made of horror movies.  It was Hooper's third film (made between \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Salem's Lot\"), and Englund's first horror movie; a few years before he became famous for playing Freddy Krueger.  \"Eaten Alive's\" claim to fame, however, was a man who killed his victims and fed them to a hungry crocodile; this idea would be revisited in the 1999 movie \"Lake Placid\".\r\"Eaten Alive\" was nearly banned in the UK not for its 'unique' premise, but for the inclusion of prostitution in the plot.  Hooper later created another killer croc film, \"Crocodile\", in 2000... one year after \"Lake Placid\" pushed the idea. \n"}, {"text": "What famous 1973 horror film directed by William Friedkin included the characters Regan MacNeil and Father Damien Karras?", "correct": "The Exorcist & Exorcist", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Exorcist & Exorcist.\n\n\tCertainly one of the most acclaimed horror films ever released, \"The Exorcist\" received ten Oscar nods (and two wins) on top of countless additional accolades.  The film was also added to the U.S. National Film Registry.\r\"The Exorcist\" involved a mother and daughter's battle with a demon.  As the daughter, Regan (played by Linda Blair) became a vessel for a Hellish creature, her mother (played by Ellen Burstyn) called in the exorcists.  The film earned over $400,000,000 in the box office becoming a staple in any horror filmgoer's collection.  Several sequels were filmed to capitalize on the original's successes, but none failed to meet the bar set by Friedkin with this film. \n"}, {"text": "Known in France as \"Les Yeux Sans Visage\", what 1960 movie directed by Georges Franju featured a mad doctor's attempts to 'fix' his daughter?", "correct": "Eyes Without a Face", "options": ["End of Days", "Everyday Troubles", "Edge of the Knife"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEyes Without a Face.\n\n\tIn this film, a French scientist tried to find a way to repair his daughter whose face was damaged in an accident many months earlier, resulting in her needing to wear a mask.  To accomplish this, he needed to kidnap women and remove their faces.\rThis film, released in France in 1960, was directed by Georges Franju and is typically regarded as an art-horror classic.  Its impact in the horror genre and in French cinema has since resulted in its inclusion in the Criterion Collection. \n"}]}
