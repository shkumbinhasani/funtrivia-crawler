{"id": "342671", "name": "Sharper Sticks Than Yours Quiz | General | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "General Knowledge Trivia", "  Thematic Fun"], "questions": [{"text": "British ceremonial occasions are full of pomp, circumstance, and people performing roles that were once vital but are now mainly for show. Traditionally the role of protecting the monarch was performed by two dignitaries whose glittering titles include the word 'stick' - but what sort of precious sticks are they?", "correct": "Gold Stick and Silver Stick", "options": ["Forked Stick and Pronged Stick", "Glue Stick and Gear Stick", "Sharp Stick and Super Stick"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGold Stick and Silver Stick.\n\n\tIn Tudor times, two officers of the military were given the task of acting as personal bodyguards to the sovereign during ceremonial occasions. Since Queen Victoria's reign, the role has been entirely ceremonial although they would probably leap into action if there was a real danger. The role of Gold Stick is held by two people, the Colonels in Chief of the Blues & Royals and of the Life Guards - both regiments in the Household Cavalry. Only one Gold Stick is on duty at any time and that one is then known as Gold Stick-in-Waiting. However, as the role of a Colonel in Chief is itself largely ceremonial, the duties that actually involve giving orders to the Household Cavalry are undertaken by Silver Stick, the Commander of the Household Cavalry who is a working colonel in the British Army. Scotland has its own Gold and Silver Sticks, who are the senior officers of the Sovereign's Bodyguard of the Royal Company of Archers.\r Flopsy understands that most of the world doesn't have the least idea who does what on British ceremonial occasions - she doesn't know much about it either but just rests on a pile of sticks to enjoy the show. \n"}, {"text": "Here is one British monarch who might have wished for some protection in the presence of small pointy objects. Who, allegedly, met his end with a red hot poker inside him?  ", "correct": "Edward II", "options": ["Richard III", "Henry VIII", "William IV"], "explanation": "\n\n\nEdward II.\n\n\tOr did he? The official chronicles describe his murder at Berkeley Castle in 1327. This was supposedly ordered by his wife, Isabella, and her lover, but there is plenty of room for doubt. Some accounts suggest that he escaped from his imprisonment and melted into obscurity. What is certain is that, prior to these events, he was forced to abdicate and his son, Edward III, assumed the throne.\r Glendathecat thinks it's a pretty extreme way to get a king to abdicate but they didn't have American divorcees in those days. \n"}, {"text": "While defending yourself against pointed sticks is an important skill to learn, there are other more dangerous armaments, according to a Monty Python skit. Despite Eric Idle's pleas for pointed stick defense training, drill instructor John Cleese taught a class in self-defense against which unusual weapon?", "correct": "Fresh fruit", "options": ["Nunchucks", "Samurai swords", "Cannons"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFresh fruit.\n\n\tThe class, consisting of Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin and Terry Jones, was subjected to lessons in defense against a variety of fruits, including passionfruits, oranges, apples, grapefruits, cherries and grapes, before Cleese taught them how to defend themselves against a man armed with a banana. The method of defense? Shoot the assailant and eat the banana. What if someone attacks you with a raspberry? Then drop a 16-ton weight on him. No 16-ton weight?  Well then release the tiger (which is especially effective since the tiger will also eat the raspberries).\r PDAZ doesn't believe that any animals were hurt during the filming of this skit since the tiger appeared to be fake.  The fruit looked real, though. \n"}, {"text": "An archer's favourite pointy stick is, of course, an arrow. Arrows have been used for centuries, possibly even millennia, to hunt and fight. What is the name given to the feathers on the end of an arrow?", "correct": "Fletching", "options": ["Plumage", "Aftershaft", "Hackle"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFletching.\n\n\tFletching has long been used on arrows to help keep it steady in flight. Typically, each fletch would be a feather, or part thereof, from a bird such as a goose, and be spaced evenly around the end of the arrow to keep it heading in the same direction when it has been shot from the bow. In more modern times, the feathers have been replaced by plastic fletches which are cut in the shape of a parabola to allow for optimal stabilisation. Other uses of fletching, or a design similar to that of fletching, outside of archery include darts, missiles and rockets. Essentially, it helps to stabilise fast-moving objects as they move through the air.\r Eburge frequently shoots arrows. He's just trying to get a point across. \n"}, {"text": "Pointy sticks can be useful as well as dangerous.  What craft usually requires that participants have two pointy sticks at their disposal?", "correct": "Knitting", "options": ["Crochet", "Embroidery", "Macrame"], "explanation": "\n\n\nKnitting.\n\n\tKnitting usually involves using two needles to manipulate a fibre (wool, cotton, or many other options) into a fabric.  Sometimes knitters use only a single circular needle with points at each end, when they plan to work in the round; sometimes they use four double-pointed needles to achieve the same effect.  Cable patterns require two standard needles plus a double-pointed needle or cable needle (although a crochet hook can be used it you can't find a proper cable needle).\r Embroidery is usually accomplished with a single sharp needle; crochet uses a hook rather than a needle with a pointy end; macrame is the art of knotting, and usually uses no sticks at all.\r Looney_tunes prefers knitting needles to many other forms of pointy stick. \n"}, {"text": "A dangerous weapon in the wrong hands, which of these pointed objects (with a handle, no less) was used by Sharon Stone's character to commit murder in the 1992 film \"Basic Instinct\"?", "correct": "Ice pick", "options": ["Tire iron", "Corkscrew", "Screwdriver"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIce pick.\n\n\tAn ice pick can certainly be a dangerous device.  Used to chisel away at solid ice, especially if you don't have handy-dandy plastic trays, this item is usually no bigger than a screwdriver; it's operated with one hand.\rIn Paul Verhoeven's 1992 film, \"Basic Instinct\", Catherine Trammel (played by Sharon Stone) supposedly commits murder in the opening scenes using the aforementioned tool.  The item makes a reappearance in the finale of the movie, incriminating her for the audience, but leaving Michael Douglas' character unknowing.  The ice pick was such a central motif of the film, small replicas (actually crafted into collectable pens) were released with special edition DVD copies of the film.  These too could be used for prodding.\r Of course...rabbits would never use such dangerous weapons, would they?  Kyleisalive hopes not. \n"}, {"text": "Although the majority of pointed sticks can be used as weapons, as Flopsy has taught us, some of the largest pointed sticks in the world are located in such inconvenient places that you couldn't retrieve them for use as weapons if you wanted to. Lightning rods are found atop skyscrapers, and are used to deflect lightning from hitting the building. What famous \"Founding Father\" of the United States of America invented these enormous sticks?", "correct": "Benjamin Franklin", "options": ["John Hancock", "John Adams", "James Madison"], "explanation": "\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin.\n\n\tBenjamin Franklin was famous for being a politician who helped to write the U.S. Constitution, but was also famous as a scientist and inventor. As well as the lightning rod, which he created in 1749, he was the first to make bifocals, swimfins, the urinary catheter, and the Franklin Stove. The much less famous Czech scientist V\u00e1clav Divis is credited with coming up with the lightning rod independently from Franklin, though he did so five years later.\r Although most lightning rods have a pointed end, it is not uncommon to see lightning rods with a ball at the top.\r WeirdAlLover wants you to believe that he is not currently plotting to take over the world using lightning rods. \n"}, {"text": "For all you sports fans out there, let's talk about the Olympic decathlon.  Which of the ten events involves throwing an object with a sharp point at the tip through the air, trying to make it stick in the ground further away from the starting point than is achieved by any of the other competitors?", "correct": "Javelin throw", "options": ["Discus", "Pole vault", "Shot put"], "explanation": "\n\n\nJavelin throw.\n\n\tAll four of these events are part of the decathlon, but neither the discus nor the shot could be described as having a sharp point at one end, and the pole used in the pole vault is never intentionally thrown through the air by competitors.  \r The javelin is a light spear, about 2.5 m (8 ft) in length.  Its origins lie in the military, where it was widely used to allow an offensive strike from a distance.  The athletes in this event, unlike other throwing events, run up to the delivery line to use their momentum as part of their propulsive effort.   The delivery line is actually a curved arc, the ends of which form the starting point for the two lines that define the sector (of 29 degrees, slightly less than a third of a right angle) in which the javelin must land (point first) for the throw to be considered legal.  The longest throw wins.  Competitors take turns to each make a throw, called a round.  A competition consists of a predetermined number of rounds, usually between three and six.  \r As well as being part of the men's decathlon, the javelin throw is included in the women's heptathlon, as well as being an event in its own right.  Looney_tunes would rather throw a javelin than catch one. \n"}, {"text": "Certainly one of the most powerful sharpened sticks is the pencil, an item that can craft written words and provide a harsh prodding if need-be.  Modern pencils contain graphite, but many often refer to the core of this implement using the name of which of the following materials found in early pencils?", "correct": "Lead", "options": ["Zinc", "Iron", "Tungsten"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLead.\n\n\tDespite the fact that graphite has been used as the inner material of the modern pencil for many decades, many have referred to the core of the pencil as a 'pencil lead'.  Graphite pencils are rated by the darkness of their markings and the hardness of the material itself.  Mechanical pencils (for which the lead can be replaced) also contains very thin graphite pieces made with these factors in mind.\r Graphite replaced lead as the main compound in 'pencil lead' mostly due to the fact that lead can be poisonous in high quantities.  Graphite is composed of carbon and is also used to make steel.\r Now that Kyle has posted a question about sharpened sticks, he won't be prodded by that certain rabbit. \n"}, {"text": "Britannia is a traditional symbol of Britain; the word has come to mean both Great Britain as a country and the personification of that country - a female figure armed with a shield, usually accompanied by a lion, just to make the point that the British Empire was not to be trifled with. Since Victorian times, Britannia has had a pointed weapon similar to that used by Poseidon - what was it called? ", "correct": "Trident", "options": ["Ardent", "Pepsodent", "Emollient"], "explanation": "\n\n\nTrident.\n\n\tWhen the Romans invaded the British Isles in 43 AD, they gave the name Britannia to the southern part of the island, i.e. most of England and all of Wales; they called the northern part \"Caledonia\" and built Hadrian's Wall to keep the Picts and Scots out. Even though the Romans left, various forms of the name Britannia stuck - including the words Briton and British to describe the original Celtic inhabitants. However, after the Middle Ages the term was widened to include the English (the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons) and to include the female warrior called Britannia.\r The figure of Britannia is a familiar symbol in Britain; there are probably far more statues of Britannia across Britain than there are of any real life kings or queens. Britannia has appeared on coins since 1672, on postage stamps, and on the seal of the Bank of England. The name Britannia is also used by organisations, companies, and especially the Royal Navy. And it is of course the title of a poem by James Thomson, set to music by Thomas Arne: Rule Britannia! - one of Britain's most well-known patriotic songs.\r Flopsy is going to get a trident, it might be much more effective than just a pointy stick! \n"}]}
