He also happens to be living at her house on the exchange.  Brittany believes that he's a leprechaun and while she doesn't really understand him because of his Irish accent, she asks for an all-marshmallow box of Lucky Charms, her favourite cereal.  He says he'll be able to do it.  When she leaves, Finn watches as he gets bullied by other kids.\rPuck and Quinn visit Shelby in the teacher's lounge and offer their babysitting services in order to let her get some rest; she's visibly fatigued.

Will considers finding an alternate way to fund the show.\rMercedes approaches Santana asking about how many solos she's been getting for Glee Club and suggests that she move over to Shelby's new Glee Club since it's an all-girls group and it's working really well for her.

With Mercedes gone, the group is down one of their best singers.  Rachel and Kurt are at each others' backs because of the school election and Rachel is worried that the play will be cut.  Will suggests that they sell ads in the play's program to raise enough money and Kurt offers to spearhead this operation.  Will assures everyone that they'll get through the rough patch despite Sue and that their dreams will come true this year.\rFinn finds the new kid, Rory Flanagan, sorting through a few boxes of Lucky Charms in an empty classroom and introduces himself.  Rory already knows who Finn is though, having watched the show choir video of him kissing Rachel at Nationals already.  Rory explains that he's living with Brittany and he wants to sleep with her; Brittany promised her pot of gold to him if she gets her three wishes.  He also says that he'd like to be friends with Finn and the two of them agree to this.

Puck seems worried by this, and reasonably so.\rKurt speaks to his dad about purchasing an ad in the school program and when he hears that the show is at risk, he speaks to three different funeral homes, each members of the local Rotary Club, and has them purchase enough ad space to pay for the play in full, saving the kids' production.

As it turns out, she feeds him nougat and sprinkles before bed and rubs his stomach with glitter sticks so that he'll poop candy bars.  Rory asks her to dinner but she says she would if she didn't already have plans.  Besides, he's only allowed to eat four-leaf clovers.  When she leaves, he sings \"It's Not Easy Being Green\".\rBrittany's date turns out to be with Santana and the two of them discuss their relationship and the possibility of switching Glee Clubs.

When Brittany returns home from finding Lord Tubbington at an Arby's, she finds Rory in her room making her second wish come true.  The two of them chat over a chocolate bar and he reveals that Santana wished she would defect to Shelby's show choir.  Brittany decides that she has to since it was a leprechaun wish.\rWill visits the auto shop to speak to Burt about running against Sue but Burt's way ahead of him-- he's already looked into it and while he can't appear on the ballot he can be a write-in candidate.

Puck says that he's always there for her if she needs the help.\rAt school, Rory alerts Finn to Brittany's plan to leave Glee Club so he goes to speak to her.  Santana interrupts and he tries to ignore her, telling Brittany that she probably doesn't even want to quit.

Santana says that she has one more wish...that he'll disappear.\rThe Hummels and Hudsons head out to dinner at Breadstix to discuss Burt's running for congress and they think about their futures.  Kurt is concerned that Sue will really lay into his father, especially after the heart attack he had the previous year.  Sue appears at that moment with a rather large burger: The Gut-Buster Extreme.  Rather than solely being anti-arts, she's decided to be pro-special education to beef up her side.\rAt school, Finn protects Rory from bullies from the school hockey team and grants him a wish.  Going into the choir room to find fewer members than usual, Finn brings Rory in to show off his talent.
