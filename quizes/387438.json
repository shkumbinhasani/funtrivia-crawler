{"id": "387438", "name": "How Do You Even Smash? Trivia Game | Super Smash Brothers Games | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Video \nGame Trivia", "Super Smash Brothers Games", "Super Smash Bros. Melee"], "questions": [{"text": "How would you perform Kirby's Final Cutter?", "correct": "Up-B", "options": ["Down-B", "C-Stick", "A"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUp-B.\n\n\tThe Final Cutter attack is a good technique for crowd control since it can move weaker and smaller enemies downward, catching them in the cut of Kirby's blade with a carefully-placed up-B, potentially sending them on a trip off the bottom of the stage if you're clever/lucky enough.  This attack typically isn't used as a killing blow though; although it's useful given the right circumstances, Kirby doesn't have the weight behind him to do significant damage with such a skill.  If the attack does not hit an enemy, the impact of Kirby's attack on the ground will send out a projectile wind blast. \n"}, {"text": "How would you cause Jigglypuff to sing?", "correct": "Up-B", "options": ["B", "Left or Right-B", "R"], "explanation": "\n\n\nUp-B.\n\n\tJigglypuff, another lightweight character, may seem fragile but can be devastating depending on the situation.  Her Up-B technique, allowing her to sing a hypnotic song, can put enemies to Sleep for a length of time reliant on their damage taken.  This, when used in conjunction with a team member's devastating blow could mean an easy kill, otherwise it can be used as a brief respite, allowing for a bit of reevaluation on the stage.  \"Super Smash Bros. 4\" customized the move further with variants. \n"}, {"text": "How do you move Ness' PK Thunder orb?", "correct": "With the analog stick", "options": ["With the C-Stick", "With the D-Pad", "With L and R"], "explanation": "\n\n\nWith the analog stick.\n\n\tPK Thunder, Ness' Up-B technique, allows him to shoot an orb of thunder and lightning into the air which he can control with the directional stick until it runs out after a few seconds.  Fortunately, this is enough; the skill can be used to strike a foe, nudging them off the edge of the map or canceling a certain attack, or it can be used by Ness himself.  If you strike Ness with the PK Thunder, it'll blast him in the direction it's aimed, potentially sending him colliding into an enemy.  Lucas had the same move upon introduction in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". \n"}, {"text": "Peach uses her Down-B to pull items out of the ground.  How many different items can she obtain in this way?", "correct": "Four", "options": ["One", "Two", "Three"], "explanation": "\n\n\nFour.\n\n\tFor the most part, Peach will pull a turnip out of the ground, much like she did in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\".  Turnips are quite useful though as, when used, they can disorient an enemy, knock them back, or knock out a shield depending on their appearances-- all you need to do is look at the face on the turnip.  If Peach is lucky, she'll also be able to draw a Bob-Omb, Beam Sword, or Mr. Saturn instead of an actual vegetable, but that's up to chance to decide. \n"}, {"text": "How many variations does Mr. Game and Watch's Judgement technique have?", "correct": "Nine", "options": ["Four", "Twelve", "Six"], "explanation": "\n\n\nNine.\n\n\tWith Game and Watch's Left-B/Right-B attack, he pronounces Judgement on a foe, striking them with a numbered sign, randomized with a number between 1 and 9.  Each of these numbers allows him to do a different thing ranging from a weak non-hit to a knockback KO-type move at 1 and 9 respectively.  Some of the weirder numbers include 5, which produces electrical attacks, and 8, which freezes the enemy in a block of ice. \n"}, {"text": "How does Link use the Boomerang in battle?", "correct": "Left-B/Right-B", "options": ["R", "C-Stick", "Down-B"], "explanation": "\n\n\nLeft-B/Right-B.\n\n\tLink started using the Boomerang with a simple click of the B button in the original \"Super Smash Bros.\", but was relegated to Left and Right-B for later games and replaced by the Fairy Bow as an additional long-range attack.  Nonetheless, the boomerang can be a useful item, creating distance between Link and other opponents.  The utility of this item became more prevalent in later versions of the game where the upgraded Gale Boomerang also moved enemies closer to Link with successful swings.  Young Link also uses the Boomerang. \n"}, {"text": "How is it possible for Pichu to hurt himself in battle?", "correct": "All of these are valid options", "options": ["By using his Down-B attack (Thunder)", "By using his B attack (Crawling Lightning)", "By accidentally blowing up a Bob-Omb"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll of these are valid options.\n\n\tPichu is an interesting character in that all of his electrical attacks (he is an Electric-type Pokemon) have the ability to deal recoil damage, hurting him while he hurts the enemy.  This, coupled with the fact that Pichu is one of the lightest characters in the game, means that he's not often picked due to his vulnerabilities.  Nonetheless, Pichu, typically regarded as a weak Pikachu clone, is one of the speediest characters in the roster and has the agility to make fast grabs and notably zippy Quick Attacks across the map. \n"}, {"text": "How many enemies, in a four player, non-team game, can be trapped in Yoshi's Egg Lay ability at one time?", "correct": "All three", "options": ["None", "Two", "One"], "explanation": "\n\n\nAll three.\n\n\tYoshi's Egg Lay, allowing him to gulp up opponents and lay them into an egg, may be a bit of an odd move, and one that's easy for skilled players to break out of, but it does provide Yoshi with helpful extra time to line up stronger attacks.  Nonetheless, it may not be the most-used move in his arsenal since other egg attacks and flutter jumps can cause a bit of havoc. Egg Lay can be used on all enemies on the map and, provided they're cooperative, all enemies can be laid in eggs at once.  This runs opposite to the game's Adventure Mode where useless enemies in side-scrolling levels are instantly defeated with the technique; that's just not so onstage. \n"}, {"text": "How would Zelda be able to transform into Sheik?", "correct": "Down-B", "options": ["Up-B", "By locating an item", "By killing a foe"], "explanation": "\n\n\nDown-B.\n\n\tBoth Zelda and Sheik have the same Down-b technique which allows them to transform back and forth between forms, thus creating two separate movesets for the sake of versatility.  While Zelda is primarily used for magical attacks (Nayru's Love, for instance), Sheik is a ranged fighter who uses shruikens and a short-ranged whip to keep enemies at bay.  She's the only character in this game to have two forms, though starting in \"Brawl\", Samus could transform into her Zero-Suit form. \n"}, {"text": "How can any character perform a taunt?", "correct": "D-Pad", "options": ["C-Stick", "L", "Start"], "explanation": "\n\n\nD-Pad.\n\n\tTaunting has no real purpose in battle in the way of attacks or defence, but every character has special ways of getting themselves across or provoking the enemy that may be fun to check out as far as easter eggs go.  In later games, each direction on the pad corresponds to a different taunt, with each character having three to show; in \"Melee\" (and the original game before it), each character only has one. \n"}]}
