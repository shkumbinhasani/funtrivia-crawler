One student rushed through the doors, explaining that someone was shooting in the school.  The librarian told the kids to hide, but Tate came in the back door, shooting the teacher through the torso and methodically killing the others hiding in the stacks.\rThe SWAT team heads to his bedroom to find him sitting calmly on the bed.

Running downstairs, she yells for her mother but finds Constance instead, smoking in the kitchen.  She knows she found out about Tate and she tells Violet that she shouldn't be so arrogant to assume that there are not realities other than her own.  Constance thinks that the house drove Tate to madness; they were living in it when he went on his killing spree.\rConstance brings Violet next door to meet her friend, Billie Dean Howard, a psychic medium who has been working with her for years.

Others, like Tate, don't know they're dead.  Constance wanted to send Tate to Ben for psychiatry sessions to give him some clarity, perhaps come to the realization himself.  Violet still doesn't believe any of this, but Billie Dean mentions Mary, Violet's grandmother, and her final words: \"they'll never understand you.\"\rAt night, Vivian has a nightmare that her child is inhuman.  As she rubs her pregnant belly, a three-fingered hand claws along her flesh from the inside.

Luke tells both of them to lock their doors; Hayden never made it to the police station and he doesn't know what happened to her.  When he leaves, Vivian angrily speaks to Ben about showing up at the house and he explains that he needs his study for patients.  They need the money and it's too expensive to rent an office.  She says it's too hard to look at him but he can use the house as long as he leaves immediately after his last session of the day.\rUpstairs, Violet imagines using a razor blade to cut her wrists and throat.  She hears Tate behind her, asking if she's scared\rBen's newest patient, Derek, is afraid of urban legends of all sorts.  Most specifically, he's afraid of 'Piggy Man', a hog butcher from Chicago who used to wear a pig mask, snorting in the slaughterhouse.  He fell one day and the hogs tore him apart.  His customers started to die and if you stand in front of a mirror saying \"Here piggy-pig-pig\" he'll come for you.

She fainted during the procedure; apparently she quit.\rViv hangs up the phone when Constance stops by with a platter.  Moira told her that Vivian has been struck with horrible morning sickness upon leaving the house and she decided to call upon an old family recipe.  Her mother always consumed offal during pregnancy for the sake of her children; Constance has brought sweetbreads-- thymus glands, a pancreas-- and they're full of all the vitamins and minerals she needs.  Moira offers to saute them with sweet butter.  Upon leaving, Constance says that they need the baby; they need another sweet child around here. \n"}, {"text": "When Derek looks into the Harmons' shower, who does he find?", "correct": "Gladys", "options": ["Hayden", "Moira", "Chad"], "explanation": "\n\n\nGladys.\n\n\tWhile cooking for Vivian, Moira says something she fears may be out of turn-- cheating on one's pregnant wife is unspeakable and on par with murder.  She feels that Ben would cheat again if given the chance.  Moira serves up the sweetbreads but leaves the pancreas raw as it's the tenderest of the organs and the one with the most nutritional value.\rBen brings Derek to the bathroom the next day for a small exercise.  While he stands outside the door, he asks Eric to go inside, in the dark (but with a flashlight) to face his fear of Piggy Man in front of the mirror.  When he chants the words and hears something behind the shower curtain, he looks inside to find Gladys, one of the sorority girls killed in the late-1960s.

Both Leah and Violet agree that they can't eat or sleep.  Leah takes pills; she hands Violet a bottle.\rViolet visits the library of Westfield High and speaks to the librarian who was shot through the door by Tate.  He thinks she's a sicko, but she insists that she isn't-- she just lives next door to the Langdons.  She continues to ask questions and hopes that perhaps there's a reason why he did it, but he can't give her a reason.  Some people, he explains, aren't good people. \n"}, {"text": "What happens when Vivian suggests that Moira will need to be let go as the maid of the household?", "correct": "Moira says she'll work for free", "options": ["Ben disagrees that she should be canned", "Violet pays for Moira herself", "Constance hires her"], "explanation": "\n\n\nMoira says she'll work for free.\n\n\tViv returns home with bad news for Moira.  When they both sit down at the kitchen table, Viv says that she'll have to let her go.  Moira wonders why-- the house is spotless-- but Viv says it just won't work since they need the money and they need to sell.  Moira offers to work for free until someone buys the property.  She'll keep it clean and attend to her during her time of need.  After all, Viv is pregnant.  She won't let this be a regret on her part.\rMoira offers Viv lunch as Constance has already delivered another delicacy.  This one is served raw so that she and the baby can ingest the full measure of vitamins.  It came from an organic farm and it's the most nutritious.

When she goes downstairs, she not only encounters the twins who died in the house in 1978, but Gladys, the home invaders, and Dr. Charles Montgomery, who emerges from the shadows to ask if his wife prepared her for the procedure.  Violet runs upstairs to her room to find her iPod playing on its dock at full volume.  She turns it off and finds a note from Tate saying \"I love you\".  Scared and frustrated, she cries and finds the bottle of pills in her bag.  She downs the bottle.\rShe passes out on the bed before Tate finds her, drags her down the hall, and puts her with him into the shower, helping her cough up the pills.  She regains consciousness in his arms and, discovering what has happened and where she is, she cries.\rLater, Ben has another session with Derek in the study.

The technician, Angela, says that she saw 'The Unclean Thing'...'The Beast'...in her womb.  She saw the hoofs.  Viv leaves, unable to listen to this crazy woman.\rDerek faces his fears.  Removing the sheet from his mirror at home, he chants the Piggy Man lines and feels foolish doing it.  Feeling home free, he puts down his flashlight only to see the shower curtain slide open.  A robber shoots him in the head, frustrated with the insult.  The man and his accomplice proceed to rob his house.\rConstance speaks to Billie Dean at home about Addy.  Apparently, Addy is disappointed in her from beyond the grave.  Constance wants to talk to her and she misses her, so Billie Dean helps her communicate.  Addy assures Constance that where she is, she will always be a pretty girl.  Constance apologizes to her for everything she's done in the past.  What shocks Constance is the fact that Addy is glad her mother didn't get her to the lawn of the Harmons' house in time.  She doesn't want to be with Tate now that she knows the truth.  In 1994, while the SWAT team had their guns fixed on him in his bedroom, he made the motions to reach for a pistol under his pillow and they opened fire.\rViolet reads a book once taken out of Westfield High's library by Tate.  He asks if she'll tell Ben and Viv about the pills but she says she won't.  He's afraid that she's changed her opinion towards him and he'll leave her alone if that's what she wants.  He loves her and wouldn't let anyone hurt her.  She says that she's sad but she asks him to join her on the bed.  Both of them are tired. \n"}]}
