For which single's video had Swift won an award?", "correct": "You Belong With Me", "options": ["Fearless", "Shake It Off", "Look What You Made Me Do"], "explanation": "\n\n\nYou Belong With Me.\n\n\tSwift had won the award for the video for 'You Belong With Me', which featured her playing both the heroine of the song and an evil cheerleader. During Swift's acceptance speech, West grabbed the microphone off her and said, \"Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!\" Beyonc\u00e9 was later awarded Video of the Year for 'Single Ladies', and called Swift back onstage to finish her speech.\r Feuds aside, this song was graciously recommended to us by CmdrK and the question was written by Kankurette. \n"}, {"text": "Youssou N'Dour sings a closing to which Peter Gabriel track in his native Wolof (Senegalese) language?", "correct": "In Your Eyes", "options": ["In Your Mind", "In Your Heart", "In Your Soul"], "explanation": "\n\n\nIn Your Eyes.\n\n\tPeter Gabriel has long been an advocate and promoter of the world music scene and was fascinated by the ambiguity in African songs when writing of the love between a man and a woman, and people and God. The song appears on Gabriel's 1986 album \"So\" and peaked at number twenty six on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts.\r PDAZ originally requested this song and Pollucci19 delivered with a question here. \n"}, {"text": "Confronting the battles drug users have with their addictions is which song, the third single, released on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2000 album \"Californication\"?", "correct": "Otherside", "options": ["Under the Bridge", "Give It Away", "Suck My Kiss"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOtherside.\n\n\tIn his 2004 autobiography Anthony Kiedis details that this track refers to his own drug addiction, describing how he'd stay clean for a while and then would come the \"slide\" as described in the lyrics. Some observers also point to former RHCP member Hillel Slovak as being a possible inspiration for this track. Slovak would pass away in 1988 after a heroin overdose and members of the band, particularly Flea, have described him as an inspiration and an influence.\r Complete with a strong melody and a memorable chorus, the track would peak at number fourteen on Billboards' Hot 100 chart and would be one of the band's best selling singles. The remaining tracks named above were all singles taken from the band's 1991 album \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\".\r It doesn't matter how long (how long) we let this question slide; Pollucci19 took care of it based on a recommendation from Abby_91. \n"}, {"text": "Which 2016 hit from country singer Dierks Bentley took us somewhere that wasn't country?", "correct": "Somewhere on a Beach", "options": ["Somewhere on a Mountain", "Somewhere That's a Bar", "Somewhere on the Plains"], "explanation": "\n\n\nSomewhere on a Beach.\n\n\tBentley spits some vitriol as he runs away from the aftermath of a relationship in this 2016 single that would provide him with his fourteenth number one hit on the US Billboard's Hot Country Songs charts. Singing to his ex, he tells her that he's having fun, he's drinking lots and not getting much sleep in a song that many observers are declaring a sequel to his 2014 hit \"Drunk on a Plane\". The musical style has been compared favourably to that of Kenny Chesney and the song would achieve platinum status (sales of over one million units) in the US.\r This country single comes from Teacher47 and the question itself came from, once again, Pollucci19. \n"}, {"text": "Kansas was an influential progressive rock band that only had one top top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100. What was the title of this 1978 song? ", "correct": "Dust in the Wind", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nDust in the Wind.\n\n\tKansas formed in 1970 in Topeka, Kansas when two local bands formed a progressive rock group. Known primarily as an album-oriented band with three platinum albums, their first Billboard Hot 100 top twenty hit was \"Carry On Wayward Son\" in 1977. \"Dust in the Wind\", a finger-picking ballad and a departure from their style of music, peaked at number six on the same chart a year later.\r Much thanks to 1nn1 for this question on a rock classic.

Despite the song's success, the group never had another song land on either chart, making it the perfect example of a one hit wonder. The song finds pop-rock duo Zager and Evans guessing how long humanity may survive, and what the world may look like centuries in the future. It has since been covered and referenced numerous times, including by television shows such as \"Futurama\" and movies like \"Alien 3\". Interestingly, the song was unofficially blacklisted by US radio station owners Clear Channel (now iHeartRadio) in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks due to its \"lyrically questionable\" content in this context.\r \"1979\" is a Smashing Pumpkins song from the 1995 album \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\", \"Sixty Years On\" is an Elton John track from his 1970 self-titled album, and \"How Many More Years\" is a 1951 Howlin' Wolf single.\r Daaanieeel brings us to the future with a look back at this song, a request from WesleyCrusher. \n"}, {"text": "Which of the following Roy Orbison songs sold in excess of seven million copies and is generally regarded as the high point of the singer's career?", "correct": "Oh, Pretty Woman", "options": ["Only the Lonely", "In Dreams", "Cryin'"], "explanation": "\n\n\nOh, Pretty Woman.\n\n\tA simple remark by Roy Orbison's co-writer, Bill Dees, was the trigger for this song.

As she walked away, Roy asked her if she needed money, to which Dees replied; \"A pretty woman never needs any money.\" The song would be named one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll in 1999.\r This one's a question from author Pollucci19 and the song was sent in to us by Dcpddc478. \n"}, {"text": "Adele's album \"21\" was very successful, receiving multiple accolades including two Grammy Awards.

After releasing her debut album \"19\", Adele rose to stardom with the many hits of her second album, \"21\", with hit songs like \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Someone Like You\". Unlike many of the powerful, heartbreak-based songs in the album, Rumour Has It\" is a somewhat more upbeat and kiss-off style tune. It was released on November 5, 2011, and co-written by Adele and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder.\r Hello.  It's Lpez's question.  I've been wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.

In 1986, Bon Jovi launched their third album, \"Slippery When Wet\", which included the song \"You Give Love a Bad Name\". The song starts with the lyrics: \"shot through the heart, and you're to blame, darling you give love a bad name\".\r This deep cut comes to us from Joepetz though the question came from Lpez. \n"}, {"text": "Kirsty MacColl's song \"Caroline\" (1994) and \"Diane\" (2017) by Cam are both answer songs, replying to what 1973 country music hit?", "correct": "Jolene", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nJolene.\n\n\tDolly Parton's 1973 smash, \"Jolene\" saw her pleading with Jolene not to take her man. In MacColl's reply, singing as Jolene she admitted to sleeping with Caroline's man, a fact made worse by the fact that Jolene and Caroline are friends.
