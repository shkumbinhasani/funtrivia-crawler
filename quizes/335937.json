{"id": "335937", "name": "Hershey Goes Again Quiz | Other Music | 10 Questions", "type": "", "difficulty": "Very Easy", "tags": ["Home", "Quizzes", "Music Trivia", "Other Music", "Music Word Play"], "questions": [{"text": "To play this quiz, you'll need to be thinking on your toes!  I'll ask you a question about a song, but you have to change some of the words to add a candy into it.  For instance, if I asked about a Velvet Underground song that includes some chocolaty lyrics, the answer would be \"Hershey Goes Again\".\n\nIf you were to sing a Jason Derulo song, tweaking lyrics a bit to make it a song with chocolate covered caramels in the title, what would the new title be?", "correct": "Riding Rolo & Ridin Rolo & Ridin' Rolo", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nRiding Rolo & Ridin Rolo & Ridin' Rolo.\n\n\tJason Derulo's song \"Riding Solo\" was one of his many hit singles from his 2010 self-titled album.  Rolo is a tube of chocolate covered caramels, produced by Nestle, except where in the United States, it is distributed by Hershey.\r Combining \"Riding Solo\" and \"Rolo\" gets you the song \"Riding Rolo\" by Jason DeROLO. \n"}, {"text": "Michael Franti leads the band Michael Franti and Spearhead, which gives us a song about caramel and peanuts.  What is the name of this mish-mash candy smash?", "correct": "Payday & Pay Day", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nPayday & Pay Day.\n\n\t\"Say Hey\" was the biggest hit on Michael Franti and Spearhead's 2008 album \"All Rebel Rockers\".  The full title is \"Say Hey (I Love You)\", but that would be too mean of me to make you type.  ;-)  Payday is a candy bar made by Hershey.  It has a caramel center wrapped in peanuts.  So, the new candy song is simply titled \"Pay Day\". \n"}, {"text": "Tony Bennett sings a song about candy, too.  This song is about a cookie with caramel on it, and covered in chocolate.  It's only a one word song, and because it's not that well-known and because Bennett has a ton of albums, I'll give you a hint; it's on his \"I Wanna Be Around\" album.  What new name would be given to this song to make it about candy?", "correct": "Twix", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nTwix.\n\n\tTony Bennett has made dozens of albums, and has had countless singles over the years.  However, his song \"Tricks\" was not as well known as some of his others, such as \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\".  \"Tricks\" was on Bennett's 1963 album \"I Wanna Be Around\".  Twix is produced by Mars, but was previously known as Raider in many countries until it was changed to Twix to match the name used in North America. Twix is made from two long cookies with caramel on top and covered in chocolate.  Usually there are two sticks of Twix in the mix, but for this quiz, \"Tricks\" is nixed and \"Twix\" is used instead. \n"}, {"text": "Rihanna has a song that sounds very candy-like.  What would her song be called if it was about a small, circular piece of chocolate that is covered in a candy coating?", "correct": "M&M", "options": ["Skittle", "Nerdz", "Sixlet"], "explanation": "\n\n\nM&M.\n\n\tRihanna is a Barbadian-born singer.  Her big hit \"S&M\" was released late in the year 2010 on the album \"Loud\", but was not a single until early 2011.  M&Ms are candies made by Mars, and M&M actually stands for the surnames of the founders of the company, Mars and Murray.  An M&M can come in all different types, like milk chocolate, peanut, dark chocolate, dark chocolate peanut, mint, crisped rice, peanut butter, raspberry, pretzel, coconut, almond, and orange.\r I could have used rapper Eminem for the question, but voted against it since this quiz is about music, not artists.  :-) \n"}, {"text": "Come and taste the rainbow!  This Reba McEntire song is about taking off her wedding ring, but when it's paired with a fruity candy, it becomes a song about taking off a candy ring!  What song would this become?", "correct": "Skittle Rock", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSkittle Rock.\n\n\tReba McEntire's 1986 hit \"Little Rock\" came from her album \"Whoever's in New England\".  Skittles are chewy and fruity candies, with a wide variety of kinds, that are produced by Wrigley, which is owned by Mars.  When you mix \"Little Rock\" with Skittles you get the new candied hit \"Skittle Rock\". \n"}, {"text": "If Patsy Cline sang a song about a peanut butter cup, what would the song be called?", "correct": "I Fall to Reeses & I Fall to Reese's", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nI Fall to Reeses & I Fall to Reese's.\n\n\tPatsy Cline's second album, released in 1961, was entitled \"Patsy Cline Showcase\".  It featured many of her now famous songs, including \"I Fall to Pieces\".  Combine that with the Hershey Company's peanut butter cup, and the title now becomes \"I Fall to Reeses\". \n"}, {"text": "Enrique Iglesias sings a song about a white fudge covered candy bar.  What is the simple one-word song title, in candy?", "correct": "Zero", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZero.\n\n\tEnrique Iglesias released his song \"Hero\" in 2001.

If you combine a song on the album \"X&Y\" with a candy, what does the new song title become?", "correct": "Speed of Mounds", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nSpeed of Mounds.\n\n\tColdplay released their hit song \"Speed of Sound\" on their album \"X&Y\" in 2005.  Mounds is a coconut bar covered in chocolate.  The slogan \"sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't\" refers to both Mounds and Almond Joy.  An Almond Joy is just like Mounds, but with an almond on the candy bar as well.\r If you combine Coldplay's song with the candy, it becomes \"Speed of Mounds\". \n"}, {"text": "The Fugees sing a song with a title the same as the album it comes from.  But if you rewrite the title a bit, it becomes a song about a Hershey's toffee product.  What song would be the new tasty title?", "correct": "The Skor & Skor", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nThe Skor & Skor.\n\n\tThe Fugees released \"The Score\" in 1996.

Skor is called Rutnam in Canada. \n"}, {"text": "This song is perhaps David Bowie's most famous.  But when you combine it with fruity chewy square candies, once called Opal Fruits, it transforms into a deliciously fruity classic.  What would Bowie's new song be called?", "correct": "Ziggy Starburst & Lady Starburst", "options": [], "explanation": "\n\n\nZiggy Starburst & Lady Starburst.\n\n\tDavid Bowie's famous songs \"Ziggy Stardust\" and \"Lady Stardust\" both appeared on his album \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\", released in 1972.

When you cross \"Ziggy Stardust\" with Starburst, it becomes the tangy fruit song, \"Ziggy Starburst\". \n"}]}
